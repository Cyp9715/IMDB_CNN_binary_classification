for those who might not know the name director martin mcdonagh is an irish playwright who won the oscar last year for his short film six shooter about a chance encounter on a train and that films star brendan gleeson has returned as ken one of two hit men sent to the medieval city of bruges in belgium along with his partner ray colin farrell to rest and lay low after a hit gone horribly wrong ray is a miserable bastard who makes it clear hes not happy about being but ken convinces him that their boss harry has a job for them there as well as allowing them a chance for some sightseeing none of which improves rays mood things look up when he meets the beautiful local woman chloe played by french actress clmence posyyou may remember her as fleur delacore in harry potter and the goblet of fireand scores himself a date which also goes horribly wrong due to ray shooting off his big mouth from there things continue to go south as ray and ken get into all sorts of messes and meet strange characters all of whom will play a part in the larger picturethere arent too many nonbelgian films set in belgium and bruges is a beautiful but odd place to set an entire movie youll probably learn more about the place than you ever need to know as ken narrates their sightseeing excursions with a few factoids about the place the entire first act is driven by the chemistry between farrell and gleason as they deliver rapidfire patter that reminds one of mcdonaghs background as a playwright but it makes them as immediately endearing as vincent and jules in pulp fiction allowing for an even bigger impact as things happen to them our first encounter with the boys boss harry is an expletive filled telegraph and an equally amusing phone conversation with ken making it obvious that this is a mobster cut from the same cloth as ben kingsleys don logan those who dont recognize the voice will be thrilled when they learn who plays harry because its a pleasant surprisethis is easily colin farrells best role and performance in a long time one that allows him to show a lot of range not just as the bigmouthed prat we assume ray to be but also as a thoughtful man distraught about what happened in london having seen the error of his ways he feels the need to make right even if he hides it with a lot of complaining and arguments and that carries over to gleasons ken continuing his great run with mcdonaghmcdonagh has created a clever script that interweaves its small cast of characters into an intricate crime caper that mixes humor violence and true heartfelt human emotions into a brilliant debut feature just when you think you know where things are going mcdonagh throws a sharp curve ball at you and then another and another and pretty soon what started as a twohanded talkie has turned into a holdyourbreath action flick when harry turns up to rectify some business that ken has botched even so it never loses what made the first half so charming and entertaining because mcdonaghs impressive dialogue remains at the forefront for the extended confrontation between ken and harry the ending might be somewhat grim for some tastes going by the lightness of whats gone before but the way everything is tied together makes it all worth itanyone worried that tarantino and ritchies best work might be behind them can revel in the promise of mcdonaghs take on the crimecomedy genre as this talented filmmaker shows that six shooter was no fluke and this movie begins whats likely to be a long and promising film career on top of that if doesnt end up being the funniest and most quotable movies of the year then it should be very close,black_comedy
this movie is everything i love about movies its got great acting great characters great story great dialogue its nothing short of amazing i havent seen farrell in a roll like this before but he certainly shines going from being a brat to coked up as all hell to depressed in a matter of minutes and its hilarious as well as heart breakinggleeson is fantastic in his role too he plays a perfect mix of cold and calculating still being sophisticated and also has a conscience of sortsevery scene in this movie develops either character or story and the story unfolds so flawlessly with every passing scene going from thinking ray is just being an arrogant brat to realizing what he has done and why hes acting like he is is a truly fascinating journey and you cant quite tell whether to laugh or be upset by it sometimes doing a bit of both at oncethe dialogues and delivery are truly perfect and it leaves us with so many quotable lines about topics from saving someone you were going to kill from suicide and having a discussion with him about it afterwards to race wars with midgets sorry dwarves the wife telling harry to bring the fellas as he leaves and him apologizing for calling her an inanimate object because he was upset brings so much depth to characters and their relationship only from a minutelong scene true magic with regards to acting and dialogue this is why dialogue and acting is so important it brings us closer to the person behind the character and gives the story immensely more depth and excitementa cinematic masterpiece,black_comedy
two irish hit men brendan gleeson and colin farrell are sent into hiding by their british boss ralph fiennes belgium after a botched job only to learn that the most damning job awaits one of them just around the corner bruges is a picturesque tourist trap built around the oldest and best maintained medieval city in belgium director and screenwriter martin mcdonagh bleeds the setting and the material for all its worth and makes his feature film debut in superb stylethe dark comedy built around the existential quandaries of hit men has been done to death over the years if last summers you kill me was the relentlessly dark and relentlessly sitcomy take on the genre then is the hipster art film take on the theme mcdonagh deserves all the credit in the world for breathing life into the stale story by texturing the tonal shifts with crisp digital camerawork that is surprisingly haunting deep character development and by creating a wonderful sense of place imagine a graham greene novel brighton rock specifically comes to mind modernized by david mamet the dialog is super smart and wickedly unpc while the comedy parts are as gutbusting as the crime thriller parts are suspensefulmcdonagh has also brought together an outstanding cast who thrive in the material farrell defies all odds and manages to be as sympathetic in the dramatic parts as he is charmingly sarcastic in the comedic parts brendan gleeson gives a fantastically nuanced portrayal as farrells mentor and friend meanwhile ralph fiennes channels the scaryashell energy hes used previously in schindlers list and the recent harry potter films in a limber subversion that is a frighteningly fun to watch the supporting cast is to die for with jordan prentice spoton as a cokedup dwarf actor shooting an abhorrent art film on the streets of bruges and clemence poesy coyly seductive and unforgettable as farrells unlikely local love interestultimately meanders down too many cobblestone paths and one scene near the end involving a bell tower stretches credibility but adds necessary dramatic effect certain plot elements will turn off a large segment of the viewing audience however those with the right mindset will be greatly rewarded is hilarious contemplative sometimes scathing often nihilistic but marked by a shockingly hopeful undercurrent while tones shift and the colors of the human condition undulate in mcdonaghs insightful light the arrival of a commanding talent has been heraldedin bruges,black_comedy
going into this movie i didnt have the highest expectations for it however i went to see it anyways and let me just say that by the end credits i was completely shocked out how much i actually liked this movie it was not only very funny but you were able to connect with the characters in a way you didnt think you would the plot was def very interesting and kept my attention the whole way through only real problem i had with the movie was that it was a little bit too long but it didnt take away from anything i should also say that im not a huge colin farrell fan but after this movie i believe that he has proved that he can hold his own with the other leading men out there i thought there were some beautiful moments that they captured on film where you see him dealing with his characters inner demons i would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for something different if youre sick of seeing the same hollywoodesque movies then please give this movie a shot if anything enjoy it for the witty dialogue,black_comedy
a european film through and through showing its deep theatrical roots works on may levels and is a fine night at the cinemathe film follows the denouement of a job gone bad for two irish hit men who are forced to hole up belgium and really cant stand the inactivity the forced waiting a symbolic purgatory in both assassins struggle for absolution gives brendan gleeson and colin farrell a chance to act through some marvelous comic dialoguethe film itself looks like it was filmed in an area of the old city of bruges that is no more than a 500 square metre radius it doesnt matter because the film is a character study more than anything and like all good theatre the character interplay allows the audience to forget the confined spacesralph fiennes comes into the film late basically stealing ben kingsleys character from sexy beast this has to be an absolutely deliberate choice so cant really be criticized the writing is so good that fiennes can have real fun with it all the actors do as a matter of facti have been deeply suspicious of colin farrells ability to read a script in the past his choices of projects in the past has been spotty not this time his acting ability is brought to the fore by director and screenwriter martin mcdonagh farrell gives a very strong performance as a morally challenged hitmanbrendan gleeson has been around forever and is a renowned character actor you may remember him from braveheart as hamish campbell mel gibsons loyal adjutant he is able to completely bury himself in this part colin farrell has the capacity to reach these heights as well and in fact in this film shows many of the mannerisms and intensity of russell crowe whom i consider to be the best actor on the planeti appreciated the comedy and satire working hand in hand with the moral complexity of the characters inner struggles it makes for a very satisfying film one that is much more than entertainment when you consider what the budget was in comparison to many hollywood films serves as a reminder that it is the script and the quality of the direction that makes a film why hollywood thinks they can just throw money into a project and expect people to come to the cinema is beyond me,black_comedy
one of the problems with seeing a trailer for a film is it creates an expectation if it raises expectations and the film delivers great however if the film is less then expected then the viewer feels cheated the best case scenario is the one i found myself in before i saw low expectationsafter seeing the trailer looked like a plodding british comedy with little originality and repetitious humor hence the low expectations yet exceeded my minimal expectations and unlike my impression from the trailer was an original drama with good acting and a nice blend of comedy mixed in it was funny in the right places and appropriately dramatic when the story shifted into high gear towards the endset in no surprise here bruges belgium the plot focuses on two london hit men ray played by colin farrell and ken played by brendan gleeson the pair is sent to belgium after ray botches his first hi and therein lies the humor ray has no interest in being in the medieval city and ken wants to sight seeive never really liked colin farrell but who knew he had such a good sense of comedic timing there is a running gag involving fighting with a bottle and karate that he manages to keep fresh as it pops up throughout the film brendan gleesons character provides the moral center and plays the straight man to farrells ray this works well as the movie turns more serious towards the end however for my money the best performance is delivered by ralph fiennes who plays harry the pairs criminal overlord back in london whereas gleeson character embodies the moral center fienness harry fills the role of principled immorality if there is such a thing fiennes creates a character with a dubious moral center and is a quite believable figure of menace when he travels to bruges to square off with ken also of note is jordan prentice an irritable dwarf whos in town to act in a movie filming there his ramblings in one scene about a coming race war is worth the price of admission right therethe only aspect of the film that didnt work for me was rays love interest early in the film he manages to woo chloe a drug dealer with drum roll please a heart of gold for my tastes the budding romance seems a little forced and comes across more as a vehicle for jokes and drama but its a small thing and i doubt anyone but me would noticei intentionally left a lot of plot points out because as ive mentioned this film surprised me in a good way and i dont wont to ruin it for anyone elseis a good film go see itat the very least itll make you want to visit bruges,black_comedy
ive used imdb for years but have never felt the urge to post a review until now i had the pleasure of attending an advanced screening of this movie in nyc last night to which colin farrell attended i bought the screening tickets just wanting to bring my fianc to see some celebrities in person while not knowing much about the movie i figured it would be a hardtounderstand foreign indie film whose humor would be lost on a dumb american however the truth was absolutely the opposite my hardtoplease fianc agreedthe movie is a bit slow for the first half but its entirely necessary to set the mood and the contrast between that and the second half thats all ill say so as not to spoil anything it is really a great movie theres comedy beautiful cinematography and awesome action scenes albeit scattered throughout and absent at times when the viewer may be growing weary id highly recommend seeing this movie its definitely worth the price of a movie ticket while most of the crap out there these days isnt worth the cost of the paper they print the tickets onlet us all know what you think after you see it,black_comedy
a lot of reviews see fit to give a thorough plot summary so ill just talk bllocks insteadis a grown up gangster film not because it uses the word fck very often though it does because even a child can type fck repetitively into a screen play and judging by most recent gangster films with a few notable exceptions that wouldnt be too far from the truthis a grown up genre film not because it hangs out in galleries and cathedrals like a tapestry woven by brueghels mistress from blood sin and judgement though it doesis a black comedy for grown ups not because it consciously satisfies our skulking childishness our incorrect urge to lash out at convention  say fck the lot o yas fist someone in the mouth for good measure and then offer a fast talking and wickedly funny apology and it does all that toois grown up cinema because despite being sexy fun and stylish it is emotionally literate is that allowedthe complexity of martin mcdonaghs screen play is manifold developing and delineating character through dialogue as much as action brendan gleeson and colin farrel inhabit their characters with equal and at times forceful skill displaying flawless comic timing and sensitivity together they breathe real life into the hyperbolic corpse of a bloated genre that never quite realised it died some time ago mcdonaghs characters realise too late theyve been cnts one way or another and far too late begin to grow characters with history in emotional distress barely conscious or all too aware they do what we might in their shoes and as they trace the outline of their own destruction in lines of cocaine or spilled beer their conceit self loathing compassion or stubbornness lays them all bare there is a cost for all of them characters on a human scale acting out their tragedy in recognisable terms is as morally instructive as it is dramatically satisfying almost becoming a medieval mystery play in the setting of the titlefinally is a dangerously perfect fusion of plot meaning and story ripples of understanding run back and forth across the surface of the experience hinting at the themes which swim powerfully beneath a film this genuinely startling doesnt happen very often,black_comedy
i think that i will shortly be purchasing the oscar winning short film six shooter from 2004 ive got an itunes gift card for just the job the thought occurred to me after seeing the wonderful debut from director martin mcdonagh after seeing the trailer which really worked for me many times and wondering at how it is from an oscar winning director yet never hearing of the name i did some research while he already has more little gold men than alfred hitchcock his actual feature premiere is what has opened this weekend it is irish most definitely and if you have trouble with the accent maybe you should steer clear until in comes out on dvd however if you can cope this is a smart pitch black comedy when i say pitch black i mean black hole expanse of darkness the trailer leads you to believe it will be an uproarious time and while it is very funny and very smart there is a tragic event that is held over the proceedings lending a somber shadow over all that occurs in the end though it is consistent with its wit and drama telling an intriguing story and never relying on the laughs to hide any plot point that the creators may not have wanted to work out to completionif i am to gripe about anything it will be the ending not the very end however as that is absolutely perfect the camerawork voiceover and final shot cannot be argued it is the climax that happens just before that rings false it is the only moment like that though so i dont hold it against the film mcdonagh needed a way to get his characters to their arcs conclusions and if that means turning one of the roles at first seeming to be there for jokes into a pawn for a symmetrical kind of convenience ill give him that reprieve as far as fitting with the story yeah it works it has to because the incident is alluded to unknowingly at many times during the course of the sightseeing romp i guess i think it fits too well and wish mcdonagh could have come up with another way to do itbesides that though is a great time at the theatre colin farrell is steadily becoming a favorite of mine with his precise comic timing and broad facial expressions i may be one of the few people on earth that loved his comedic turn in woody allens cassandras dream yes i truly believe the comedy was intentional and here he shows it was not a fluke kind of similar to his scenestealing role in intermission he is a punk with a lousy disposition and disregard for tact here however he also has a conscience this tugofwar is ripe for laughs as he is a sweet guy he just doesnt know how to keep his mouth shut oneliners are in abundance and you will be laughing continuously brendan gleeson helps this fact by being an effective straightman to play off of he knows the score and tries to enjoy the fairytale city while his cohort sulks and puts on moods like a five year old because honestly unless you grew up on a farm and were slightly retarded bruges is really just hell on earth actually the city looks pretty great and i wouldnt mind checking it out once in my lifetime the periphery roles and there are many also add depth and interest to the film small characters like eric godons alcove loving gun dealer jordan prentice as a horsetranquilizer taking midget actor he played howard the duck that is awesome and clmence posy as the love interest and enigma chol all are fun and never quite feel just thrown in as jokes but instead integral parts to the story of course the great ralph fiennes is involved too his accent and vocabulary rivals ben kingsley in sexy beast and unfortunately is a much smaller part than anticipated from the trailer well maybe not unfortunately because if he was in more it might have become a gimmick i also couldnt help stop thinking of harry potter with madeye moody lord voldemort and fleur delacour all involvedi highly recommend this film for anyone looking to see a good drama with comic overtones dont go in thinking this is to be a total good time with laughs a minute there is so much more to the tale that you may not expect or necessarily be hoping for at times it is very dark and drains every molecule of happiness out of your heads but thankfully a good joke or line will be coming shortly to alleviate the depression,black_comedy
greetings again from the darkness award winning playwright martin mcdonagh brings his amazing writing talents to the big screen and scores with his first turn as a feature film director the city of bruges yes in belgium is the perfect setting for the multilayered story its well preserved medieval architecture is like an character unto itselfcolin farrell delivers by far his best performance to date he is funny dangerous sexy and emotional throughout this is exceptional acting from a guy who tends to disappoint of course it helps to have magnificent writing and this one most certainly delivers on that front the dialogue is quirky and quick  so tune in earlystrong work also from brendon gleeson who all will recognize from gangs of new york and the harry potter series he is a tough guy with a streak of humanity the third piece of the puzzle is ralph fiennes as the mastermind bad guy the supporting work is fine from jordan prentice as the dwarf actor sadly mr prentice is most famous for playing howard the duck and a very cute clemence poesy as farrells odd love interestvery few writers can write dialogue like this and even fewer can juggle as many layers without making a film seem busy crowded or forced hopefully mr mcdonagh will bring more of his work to the big screen  he certainly adds a touch of class,black_comedy
well to be honest i wasnt sure what to expect from this film nor am i fan of colin farrell in fact i really didnt like him at all previouslybut now i have a new found respect for him and with gleason and fienes both in excellent form coupled with a very quick and witty script and some surprisingly violent scenes this film really has something for everyone except the young kidsi go to see 2 or 3 movies every week and this is just about the best one ive seen since last king of scotland and the departed came out a couple of years back1010,black_comedy
martin mcdonagh is a new name for me but it reeks of sounds and smells i recognize and love joe ortonish if you know what i mean a mishmash of blame and redemption of all places colin farrell is superb as the child killer devoured by his own conscience his dialogue is brutally funny but if we follow his eyes hes stuck on the same place the child his deathbrendan gleesons interest and what bruges has to offer is hysterically funny and deeply moving a monumental performance ralph finnes in a totally new vest if you forget schindlers comes to revolutionize the third act with a few aces up his sleeve he is as much fun to watch as he is frightening an unexpected treat i highly recommend it,black_comedy
the films that i find myself thinking about afterwards are of two kinds  the best and the worst in the case of the worst i am trying to work out just why they are so bad in the case of the best like the rare 10s they make such an impact that i cannot get them out of my head it was only later that i realised that martin mcdonagh has apparently lifted his basic situation  two hit men whiling away the time waiting for instructions as to their next victim  from harold pinters early oneact stage play the dumb waiter however the dumb waiter ends when the message the same one as in arrives mcdonagh then extends the scenario in quite unexpected directions the foundations of which have been meticulously laid sometimes by a mere throwaway line or gesture earlier in the film the film is full of memorable moments  dialogue incident or characterisation  that interweave to form an indelible impressionsome of the comments posted seem to take exception to the fact that is difficult to categorise  that terrible compulsion of the film industry to fit every film into a genre this is a film that is genuinely uncategorisable it is often very funny sometimes poignant and touching sometimes darkly frightening always thoughtprovoking to categorise it as say a comedythriller would be to seriously sell its qualities shortthere is one very good reason for the films special elusive quality  it is very irish although strictly speaking it would not count as an irish production and martin mcdonagh was born in london all his stage writing stems from a strong irish sensibility and it is no accident that the two leading characters are played by irish actors albeit actors familiar to an american audience playing americans the ability to see pathos behind humour as well as the funny side of tragedy is a peculiarly irish traitthe brilliance of the script is matched by superb performances from the two leads as well as all the supporting cast however small the part the only weak link and it is a very minor criticism is ralph fiennes as the boss figure who as one other posting commented was more convincing on the phone than in person perhaps as many have pointed out because of unfavourable comparison with ben kingsley in sexy beast brendan gleeson is as always impeccable colin farrell gives his best performance since intermission both are subtle and totally believable the supporting characters are so effective partly because they are very well cast partly because they have been written with such attention to detail almost my favourite moment is when the hotel owner hands over a phone message from the boss carefully typed out including all the obscenities with a personal handwritten correction at the bottom  i am not the receptionisti am hoping that by writing the above i will be able to stop myself thinking about but somehow i doubt it,black_comedy
what drove me to seeing in the first place was primarily great actors like brendan gleeson and ralph fiennes and also for the concept and bruges itself is definitely not for all tastes one can say that for a lot of films but is one of the more extreme examples it is very foul mouthed with an extreme profanity laden script is very uncompromisingly violent and its political incorrectness will put the easily offended and the faint hearted off three reasons not to see it if all this bothers you it didnt bother me much though having seen plenty of films with those approaches that still manage to be great neither did on the most part the ridiculousness that has been criticised forwhat is meant by on the most part weakest element from a storytelling standpoint and for the film in general is the ending this to me was the only part of the film that went over the top on the ridiculousness to overblown proportions and it just felt contrived and running out of ideas in feel carter burwells music score is a well written and quite lovely one on its own within the film and its mood though it didnt fit however and juxtaposes too much in terms of tonehowever the performances are very good excellent in the case of gleeson as always and fiennes having tons of fun as his sinister character wasnt expecting acting this good from farrell this is the best hes ever been and he is successful in providing an interesting character that was intended to be morally complex and not likeable its the relationship between farrell and gleeson that drives the story and drama it was essential to the films success and manages to be entertaining affecting and thoughtprovokingphotography is both gritty and beautiful with a clear sense of style and atmosphere bruges not just looks wonderful it also is treated like a character of its own quite rightlysimilarly successful is the script which is surprisingly intelligent with a strong balance with thoughtprovoking philosophical musings very funny black comedy and character moral complexity not making the characters likeable but it was clear early on that the intent was for them never to be so  the story absorbs and entertains with the brutal holds no prisoners violence not feeling gratuitous the central relationship being beautifully written and the despair and redemptions themes being surprisingly poignantoverall very good if understandably polarising 810 bethany cox,black_comedy
i first saw the dark comedythriller ib in our local multiplex back in april 2008 and i loved it immediately no wonder writerdirector martin mcdonaghs screenplay went on to be nominated for an oscar and costar colin farrell won a golden globe award for best actor in a comedymusical when mcdonaghs short film six shooter starring brendan gleeson won the 2005 oscar for best live action short film i was already familiar with his plays including the 2005 broadway hit the pillowman with our familys household fave jeff goldblum so i looked forward to seeing gleeson work with mcdonagh again in ib i wasnt disappointed mcdonaghs quirky funny soulsearching dialogue is a joy to hear its chock full of profanity but the delivery renders it more comical than offensive the filmmakers even spoof the adult language in one of the dvds bonus features a montage of every time the word f is used in ibgleeson and farrell make a great seriocomic team as ken and ray two irish hit men who have suspenseful and surreal adventures hiding out in belgium in the magnificent city of bruges after their latest job goes horribly heartbreakingly wrong theyre the ultimate oddcouple tourists as they await further instructions from their boss with ken enjoying the sightseeing and the swans as ray spews forth befuddled unfavorable hilariously unpc opinions of just about everything and everyone he encounters except a pretty flemish production assistant clemence poesy of 127 hours whos as full of surprises as our undercover assassins farrell gives one of his very best performances blending laughoutloud comedy and guiltridden heartache beautifully my favorite running gag was rays childlike fascination with dwarfs and his oafish but wellmeant concern for cokehead dwarf actor jimmy jordan prentice whos in the fairytalelike city to appear in a dream sequence in a local indie arthouse flick as harry the boys crime boss ralph fiennes does a terrific job channeling sir ben kingsley as the terrifying don in sexy beast i assure you thats a compliment ib mixes suspense melancholia and hilarity very well indeed along with the bank job ib was my favorite crime film of 2008 the dvds featurettes and deleted scenes are fun too including interviews a captioned boat tour of bruges and a deleted scene involving matt smith in his predoctor who days  and a machete the many deleted scenes are all quite entertaining im sure they were only cut so ib wouldnt be a 3hour epic ,black_comedy
beautifully shot with impeccable acting i watched this because i am enjoying farrell in true detective and i am high and have insomnia this movie is not predictable because every time you make an assumption you are wrong the imagery the filming the philosophies they speak of everything about this movie is perfect even the couple of far fetched scenes work wonders and are part of its central fairytell in purgatory theme i look forward to seeing what else the writerdirector has plans on releasing i hope he continues the brilliance he showcased here no matter what state of mind you are in or how you sleep or dont watch this film,black_comedy
if you havent seen this film then go and see it but please dont read on until you havei saw it last night on pay tv and how i wished id seen it on the big screen it has stayed with me all daylike the song in your head that wont go awayi guess from the look of it that it was shot on some species of digital camerai saw from the credits they used an arri but there were credits for delux and a neg cutter it would have made sense to have shot this on hd as a wet night in a city lit by practicals cries our for it the photography was wonderful not in that it delivered a slide show of gorgeous frames but that you felt you were there it wasnt there to show off but to drive the story along part of the narrativeyou could feel your warm top coat around you as you sat in the sidewalk caf you could taste the cold strong beer and the cool night air on your face mr mcdonah is a vivid talent and for a feature film dbutant shows an amazing sureness of touch of course he has already won an oscar for his short film obviously a good training ground ill light a candle for him that his next film is just as good but completely differentthen we will know a new star has risenoh that difficult second albumthe writing as in any film is the most important element and the bizarre strangely formal dialogue especially harrys was to hear screen writing at its electrifying bestthe samurailike code of honour of the killers just added to the grown up fairytale feel towne and tarantino on a good day as actors gleason and fiennes were as ever beyond criticismsimply faultlesseveryone who writes about colin farrell begins with the disclaimer that they are not a fan well i guess hes not the most likable of people but his performance in this was pure goldspectacular part dougal mcguire father ted and part stan laurel yet convincingly tough the brutal violence had a real tom and jerry slapstick to it and was perfectly judged as were the accompanying quotable linesthats for john lennon yer fokin yankee khont as he punches out the obnoxious fellow diner who despite sitting in the smoking section complains about their smokingwe have all met himif you havent then you are him once again the director has shown himself true officer material to get such a wonderful performance from a difficult but gifted actorok colin today youre going to karatechop a dwarf i think there was a nod to living in oblivion therelike the birds this movie sets out as a comedy but ends in a glimpse of hellthere is a real medieval catholic perception of sin guilt and retribution running through this like the words in a stick of rock  to quote graham greene another obvious influencelike the final journey to hell as portrayed by heronimous boschthis film too is a haunting disturbing dazzling work of of art,black_comedy
first off id like to mention that this is a black comedy its meant to be funny in a morbid way also this is not a movie that should be seen for those with a faint heart as is suggested by the 18a rating in canada at least no idea for other countriesmoving on i have to say that this was a great movie much better than i anticipated and i was already ready for something fantastic the scenery and music are really amazing especially as a balance to the extremely foul and crude language that are rampant though that might put some people off it adds to the hilarity of the situation the contrast between this beautiful and melancholic music and scenery and the dialog that goes on between the two main charactersthere is of course a great deal of violence but that is to be expected of a movie about hit men the fact that everything took place makes it all the more funny especially with all the jokes that are made about both the town and belgium in generalthere is much more that i can say but i think that the film should speak for itself go watch it please do keep in mind though that this is not a slapstick comedy nor a sitcom as generally perceived a lot of it is laughing at the absurdity of what is happening and the dialog which is witty and great once again go watch the movie you wont regret it,black_comedy
went to see it for the setting loved it for the dialogue wished it had just gone a bit furtheris a dark comedy set in the beautiful medieval town of bruges belgium featuring an irish duo of hit men who have been ordered by their boss to hide out there after a highprofile job in london went sour their instructions are to keep a low profile sightsee and generally avoid trouble until further noticebut all is not as it seemsthe dialogue between gleeson and farrell is witty delivered with perfect comic timing zany and a joy to watch farrell and the charming clmence posy also have great chemistry and are fun to watch on screen the humour is designed to make viewers uncomfortable and succeeds remarkably on this count if youre looking for political correctness you wont find it here what you will find are jabs at americans tourists gays blacks whites fat people and oh yeah midgets as this odd assortment of characters mixes and mingles in the streets of bruges the tension buildsand theres just enough of a psychological dark edge to keep things interesting this is a comedy yes but its by no means light and fluffy this movie has been compared to the big hit or the whole nine yards but in fact its much much darker and in my opinion that makes it bettershot entirely on location the backdrop is of course stunning i originally went to see this knowing absolutely nothing about it other than the title simply because having visited bruges i couldnt resist an opportunity to see it on the big screen filmed in the wintertime and largely at night bruges itself is one of the stars of the movie like the other characters it is not portrayed as light airy innocent or picturesque the way it is in real life instead its more haunting quality is captured elegantly on film with a heavy mist giving the town a sort of eerie dreamlike qualityso much of this movie was just right and i highly recommend it to people who like twisted humour and arent easily offendedi have two issues with this film however the first is the score the music is completely wrong for this movie giving it a feel that doesnt work at all with the dark comedy tone the melancholy slow stirring music wouldve worked nicely with a drama or a psychological period piece but just seems out of place herethe second issue is with the ending nope i wont give it away suffice to say i thought it was wrong wrong wrong all wrong almost as though the author couldnt figure out what to do next or how to end this thingbut overall i really enjoyed it was wickedly funny daringly different and fantastically nonpc and the shots of bruges are wonderful despite what the main characters say about the place bruges is really quite wonderful i suggest seeing both the movie and the city,black_comedy
after watching the film for the third time i have just read through a number of the comments posted by others here yes the struggle with guilt is identified and the great acting especially farrell and the dark comedy but has no one else seen an allegory in the film early on in the film ray  ken view a painting in a museum and discuss that it represents purgatory the ending takes place in a film shoot ofpurgatory principles guilt hellprisonor the light abovei just hope that those who see it as merely an addition to the pulp fiction genre will hear the depth of the film if only on a subconscious leveland the soundtrack is perfect,black_comedy
to put it succinctly was the best film that i saw in 2007 i loved every minute of it from the expletives in the opening scene to the shockingly crazy ending colin farrell plays a hitman recruited by brendan gleeson to work for ralph fiennes when farrell botches his first job fiennes sends both him and gleeson to bruges belgium to get them away from londoncolin farrell was disastrous in alexander largely because the film was a catastrophe so watching him in was a real surprise he is excellent he fits the character so well the mannerisms emotions everything his interactions with gleeson during their escapades throughout the medieval town of bruges are examples of perfect cinematography excellent scripts and superb sounds the score complements the film in every way fitting both the scenery and the filmhowever if you are easily offended or unable to deal with violent scenes you probably do not want to watch this film violence coarse language and other antisocial tendencies are pervasive throughout the film as they form the core of the movie i know of only two people that would not like this film in fact i plan to show this to my mum and im sure shell love it,black_comedy
i am upset to see this film not get enough recognition with the acting and directing at top notch film goers should have payed more attention toward it martin m directed this film in 13 days and has made a little masterpiece colin farrell and brenden gleason gave the performances of their lives and ralph finnes showed once again that he can act in any genre the violence was very graphic which is fine by me and the language was offensive and very funny this black comedy is a gem and should be seen by anybody over 18 even though i am 15  i hope this film is recognized for what it truly is a story of an undying friendship this film is in my illustrious top 5 and will stay there for as long as i live,black_comedy
if the dark knight is the film with the biggest most grandiose hype surrounding it this year then would be the biggest sneaky surprise not only is the writing as snappy and perfectly honed as any other film big or small this year but boasts career high performances from the entirety of its cast dark comedies are hard to master and this is certainly the most worthwhile i have seen since lethal weapon creator shane blacks kiss kiss bang bang especially with far lesser attempts such as war inc fouling up the pondbruges the capital of west flanders in belgium pronounced broojiz serves as the quirky setting for second time director martin mcdonagh and the cinematography and art direction immerses the viewer into this abstract setting evokes a somewhat dreamlike carriage which is efficiently echoed by journey of the characters this beguiling fable follows two hit men the distraught and emotionally fragile ray colin farrell and the gentle fatherly ken brendan gleeson sent by their irritable and emotionally erratic employer harry ralph fiennes to bruges to fulfill a hit complicating the situation is rays unstable mental state which was shaken on an earlier job when a young boy was caught in the crossfire and which has left quite suicidal the surreal surroundings of bruges leave ray wanting but thrills ken with its gothic storybook refinement things become even more phantasmal during the meeting of a movie star dwarf played by jordan prentice and with the development of an unlikely relationship between ray and a local girl chloe clmence posy these circumstances sway the line between a dreamworld and the bleak reality of the duos proffesions but never to the extent where the film could be considered a physiological bindbender by any meanscolin farrell has always been a solid actor but needs to rethink his agent as his roles carry from routine action flicks which leave him emotionally grounded to art house flops that become far to precious and quirky for their own good farrell gives the performance of his career flawlessly blurring the line between a coy smartaleck and tragic silhouette gleeson is equally sensational again showing like never before his acting chops i cannot say that ralph fiennes gives his best here as that distinction belongs with his astounding portrayal of amon goeth in schindlers list but it is certainly his most accomplished since then posy is delightful and complex for her small role and prentice proves that an actor of his stature does not have to be typecast in meaningless rolesas amazing as the ensemble cast is kudos are justly due to mcdonough whose writing chops provide the drole and solid foundation for the performances this effort is simultaneously hilarious tragic and mystical and the three blend seamlessly unlike other films cut from the same cloth never lets its quirkiness take the story setting and characters hostage it is involving and endearing with countless meaningful undercurrents and as a whole this film demands repeat viewings an order i am highly pleased to fill there is also some gunplay and bloodshed for those who find themselves hardpressed to sit through a film completely devoid of a scuffle or two really takes a bit of everything and perhaps that is best suited to the continually surreal surroundings that we find the two immersed in and although risking a lot with such a direction it never seems scattershot or incoherent and after this infinitely satisfying adventure was the only place i wanted to beview all my reviews at simon says movie reviews wwwsimonsaysmoviesblogspotcom,black_comedy
this is exactly my sort of film if you like edgy minimalist crime capers this is your sort of film too if you liked the limey andor the matador i think youll like this one really i thought id like this one but didnt expect it to be as satisfying as it wascolin farrell really should be considered for an oscar for this performance he plays ray a troubled hitman who is struggling to come to terms with the aftermath of a hit gone wrong while some commenters have noted rays erratic behavior few have mentioned his quite profound crisis of conscience some might say he has no conscience but that is undercut by the moral code to which the hit men in this film adhere this one act has thrown him completely offcourse and he acts out in antisocial and very funny ways he insults other tourists he is excessively irritated by minor things he is completely disinterested in sightseeing in the beautiful medieval city its in belgium where he and and his laidback accomplice ken the ever professional brendan gleeson have been sent with instructions to lay low until they get their next word from their boss harry ralph fiennes playing a character whose job and demeanor seem very similar to those of ben kingsley in sexy beast that said fiennes makes this role his own with his passion and intelligencedirector martin mcdonagh as mentioned has a flare for capturing the ultimately sad human essence of hit men he does not glamorize them but captures them at their most mundane the laughs seem all the funnier for their very universality that said he never loses sight of the fact that this story is really about hit men attempting to come to terms with what they have done it lends the story a sobering undertone which ensures the movie will stay with you for a long time farrell is absolutely at the top of his game fiennes is like ben kingsley in sexy beast scarily psychotic and brendan gleeson is like others have said in comments the moral center of the film the conclusion is satisfying and appropriate and i cannot wait to see what mcdonagh does next,black_comedy
if id grown up on a farm and was retarded bruges might impress me but i didnt so it doesnt ive never grown up certainly not on a farm and as for the other criterion it is best left to others to judge but i was impressed by the sights of the belgian town itself would make an attractive documentary and they serve as a perfect counterpoint to the sardonic humor that emanates from the characters from beginning to end of this filmwhen the frozen mist appears over the town it becomes a fairy tale landscape well a fairy tale that includes hit men in repose a girl on a film crew who sells a pharmacopoeia of drugs when not shilling for a skinhead who shoots blanks figuratively and literally fat americans boorish canadians rumors of a midget  excuse me  dwarf race war very funny and very dark casual conversations a horror in flashback and one of the bloodiest and most ethical shootouts to ever conclude a moviecolin farrell apparently has the current franchise on guiltridden semiclueless and almost entirely heedless characters who inadvertently plague their partners given his recent showing in woody allens cassandras dream in the previous film his character treads water barely keeping his guilt afloat in the pervasive gloom while he swims with it on his back through dark and unforced humor and regret brendan gleason provides a sturdy framework for the plot and the revelation of character clearly it is one of his best performances  a hitman with the face and fidelity of an old knight errant ralph fiennes also sets the perfect tone as the criminal nobleman to whom farrell and gleason both owe allegiance and must confront with reluctant defiance the erstwhile fleur delacour of harry potter and the goblet of fire clmence posy plays the drug dealermugger assistant with a sort of heart of gold and no for once thats not peter dinklage the hardest working little person in movies its jordan prentice this appears to be directorwriters martin mcdonaghs fulllength feature debut kudos,black_comedy
hilarious yet emotionally captivating bravo not at all what id imagine it to be,black_comedy
i dont need to repeat anything about the plot line since you have already read it or should have in any event i found this film to be a wonderful diversion what we soon learn is that the two hit men are completely unsuited to the job they are complex morally conflicted and emotional while their employer is a cynical psychopath having some time off with these two in the belgian city of bruges during christmas allows us to move about the old city on a sight seeing tour punctuated with serendipitous or chaotic encounters with other people and interactions between the two leads along with the christmas lights there is some violence but it is integral to the black comedy aspect of the film some of the violence is quite comicalthe addition of a film in production within this film adds another level two of the supporting characters come out of that inner film in a certain way providing a connection between waking and dreaming bit parts played by people in fantastic costumes add to the magic of what might otherwise be a purely dark sceneall the characters are very carefully crafted as another review stated this is in part a character study it is also designed to be very entertaining which it is i enjoyed it immensely a bit slow moving at times but this is a european film which holds the value of the stage very high yet it does not appear staged it puts you right there the direction the camera work and the acting all work together to give a real experience,black_comedy
this is one of those awesome films that a viewer will either love or hatethere is no inbetweenif you love it you must have a twisted wicked sense of humor an open mind enough to truly appreciate wellwritten intelligent dialogue and an imagination that will go along wa plot that looks like it is two jigsaw puzzles mixed togetheruntil it all comes together brilliantly in the last 30 minutes add in a performance from colin farrell that is so different from the arrogant atype character he usually playshis dumb character is actually funny in this oneat the industry screening here in la several older types walked out earlymaybe because of the liberal use of the fwordbut the majority stayed to debate the ending and why it had to end the way it didfor those who hated it youre too stupid to understand an intelligent thoughtprovoking film when you see one,black_comedy
this is a hard movie to classify let alone review where do you start it is humorous but essentially it is a tragedy it is unashamedly politically incorrect but it does so indiscriminately the central characters are really reprehensible in their actions  views and hardly distinguishable from the bad guys wow  just like in real lifethe scenes of bruges are beautifully shot the script is clever and funny and the acting first rate the whole movie is a work of art it became my favourite movie from the first viewing but i left it nearly a year before reviewing it as i thought my enthusiasm may subside it has not i have given this film 1010 there is a wonderfully warm paternal relationship between ken brendan gleeson  ray colin farrell both characters are beautifully written with depth and wit the background story unfolds gently without any fanfares that would insult the viewer there are several very interesting characters floating around bruges with ray  ken many of whom have good lines and memorable presence in the film tourists drug dealers a dwarf and a ticket seller all with their part to play and who play it well the movie changes tempo in the final half hour becoming more action orientated and for me this is the weakest part but the ending itself is perfect for the film it has ambiguity which is something i normally hate but a happy ending would be out of the question in this story and who the hell wants to see a sad one,black_comedy
playwrite martin mcdonagh directs his feature film debut the plot colin farrell and brendan gleeson play ray and ken two irish hit men ray is a lovable young man and ken is his paternal superior the duo have just completed a job in london but things didnt go well ray accidentally shot a childguiltridden ray spends the rest of the film in a suicidal daze ken sympathises with the guy and the duo have a number of touching conversations these are the two most touchyfeely assassins since john cusack in grosse point blankmcdonaghs plot later takes focus when the duos crime boss arranges for ken and ray to travel to bruges a small town in northern belgium ken views this as a vacation an opportunity to explore the historical city but ray hates the place he wants to die or perhaps hook up with pretty local girlsmcdonagh lays the symbolism on thick during the films first 40 minutes bruges is portrayed as purgatory a transition point between earth and judgement with hieronymus bosch paintings ominous dialogue and much talk of sins needing be repaid several noir elements are also set up bottles midgets stairs prostitutes weight fat people lists rivers guns all of which come into play during mcdonaghs final act here his characters increasingly find themselves buffeted by not only their warrior code but noir fatemidway into the film ken receives a message from his boss his new mission is to kill his partner ray a longstanding clich in assassin movies see even the recent the american ken refuses and his boss grows furious the film then ends with your typical final act shootout though the script is smart enough to subvert expectations at times mcdonaghand has enough wit to mock genre conventions but isnt strong enough to create his own rules7910  cant compete with john cusacks grosse point blank both films feature neurotic assassins and attempt to mix action with humour but grosse point trumps in virtually every category its funnier wittier has more action and its characters are ultimately more touching is neither serious enough to be a major dramatic work nor funny enough to be a memorable comedyworth one viewing,black_comedy
its rare to find a film that can go from hilarious comedy to dark violence and genuine emotion without compromising either the humour or the drama but this one does it time and againthe cast are excellent gleeson is good as the sensible adult figure while farrell is brilliant as the comic and immature lead farrell shows excellent comic timing and gets most of the best lines the supporting cast are all good everyone is believablethe humour is often very politically incorrect but never in a nasty way the dialogue is superb and there are some great set pieces and unexpected comic twists to catch you by surprise and make you laugh out loudthe dramatic side handles a very dark and emotional subject very deftly with believable switches from humour to sadness and the leads really earn there money by pulling those switches off seamlesslythere is a lot of action and violence especially towards the end and this throws in ideas that i had never seen used beforeif you liked the film intermission youll definitely like this but this has more and better jokes and the plot is far more interestingive rarely left a cinema feeling i got as much value for my money as i did with this film,black_comedy
after a contract killing goes disastrously wrong two hit men are told by their boss the foulmouthed harry to hide out so they head for bruges even though they have no idea why they have been sent there or even where bruges is its in belgium the two hit men are forced to come to terms with their own inner demons and they are doomed to face the consequences of their actionsit is easy to spot that martin mcdonagh the writer and director of is heavily influenced by quentin tarantino in fact i would go so far as to say that this is the type of movie tarantino would have made had he been born in dublin and not knoxville tennessee every tarantino trademark from the mexican standoff to the retrospective storytelling is brilliantly executed in this film in addition the use of piquant and pervading dialogue to build mcdonaghs characters and drive the narrative is also superbly executed tarantino would be proud however this film is not just another quentin tarantino knockoff by a british director apart from the obvious nods to tarantino there are other elements that make this an interesting and distinctly entertaining film the film is shot on location a small picturesque town in belgium of which most people probably have never heard bruges is portrayed as a town steeped in history and religious lore and despite farrells character ray saying it is a se at every possible opportunity bruges looks quite exquisite on the big screen if it is to be the last place you see before you die it is definitely a beautiful place to goanother key ingredient of this exemplary film is the tour de force performances by the three leads and supporting cast colin farrell in my opinion has never really lived up to his early promise farrell has had more misses than hits but his performance in shows that he has impeccable comic timing and can also deliver a performance that is at the same time both subtle and poignant gleason is superb as usual as the older and wiser hitman who cannot bring himself to punish farrells character for his gruesome mistake and finally ralph fiennes drops the repressed upperclassenglishman guise that he usually adopts and plays the frenetic foulmouthed gangster with gustodoes get very dark at times for a film that is billed as a comedy thus some viewers will be put off but i believe its propensity to shock you one minute and make you laugh the next is one of the films strongest qualities although the writerdirector was born in london it is obvious that there are many strong irish influences in his life and these irish influences are very evident in his writingis a darkly comic film with lashings of catholic guilt throughout its strength lies in its outstanding characterisations and its ultrasharp dialogue is an example of screen writing at its finest and the film is destined to become a classic even better still it is a firstrate advertisement for the city of bruges and after watching the film i know i want to go there,black_comedy
what a great film both gritty and beautiful superbly acted with a taught script there are predictable parts but they are often only foreshadowed by a few minutes it is one of those great dark crime comedies that the brits are so good ata little lighter than sexy beast a little darker than snatch but with a dreamlike quality that shows just a touch of influence from felini really fun flick in a way the characters are a bit clichdespecially ralph fienes gangster but thats no big deal i thought the inclusion of jimmy the racist dwarf was a stroke of brilliance and the tight way he is woven into the script shows some real skill go see this film,black_comedy
ray colin farrell  ken brendan gleeson are two irish hit men who are sent to lie low in the beautiful city of bruges by their gangster boss harry waters ralph fiennes as they wait for instruction from harry the pair start to address many things that are troubling them with one pressing matter particularly relevant to their lives post the bruges visitwritten and directed by martin mcdonagh a man more known for his play writing abilities is a rare old animal indeed not only is it a winner in the very wobbly subgenre that encompasses the british gangster movie its also a hugely funny and tasteless button pusher to boot from the outset the film sets itself up to not be to everybodys cup of tea as colin farrell and brendan gleeson exchange expletive after expletive whilst surrounded by the considerable beauty of bruges its obvious this is not going to be a normal movie throw in drug abuse prostitution and a racist dwarf well you can understand why the film is seen as unpalatable to someyet still be digestible brilliance to others what is for sure is that those who havent seen it really should do so for it may just become one of your favourite movies yes it really does deserve the chance to pull you on boardby definition its an ultimate black comedy but in amongst the laughs and there are many lies a potent and affecting human drama involving love guilt morals and redemption with the trick pulled by mcdonagh being that of having every character in the piece dislikable yet easy to be on side with dont be surprised if you find yourself welling up with emotion during some of the more critical scenes for the screenplay bafta award winning and the performances of farrell golden globe award best actor  gleeson are razor sharp and very involving even fiennes spiv gangster boss is shown to be a ruthless sweary anger merchant yet still capable of apology and genuinely respective of good principals if that sounds odd then good because its an odd and strange little movie i mean the love interest comes in the form of pretty clmence posy a criminal femme fatale type here but once fleur delacour in harry potter  the goblet of fire while canadian dwarf actor jordan prentice is more well known for playing howard the duck each of them serving genuine purpose both for the funny side of the story and for the more humanistic elements that unravel as we hurtle towards to the coup de grce a like finalea barbed wire black comedy led by a towering performance from farrell just like him you should laugh cry and swear to your hearts content 910,black_comedy
i find it incredible how colin farrell uses expressions instead of words to say something in particular you see him revert to a child working out how he can find some reason to be allowed to leave the hotel room he doesnt say a word but you can tell exactly what he is thinkingthere are other scenes for example when he decides to accept the situation he is in at the moment and you can actually read his thoughts with no words being spokenin the scene when the dwarf fails to even notice him you can see disappointment resolution and finally acceptance and dismissal of the situation,black_comedy
pick some excellent actors add a superb and unpredictable plot mix in some believable dialogue and odd yet completely realistic situations and then set almost the entire film in a haunting yet mesmerising location most of us have never been to some never even heard ofthe film in brujes is many things it is extremely endearing gory violent funny tender but most of all it is a compellingly human film it charts a handful of days in the lives of two hired killers after a job in london goes wrong and they are sent to cool off and lay low in a rather unexpected place brujes belgiumthe reason they are sent there becomes apparent once we have already been drawn well into the plot and have developed empathy for the main characters which makes everything that happens to them in the final act all the more resonantwithout spoiling it as i believe this film is one of the least predictable ones i have seen in years the reason they are sent to this littleknown place in cinema at least partly involves the fact that brujes is like a fairy tale citysince i dearly treasure the feeling of going to the cinema and being pleasantly surprised throughout the length of a film both by its quality acting and original plot i shall simply tell you that i was amused and laughed throughout i felt pity i felt pain i felt hope i feltand i now feel i want to see this city because both it and this film have something of a fairytale about them honestly miss this gem at your peril,black_comedy
from what i had heard about this movie it could have been like apocalypse now or it could have been another one of those movies which are spoofed in the likes of pulp fiction but it wasnt i dont know whether its an adapted screenplay or an original one still this is such a movie that i wont mind even if the novel is written for the movie a classy cinematography gothic photography amazing screenplay the most unpredictable one very mature acting by a superb starcast enough humor to keep me amused with a wide smile on my face and the core of it all the theme or drama never being misplaced in this simple looking complex film the director martin mcdonaugh is a winner already i would certainly not compare it to anything that has been done before but would go as far to say it a benchmark for the movies to come a complete package of everything that is required for a blockbuster but with a little difference because it is,black_comedy
where to begin on this film is simply the most original films that i have seen in a long while martin mcdonagh has written a hilarious dark comedic adventure the story is very intriguing but the characters are shear genius and they are improved with the perfect castmany people will pass this up on these bases ive never heard of it it is a british film and colin farrel is in iti am openly admitting that before i saw this film i did not care for colin farrel and i was not a fan of his acting he redeems himself in this role his deep and comedic portrayal of his character cannot be missed not to mention brendan gleesons astounding work and ralph fiennes doing one hell of a performance even the smaller characters are so very interestingthis film is a must see dont miss out on,black_comedy
martin mcdonagh a noted stage director  writer has fashioned this very originaldark comedy into one of the best films so far this yearnote on the script  the use of foul language normally i despise the excessive use of the f word in the script  the way these fine actors use them it seems natural  normalcolin farrell  brendan gleeson are 2 hit men hiding out in plain sight in the medieval city bruges belgium they are waiting to hear from there boss superbly enacted by ralph fiennes in fact all 3 actors could be nominated for acting honours at this years endi must also mention the following players for there outstanding workclemencie posey as a native lass of the cityshe is new  a breath of fresh air hopefully she will be in many more filmsalso jordan prentice just about steals the few scenes he is in he happens to be dwarf  has great talent  promise as an actorthe entire production is first ratenote bruges dates back to the 12 th century  most buildings are many hundreds of years old they seem very well preserved gee whiz here in the good ole usaif a building is 50 years old its torn down  we do nothing about itdue to the language  subject matter as well as some violence at the conclusion i do not recommend this for children also there are no cgi action scenes it is a film with great dialogue between the actors mainly between farrell  gleesondo not miss this film  it will be high on most best listsratings out of 4 98 points out of 100 imdb 10 out of 10,black_comedy
has a plot line that comfortably accommodates a number of seemingly incongruous elements as well as producing some neat twists its mixture of crime comedy and action is immediately appealing but as it develops its also enriched by the eccentricities of its characters and the sharp dialogue that brings them to life so effectively as an added bonus the action is set in the beautiful belgian city that provides the movie with its stunning backdrop as well as its title and the action is cleverly paced to accommodate both character development and the delivery of some entertaining action sequencesray colin farrell and ken brendan gleeson are a couple of irish hit men who are sent to bruges to escape the fallout from their last job which went very wrong when ray unintentionally killed a child all they know is that their stay could last up to two weeks and that they need to remain on standby to receive some further instructions from their crime boss harry ralph fiennes the two men are very different as ray is young excitable and a complete novice at his job whereas ken is older more experienced and has a much calmer disposition ken adjusts immediately to their predicament and takes the opportunity to enjoy some sightseeing but ray is completely unimpressed by his new surroundings and is impatient to leave again as soon as possible rays also consumed with guilt about what hes donerays attitude starts to soften however after he sees a film crew at work one night and becomes fascinated by a dwarf whos one of the main actors in a dream sequence that theyre filming to add further enjoyment he also meets chloe clemence poesy an attractive production assistant and makes a date with her their friendship soon becomes very eventful as their date ends with ray beating up an unpleasant couple who were sitting near them in a restaurant and discovering that chloe is actually a drug dealer whose sideline in the past has been to seduce tourists so that her exboyfriend eirik jeremie renier could rob themwhen ken eventually receives harrys telephone call hes surprised by the assignment that hes given and prepares to go ahead as instructed things dont go according to plan though and so harry feels compelled to travel to bruges himself and this leads to the storys surprising climax which proves to be deeply ironic wonderfully absurd and perfectly fitting for this very black comedyfor his directorial debut wellrespected playwright martin mcdonagh has come up with an exceptional story thats totally unpredictable and juxtaposes tragedy comedy remorse violence and pathos in ways that are quite original and unexpected his characters are extremely welldrawn and theres an innate quirkiness about the whole undertaking which makes the movie continuously stimulating and funny to watchcolin farrell and brendan gleeson are marvellous as the two hit men as they bring out their individual characteristics so vividly whilst also displaying through their banter how well they work together and function as friends ralph fiennes also makes a huge impact with his nicely overthetop portrayal of the scary sociopath harry,black_comedy
i was lucky enough to see this at a preview screening late last year in hatfield the galleria and also took part in a discussion group after the film not knowing what to expect before hand i left the cinema very satisfied it was certainly no waste of time farrell and gleeson were excellent as was fiennes the quirky dark humour was brilliant and both script and acting also i hope the full release doesnt lack the random spark it possessed at its preview i liked the film so much it has prompted me to post my 1st comment on here after a year or so i found a particular scene involving ray ken the dwarfmidget and some drugs and hookers very funny good ending too cant wait for the dvd highly recommended but not one for the whole family,black_comedy
was a huge disappointment especially considering the unending praise this movie has been drawing from critics and viewers alikei thought it was very false and contrivedthe movie centers on two professional hit men from ireland rationalising what they do for a living ie killing people for money by telling themselves that most of the people theyve killed werent very nice anyway so kinda had it comingonly got their comeuppance at the same time they do of course have very appropriate pangs of conscience about the few people they killed who may not have deserved it generally speaking i dont care for movies about contract killers grosse pointe blank being another example which depict their protagonists in a nave romanticised way yeah here are these two paid killers but dont be put off by what they do for a living theyre really quite friendly people so long as you dont end up on their hitlist in fact even if you do end up on their hitlist they are still going to be friendly to you although they are going to have to kill you but thats strictly business nothing personal there is a scene where one of them relates how he had to kill a man he wasnt paid to kill  the man just stood in his way trying to protect a relative who was on the assassins hitlist the scene turns into a mock argument about whether or not he shot the man in selfdefence with the two talking at cross points or rather colin farrells character pretending to be too obtuse to see the other guys point the scene is clearly meant to be hilarious i had no inclination to smileone thing i am really sick of in englishlanguage movies not only this one is all these continental european supporting characters with absolutely flawless english in this case colin farrells enormously annoying belgian love interest not only do they never make any mistakes they speak the language so brilliantly that they can hold their own in witty conversations with native speakers firing from a sparkling repartee that includes puns on english words that i assume wouldnt work in their own language how about making a movie for a change in which belgians germans italians etc speak english the way they really do ie badly of course no explanation is ever given why they speak english so well usually one of the nativespeaker characters just makes a stupid surprised face and says something like wow your english is really good and thats that on to the next punanother thing i am tired of is all these regular people with superhuman courage in the face of extreme danger in this case an extremely pregnant hotel owner who never wavers for a second as she stands in the way of an armed madman in defiance of the danger to her own life and that of her unborn baby right if there was anybody in the real world who would really act this way it wouldnt be courageous it would be plain stupidthere is one scene of such colossal absurdity i cant help but relate it a man is first shot in the leg then he hobbles down the winding stairs of a bell tower albeit propped up by another man to be fair then he gets shot into the throat or maybe shoulder then he drags himself back up the same winding staircase this time without the help of the other man then  once at the top  he drags himself onto the parapet of said bell tower to stand erect upon the parapet before hurling himself down there is a massive cloud of blood as he hits the ground i wont reveal what happens next lets just say the guy is of an impressive resiliencealmost as absurd is the ending which has the five leads all in the same place at the same time so the movie can conveniently deal with them one after the other until all emotional and outer conflicts are neatly resolved in a way that could only have been contrived by a director who comes from theateri am giving this movie a liberal 2 out of 10 stars the lowest rating i have given any movie since terry gilliams brothers grimm if you want to see an honest movie about a paid assassin watch the original day of the jackal that movie too centered on a man who killed for a living but unlike it never tries to coax the viewer into sympathising with its protagonist instead it deals with its subject matteroffactly hes a contract killer ruthless and despicable,black_comedy
is so relentlessly mindbogglingly bad its a miracle anyone was stupid enough to put up money for this piece of crap not only does it take forever to get going is it full of people doing completely unbelievable things does it completely fail to capture the spirit of bruges and its inhabitants and believe me theres plenty material there which can be parodied mercilessly if one is so inclined but worst of all it doesnt even know what it wants to say and its pretentious to boot the romance is ridiculous the midgetdwarf character is only there to function as the punchline of a sick jokeoid which really isnt funny or profound or thoughtprovoking none of the secondary characters are believable a pregnant woman ordering an armed gangster out of her hotel  without showing the slightest worry or fear for instance or someone piloting a boat down the canals of bruges who doesnt react when someone leaps onto his boat from a hotel window and bullets start flying theyre badly written and acted and except for the ticket seller none of them are flemish let alone from bruges theyre mainly french speakers  why for christs sake there are hundreds of flemish actors and a few dozen of them are actually quite good scriptwise the problem is that the jokey tone of many of the scenes completely clashes with the extreme tragedy of what colin farrells character has done and once this horror is revealed which makes it very hard to empathize with him at first absurd crime situations and cool bits of ultraviolence just dont fit with the overall tone this should be a story of either reprisal or redemption but it ends up being neither and both as the film progresses it becomes more and more ludicrous with the scene in the hotel between farrell fiennes and the landlady as the absolute nadir theres also some quite shocking gore a boy with his brains blown out a character with half his face blown offon the plus side farrell whom i really really hate normally is extremely good brendan gleeson also does a good job and ralph fiennes does his best with a very illconceived role and some of farrells rants and jokes are amusing but the weaknesses of the script and the weak acting of the rest of the cast make this an unalloyed disaster too bad mcdonagh didnt jump off the belfort instead of gleesons character then the world would have been spared this travesty of a film,black_comedy
the dvd version of this movie was advertised as a comedy maybe the movie should have been advertised as the existential exploration of the lives of english murderers in the early 21st century or as an inquiry into the meaninglessness of life exemplified by three men who commit brutal acts a comedy it is notthe movie showed the miserable and pointless lives of three hit men interspersed with ugly scenes of murder there were some lame jokes on bruges and belgium which did not get better by overuse the film was slow presenting an elegiac not a comedic tempo maybe some people find the display of the internal conflicts of hit men funny i found it  at least in this movie  repulsive and nauseating at the end of the movie i had a bad taste in my mouth that i wouldnt wish on anybodythe acting and the photography were good forget the rest,black_comedy
it gets 1 star for the lovely travelogue of bruges seeing a heironymous bosch and maybe another star for not having a happy endingthe dialogue was atrocious worst of all  it was uninteresting and not amusing i am even more horrified to learn that this was written by a playwright not some 15 year old watching too many tarantino films  thinking hes being hipironic by making fun of midgets swearing every 3 seconds  having his characters be amoral and unsympatheticthe characters were not only all uninteresting and unsympathetic they were all boring yes we get it theyre pathetic rays not very bright they have no other future theyre amoral most of the people are violent homophobic and racist but they feel a little bad when kids die there was no personal growth on any of their parts  a tiny bit of remorse maybe no sense of an attempt at redemption ray is literally confused about the concept when ken tries to spell it out for him kens sacrifice for ray came out of nowhere and made no sense he claims ray has a chance to change there is no indication from ray that he will redeem himself or change in the slightest there were no interestingnovel action bits or shooting nearly every twist was obvious and foreseeable what the instructions would be what ken was doing in the park most of the ending i enjoy most of ralplh fiennes movies other than maid in manhattan but his role here was a waste of time unstable evil guy absolutely nothing new or even really fleshed outit was painful and an utter waste of my time it was derivative and pointless it didnt entertain me it didnt make me think it didnt challenge me it didnt show me anything new other than scenery of bruges it didnt amuse me i chuckled maybe twiceif you want a good european locale  action film with character development and clever dialogue watch hot fuzz instead if you want a quirky film about a hitman thinking about his job  falling in love rent grosse point blank,black_comedy
there is something to admire about its a black comedy which is the hardest genre to make as it comes with all possible pitfalls of both humor and drama its ambitious in themes and symbolism the script makes an ingenious use of setups and payoffs every element or character introduced in the first half has a relevant consequence in the second  a sort of chekhovs armoryand its premise is intriguing killers ray farrell and ken gleeson hide after a botched assassination waiting for further instructions by their boss harry fiennes ray is fuming with boredom and irritation older pensive ken enjoys the atmosphere of the enchanting medieval town  until harry orders him to kill raywriting in this movie has something of a cult following humor is subjective but i found it hitandmiss see the problem isnt the amount of jokes about gays blacks yankees and dwarfs the latter turned into a painful running gag tarantino for one thrives on this politically incorrect stuff  except he is actually funny has a point to make and a gift with words this script doesnt display smug cynicism is mistaken for humor we are supposed to laugh because a man child is obsessed with midgets you can wax philosophical portray bruges as a sort of purgatory fill the movie with imagery straight from bosch but after the fourth dwarf joke your lofty ambitions scrape against your facile humor  it wasnt that funny even the first time mcdonagh see a confrontation between ray and harry when a pregnant woman angrily stops the armed men waving guns in her hotel and when they agree to go kill each other outside quips you people are crazy this isnt deep its a sketch confront it with another aborted mexican standoff  the one at the end of pulp fiction which had humor tension and the affecting musings of a man rethinking his liferay who has the central arc is unbelievable a killer who acts like a goofy 10yearsold and switches between moping for his hatred of bruges pursuing a local girl clmence posy and feeling devastated for accidentally shooting a kid thats not a character its a coat rack for a writers unused ideas more coherent and interesting is gleesons melancholic ken for the definitive black comedy about antiheroes dealing with honor karma and atonement watch pulp fiction for more lighthearted crime comedies good picks are guy ritchies snatch and shane blacks kiss kiss bang bang  and for a straightup comedy about neurotic killers richard armitages grosse pointe blankwhats odd is mcdonaghs following and better movie seven psychopaths is the opposite of this  a paperthin premise but a script which is actually amusing5510,black_comedy
i decided to see it because of all the good buzz it got from here a surprisingly original and brilliant film has a very strong screenplay full of great dialogue unpredictable turns and very original characters the performances from the whole cast is great but colin farrell is the central performance here i never knew farrell had the acting ability he demonstrated here his performance at times he is funny at times his performance centralizes over all the drama all the twists his accent his expressions a perfect performance and he certainly deserves an oscar nomination i happen to think it is one of the best male performances of the decade the film plays out soft and quiet it certainly is a lifelearning experience in a way the film takes us on this mans journey his journey with his partner and his journey into the world of hit men and the film makes something new it makes this world a sort of livelier place to be a sort of warm place but only at the right times the film is beautifully shot and it makes its points about the city bruges the cinematography is just gorgeous as well as the haunting music score that is manages to make every scene filled with more passion and emotionis very memorable because it does things differently it is not just a crime film it is not just a comedy it stands in the middle it really absorbs you because of the developed characters because of their situations because of what they go through because of the lessons they each learn and the lessons we learn with them is very human at its core and that is what it makes it stand out one of the best films of the year and one of the best examples of dark humor mix,black_comedy
loved itralph feinnes was great as always he is always such a good villain i love his bad guys colin farrel proved that he is great actor first with cassandras dream and now thisvery beautiful setting i love bruges i agree that it is one of the most peaceful places which is why it was a good choice for the location at times movie is just hilarious other times very sweet and touching and many pearls of wisdom if you really look into ittherefore i highly recommend for everyone to watch it i promise you will not regret it,black_comedy
hit men ray and ken have been sent to bruges to lay low for a while and await a call from their criminal boss harry they are meant to stay near the phone in the evening and are free to sightsee during the day but ray is less than impressed with his surroundings even in ken is soaking it all in while they await further instructions the two talk over things travel round the city get involved with some of the cast and crew making a film and generally fail to stay out of trouble or maintain a low profilewas sold as a hilarious comedy and this in combination with the names involved made me want to check it out it was missold but this is not to say that the film still wasnt pretty good it is occasionally laughoutloud funny but it is only occasionally and mostly the tone is very black with humour coming laced with violence on the flip of this approach though the film does still have a plot where the characters are in danger and it does still expect to pack a narrative and emotional punch both sides are ok but they do not work as well together as i would have liked when it is funny the film is brilliant with great lines juxtapositioning with the often violent situations they are in and this darkly comic stuff really appealed to me but the downside is that it does make it harder to suddenly launch into a more dramatic film where we really need to feel the danger this is difficult given we have just watched danger being dealt with in a comic and offhand way so my heart was not really in it in the later stages of the filmwhen the violence is handled with humour it doesnt bother me much but the gore and the impact of the violence is pretty harshly depicted which again makes the film a little hard to enjoy in the way i was in the first half of the movie really it needed to go one way or the other for definite so that there was an overall direction for the film because as it is it does feel like two different approaches with a reasonable blend in the middle the cast make it work though and you can see from their performances that they know they are the whole show here farrell impressed me with his comedy abilities and although he did remind me of father dougal at times he is really good here getting laughs and being able to deliver sudden brutality gleeson is equally good and the film is great when the two of them are allowed to play off one another fiennes helps the latter stages of the film work because his performance is strong  injecting dark energy into the film just when it needed something to carry it across the end reuten and prentice are ok but are very much secondary to the main threeoverall is not a brilliant or hilarious film but it does more or less work and entertain throughout the darker it gets the less it works and the ending is not as strong as the first half of the film but mostly the darkly comic and brutal material does work thanks to the really good playing from the three main actors while bruges itself provides a picturesque background come to it with low expectations and it will probably charm and engage you but it is not quite as good as some would have you believe,black_comedy
this is a terrific movie and the best ive seen this year anyone reading the boards will be aware of the storyline but will be unappreciative of the way it develops and its twists and turns martin mcdonagh has given us a film of multilayers which hits the right spot every time lets hope theres more great work to come from this highly talented director  playwright as for the performances well colin farrells is absolutely top notch for an actor whose work so far has seen highs and lows this is a notable high point his portrayal of ray is absolutely first class and he simply displays a quite amazing range of acting ability in this film the rest of the leads especially brendan gleeson and ralph fiennes provide superlative support this is a cinematic experience that should not be missed,black_comedy
martin mcdonagh in his first feature film has created one hell of an introduction the movie is not complex at first as two hit men are sent to bruges to wait for their orders after a hit goes terribly wrong bruges is in belgium by the way its a beautiful medieval city that lifts off the screen with gorgeous cinematography its hard to imagine a city so aesthetically pleasing with its towers canals and scenery that most would cherish one of the hit men is ray colin farrell and the other is ken brenden gleeson ray finds bruges to be old and boring while ken admires the architecture with wondrous eyes as they wait for their orders we have a lot of comedic banter with a setting quentin tarantino could write dialogue for days with it takes about twenty minutes into the film when the action and the plot start to pull all the strings together with a hit in a church of all places this is rays first hit the scene starts through a flashback with ray confessing to a murder that will take place in the not so distant feature he tells the priest ive murdered someone the priest asks who did you murder ray responds with you father as the bullets start to fly a life is taken more importantly an innocent life  a young boys life the boy is on his knees as he just finished writing his confession for all the bad things he didthis sets into place a string of events involving characters recognizing their own absurdity in certain situations they call them principles the humor is dark and extremely effective mostly coming from ray at some point in the film i was laughing so hard i missed the next lines it truly is laughoutloud funny farrell is perfect with his childish delivery batting eyebrows and high pitched squeaking sounds to emphasize certain words farrell does an excellent job as and makes you feel for his characters pain immensely as he agonizes over the little boys death both of these actors work exceptionally well off one another and both give heart felt performances do hit men such as these have moral boundaries do they cross them do they stand by their word and more importantly do they do what they say they would do when the gun is put to their own head ethics would never come into play with hit men in most films but these men have boundaries and their word means something to them henry ralph fiennes is the leader of these two hit men and he sent both to bruges to wait for his orders after the tragic hit in the church for the first 23 of the film we only hear him over the phone and he brings dark humor into the picture as well the writing is fantastic as certain characters constantly repeat themselves and say the same thing multiple times it sounds musical and so rhythmic with the delivery and the repetition fiennes is terrific he and ken have a couple of great scenes together in the final act its acting at its finest the direction overall is extremely well done after the film settles in it takes off and most of that is due in large part by the gorgeous cinematography and the great score lifting the film to the heights that it will stay at for the rest of the film as the film progresses it gets better and better and better youll find yourself gradually becoming more and more involved with the outcome of the characters is a dark and funny film thats engaging till the end with an engrossing plot and characters the best movie of 2008,black_comedy
is an ambitious but ultimately failed attempt to deliver some sort of existential fable the internal moral conflicts of professional assassins werent amusing in any way or intelligently presented this subject matter would have any movie director walking on very thin ice in order to pull it off the director must display tact the writer must provide smart dialogue and strong character development and the actors should skate gracefully none of those qualities are to be found herethe sickening violence relentless verbal assault and cringeinducing jokes insults are not only in very poor taste but a pathetic display of mediocrity add some offensive moral considerations a dwarfs life is apparently less valuable than a childs life among others to the variety of cheap tricks to stir some controversy and youve got a perfect exploitation flick i realize the subject matter isnt exactly fairytale but that aggressive vulgarity distracted from everything else in what bizarro world does that make for brilliant writing is just one really bad in a painful unfunny way film that desperately wants to be artsy its supposed to be a darkly humorous and insightful take on the human condition but instead it only disgusts theres no wit no finesse no spark in this movie ralph fiennes and colin farrell two fine actors are surprisingly ineffective here as a result of an atrocious script the raving reviews are stupefying too bad about bruges its a city too beautiful to be associated with this pseudointellectual trash,black_comedy
atrocious filmmaking two morons that by the end were meant to find adorable arrive for some sinister mission what follows is basically a hate filled diatribe humiliating gay men shock horror dwarfs and women theres no sophistication in the supposedly brilliant writing its the kind of lousy movie that seems to have been inspired by rednecks and writing on toilet walls in pubsreading some of the reviews of this film is mind boggling most harp on and on about farrells redemption but given that this particular element in the script is so utterly unconvincing is this what mcdonaugh considers irony and simply used as a device to validate farrells rampant homophobia and misogynythe result is sickening not illuminatingyes bruges looks wonderful but who cares when youre watching offensive rubbish of this nature painful,black_comedy
the movie starts with ordinary irish accent and classical irish crime plot but after few minutes you can feel the difference then normal thanks to camera angels and music the movie always tries to relax you and concenterate you to focus on scenes final words worth to watch even for second time,black_comedy
this film can be a hit or miss for people and i can understand why with it being a dark comedy however for me i absolutely love it its just on the verge of one of my all time top favorited and thats why i gave it a 9 its hilarious while still sticking to its dark plot creating moments of great acting and human emotion this is also a movie you can watch multiple times and still enjoy,black_comedy
cant quite put a finger on it but theres something about the irish that knits humor pathos and grit together like few others can jim sheridan danny boyle terry loane and kenneth branaugh do it exceedingly well this offering by martin mcdonagh  in only his first feature  is no exception hes aided mind you by exceptional performances brendan gleeson colin farrell and ralph fiennes doing terrific turns with some very offbeat sideways characters and his own competent scriptthe one shortcoming is the overthetop scene where ray ken and midget jimmy indulge in cocaine booze and offthewall banter about racial wars the scene comes across as an intrusion a dark throwaway one that is out of place in an otherwise gripping story of characters who have chosen a questionable  but intriguing  professionnot your typical hollywood ending by a long shot  but probably more satisfying especially because its not worth seeing,black_comedy
yes indeed the worst i have seen in a long time in that respect it is a classic every mistake a director can make is made in this one martin mcdonagh should not be allowed to make cinemamovies and he should stick to short ones bad acting bad dialog bad story bad choice of music silly humor badly performed slapstick all the characters seem out of place even a minor character like the usher in the church tower or the landlady in the hotelit starts off in a hotel hideout where two hirekillers have a casual conversation when one of them strikes a subject the other does not wish to have mentioned his killing of a child the way this is brought up is a giveaway to the bad acting throughout the movie and it continues to be bad and it never stops i was even horrified at the slapstick moment with the fat american touristcharacter why and how did the director decide to put in such a scene at all the actingout in the restaurant with the canadian tourist if this was supposed to be funny then apart from the terrible performance by colin farrell where am i supposed to start and stop laughing i can continue but i will notyou think while watching that brendan gleeson will at some point make up for the others complete failure to be plausible but no it brought tears to my eyes to think of the producers who will probably be sick till today,black_comedy
has two things going for it a tender poignant performance by colin farrell and bruges itself a city most of us dont pay much attention to other than that the film is derivative and almost empty  i say almost because it does have some content and that content is vilecolin farrell used to be the next big thing but that hasnt panned out and hes made a lot of small independent films like this one i hope his next movie offers him a script worthy of the acting talent he reveals herebruges is a city in belgium with lots of extant medieval structures and museums dedicated to medieval masters like jan van eyck and hieronymus bosch just shovels bruges on the screen no art is exercised theres no special lighting or setting or marrying of the films themes or dialogue to unforgettable images of bruges its structures paintings or swans doesnt do for bruges what a woody allen film does for manhattan or any number of movies do for parisoutside of farrells performance and the city itself is a ripoff of pulp fiction and sexy beast rather than john travolta and samuel l jackson as talkative hit men you get farrell and gleeson rather than ben kingsley in a contrarytotype role as a vicious crime lord you get ralph fiennes in a contrarytotype role as a vicious crime lord fiennes is surprisingly uninteresting and not at all scary herefor the most part you get gleeson and farrell strolling around bruges trading low key banal observations americans are fat racist and kill john lennon and vietnamese beer is good medieval art is deep these observations are larded with the f word so effing beer is effing good and effing medieval art effing is effing deep and effing americans effing are effing fat effing oh and since gleeson and farrell are irish and irish people are inherently cuter and more interesting than anyone else on the planet this movie thinks their banal fwork larded comments are all the more valuableand of course every twenty minutes or so the screen is spattered with blood as another character diesyou get the ideaheres the thing  the director and script writer the inherently cute and smart because irish martin mcdonagh doesnt know anything at all about crime or hit men or how bodies react to bullets mcdonagh doesnt even know the make of the guns he shows on screenbut mcdonagh knows that hed never be able to sell a movie about two irish accountants say or two irish sanitation workers or two irish school teachers strolling around a poorly lit because this is a low budget movie bruges trading banal observations about how effing wonderful effing beer effing is so he makes his characters hit men and voila suddenly everything they say is ultra fascinating or funny or profound in a way that it would not be had they been common working slobsthis could be called the bigmacinfrance trick in pulp fiction two hit men discuss the naming of fast food hamburgers its an incredibly banal conversation the only reason the movies largely teen male fans love the scene is because they believe the men having the conversation not to be john travolta and samuel l jackson but two hit men and hit men teen boys think are glamorous and inherently interesting and so their comments about big macs warrant careful attentionputting banal shallow dialogue into the mouth of an imaginary hit man who bares no relation to real life hit men in an effort to make his dialogue sound profound has got to be the cheapest trick in the book arthur miller managed to make willy loman a traveling salesman the most fascinating character in the world  through millers brilliant writing a great or even competent writer doesnt have to make his character a hitman to make his words matter,black_comedy
its getting harder and harder to find decent movies to attend or rent so i was looking forward to high praise brendan gleeson hapless gangsters etc what could be better but what a disappointmenti cant believe this movie has garnered the praise it has it was boring and amateurish there was nothing to the characters and if the dialogue was half as clever as it thought it was it wouldve been mildly amusing every single plot device may as well have come with sirens and flashing lights and to tie it all together into one big mess ralph fiennes is miscast and for colin farrell apparently acting equals working every facial muscle he owns this is no successor to tarentino or sexy beast not at all if it werent for the glimpses of brugess canals and medieval buildings id say this was a total wasteif you want to see wit humor and brendan gleeson as a reluctant thug with a younger sidekick try to find a copy of i went down,black_comedy
i have to say that i wasnt expecting much from this moviei thought it will be just another failor of making a good black humor comedyhowever i was wrongthis movie is excellentits followed by pretty depressive atmosphere which gives even more humor into the movieespecially when you find out why theyve been sentold medieval city collin farrell was greathis acting is greathe did an excellent portrait of depressivei dont give a damn criminalbrendan gleeson is even better an ralph fiennes acted this role so strange that you cant recognize himgood but strange anyway i wont write anything elseall i can say that you should watch this movieif not for the cast than for the movie it self because its greatgood directingacting and screenplay are making this movie as good as it isand it has one of the best endings ever enjoy,black_comedy
i honestly saw the trailer for it and had to see it sarcastic humor mixed with action with a pinch of sincerity whats not to like i thought the movie was well written acted and directed the setting was perfect and so was the casting all the way down to the little guy the only reason i gave it a 9 out of 10 wasspoiler was the fact that a guy was alive enough to speak after falling from a high platform other than that i had no complaints about the movie and even that scene didnt ruin it because of the fact that the movie was brillianti suggest everybody see this movie if you have a sense of humor and youre alright with gratuitous language910,black_comedy
given the track record of martin mcdonagh as an incredibly gifted playwright i expected to be smarter and funnier particularly smarter mcdonagh does have a way with words but it seems to have eluded him in this film which works better as a concept maybe it would work better as a play but as a film it feels halfbaked i see that he is referencing waiting for godot and hes playing with his usual mashup of violence and humor and he is paying homage to old masterful movies like touch of evil and vertigo but the whole thing feels really forced and rather soulless i am willing to suspend my disbelief and swallow that the wonderful brendan gleeson and the incredibly uneven colin farrell are hit men on holiday but why they really seem to be the nicest chaps with no edge of meanness lovable thugs who work for a fastidious thug played rather maniacally by ralph fiennes whose performance over the phone is actually funnier than when he actually shows up it is nice to see him in a comic role and sporting a perfect thuggish accent but he is not believable either and the actors are saddled with stupid lines which is really surprising coming from mr mcdonagh gleeson is divine as a hitman perfectly content to spend some downtime sightseeing he revels in the calm i love brendan gleeson and if there is a reason to see this movie he is it farrell is all over the place and trying really hard to be funny which may not be entirely his fault he is best when he feels guilty and dissolves into tears but otherwise he mugs for the camera like there is no tomorrow jeremie renier who has starred in the distinguished films of the dardenne brothers linfant and la promesse has a bit part here this always bothers me that when the big foreign production comes to town the best actors in that country end up playing stupid bit parts such is the pecking order there is a subplot involving a racist dwarf and fat americans so you know the movie is aiming low some american critics have vociferously objected to the violence which is really beyond me considering hollywood is still churning out violent porn like rambo the violence is over the top in concept as farrell kills human beings that are taboo to kill and this may be the point of the movie that the principles of criminals are bogus and killing anybody is wrong period but its a point we expected martin mcdonagh to make with his accustomed panache not all dumbed down,black_comedy
i rarely write reviews but this tripe inspired me it could have been called stupid people doing stupid things one killer cant shut up it seems he believes other people are fascinated at everything that goes on in his life to the minutest detail the script is full of holes people that hold a gun on someone close enough for them to take it away a supposedly professional killer walking through a park with his weapon held in his hand for all to see and the stupidity goes on and on things that no one with an ounce of common sense would do so if you enjoy foolishness and like to believe it makes perfect sense watch this film,black_comedy
there are a lot of writerly things going on with this script most of them are standard devices almost too standardbut there is something i noticed the spoiler here is that the story takes over by the very end and the structure of the story forces the characters to knowingly act as they know they must even at great sacrifice this works by two means one is conventional the code of the assassins is underscored as it is in hundreds of movies this is supplemented by the nature of the place as a sort of purgatory which has its own rules leading toward passagebut theres a second writerly trick at work here its the use of story fragments being introduced at one point in the story in such a way that they are tagged with significance then those story dynamics take on a life of their own and retouch the narrative later on an example is that the threat of a bottle is introduced later that threat appears its only done there and a few other times so we can subconsciously read the sense of the story midgets dying guns in rivers written instruction weight and climbing stairs prostitutesof course the allimportant film within the film makes an appearance so this sets us up for the noirdriven ending where an earlier story element inserts itself taking controlferrell always understood this method even as bullseye hes good that one what would we do without the irish and australiansteds evaluation  3 of 3 worth watching,black_comedy
so british with its perfect blind of comedy and drama the acting is superb the story is simple tight and entertaining from beginning to end so nice to see such a well done small film id like to see a dozen more this yearthough the plot is simple brugeskenbrendan gleeson and ray colin farrells profane crass irish assassins are as funny as it gets two mismatched friends who kill for money but really might die for each other but themselves are both totally lacking in sophistication bring a little archie bunker to euro cinema and if thats not enough much to the delight of even ray theres even a midget,black_comedy
just an excellent film absolutely hilarious from start to finish colin farrell is so mindbendingly off colour in this flick some of the things that come out of his mouth had tears rolling down my face i was laughing so hard and at the same time the movie has some real raw emotion that almost had me in tears for a completely different reason brendon gleeson turns in a great performance and ralph feinnes is hardcore martin mcdonagh is a brilliant writer and director and look forward to seeing what he comes up with next there is something for everyoneno kids in this flick some serious gangsterism pints sex drugsdrama and a midget in a schoolboy uniformwhat else could you ask for in a film i couldnt recommend a movie higher this may be the best film ive seen all year second only to ironman possibly,black_comedy
the movie was absolutely stunning excellent quotes you can get out of this movie the conversations were simply smartfunny filled with dark pure british humor i have seen all the movies from imdb top 250 newer than 1990 yes i have spent a lot of time i have been a fan of this website since i found out about it which is probably 1998 ive never felt like registering with the website until now when i saw the movie i have seen the trailer of the movie and i got to say all great movies have very poor trailers or no trailers at all i didnt really ever liked colin farrell but he had an outstanding performance in this movie the other movie that i would i recommend with cf is phone booth rest of the movies i just think he acts a bit to cockie anyway brilliant movie the english pacient gives again good performance,black_comedy
this is a thinlydisguised ripoff of quentin tarantinos pulp fiction instead of john travolta and samuel l jackson as the hitmen we have colin farrell and brendan gleeson in pulp fiction john travoltas character was just back from amsterdam here farrell and gleason are just over the dutch border belgium like jackson and travolta farrell and gleason spend most of their time arguing about trivial things there is also drugtaking as in tarantinos movie but this film is nonleague compared to pulp fictions premiership statusas in pulp fiction the hitmen work for a scary mr big character here played by ralph fiennes in one of his worst performances instead of ving rhames fiennes has clearly seen ben kingsleys performance in sexy beast and hes tried to pitch his performance at the same hysterical level the difference is that kingsley had some terrific dialogue to say in his film where fiennes just screams the fword so often here that you just wish hed shut up after a while fiennes also seems to be doing a peter cook impression using the same nasal whiny intonations of the late comic genius hes terrible in it but the script has to take some of the blame for that tooif you like making fun of midgets as the writer of this film seems to then this movie is for you the socalled jokes about little people arent funny and they become repetitive and offensive after a while if midgets were the funniest subject in the world then this movie would be the best comedy of all time but theyre not and it isnt its a failed stab at humour thats poorly executedthe script was written by a playwright and like a play its all talk and no action every second word is the fword in a desperate bid at humour you become numb to it after a while ralph fiennes shows up at the end to try and liven things up but by then its too late to care this is an overrated mess of a movie,black_comedy
take an inauthentic theme british hitmen and a ludicrously inapposite location bruges belgium add an unconvincing love interest and cook with a preposterous villain and you get this film does not know whether its a comedy or a tragedy and works as neither it breaks the solemn movie law by having no hero and all its characters are thoroughly unlikeable it is the quintessential entertainment made by those who can do nothing for those with nothing to doyou can see how the basic idea could have tweaked the moneymens interest three british psychopaths cause mayhem in quiet picturesque eurotown sadly it reinforces all the ugly stereotypes of uk soccer thugs refusing to speak the language and trampling over the locals theres even a rude jokesituation about canadians just for good measure so thats the basic package buy it if you like ittheres no point in going into the script its meaningless the love interest is a lobotomised and marginalised figure so women forget it toothe main character no way hes a hero played by colin farrell is supposed to have shot a child accidentally and his partner is to execute him for it something he never dreamt of as in the rest of the film there is no police presence around the killing a thoroughly childish aspect of this boyish venture bruges has been chosen by their boss ralph fiennes who should have known better because it will give the victim a little view of fairyland before he dies the mawkish sentimentality is not just the fiennes characters it is also that of the director michael mcdonaghif it is not enough to have polluted the world to a wasteland we have men dishing up this kind of mindless rubbish in the cinemas and on television dear oh dear oh dear,black_comedy
i have never rated any films on this site but i really hated this movie i thought i should warn other people that this movie is really bad it was really slow going and there was nothing to keep you interested for the second half they tried for humor and came up extremely short i thought the casting of the characters was way off they didnt mesh well together for the story i usually dont mind colin farrell however these days he has not done anything noteworthy at all this included i thought this was a complete waste of time and money i wish i had of opted for something different do yourself a huge favor and skip this movie,black_comedy
2008 had two highprofile crime time comedies that blended action with suspense and a hintage of good ol european humor on one hand we have the slick rocknrolla that brought guy ritchie back into the spotlight and now we have a newschool director delivering one of the most unique hitman films in a very long time is one of those rare examples in which the comedy is so bleak so dark it can barely pass off as humor depending on the viewer marketed as a quirky action comedy this film doesnt match the genre in the least bit instead we have a deep character study that focuses on the moral implications of the main characters as they tour around a beautiful yet overlooked city its definitely not everyones cup of tea the film itself is interesting and fleshes out a clever story but never quite gets off the ground never quite propels itself to become a highly entertaining film then of course we have the indie endingfollows two hit men that must lay low after a mission went horrifically wrong while ray colin ferell soaks in the bitterness and guilt over his murder rays partner ken soaks in all the beautiful scenery and curiosity of the area they both become wellacquainted with the place meeting all sorts of characters however things become complicated when their boss ralph fieness has a new job for one of them this is the debut featurefilm script and directorial effort by martin mcdonagh as he crafts a good tale that has the same style of dark humor and tense action as his acclaimed short film from years ago originality is all over the place in this film as dark humor is a tough genre to sell and deliver its rarely ever done successfullythe film is a delightful character study about peoples actions reactions and the codes they must follow irony and subtle humor is also heavily present as the mere premise of two murderous hit men touring around a secluded town like tourists is sure to tickle the funnybone the script also calls for sympathy towards our antiheroes which is definitely a hard task that mcdonagh tackled with ease helping the writing is superb acting by ferell and brendan gleeson if they dont interest you bruges certainly will bruges is basically a character in the film as it adjusts and alters the mindsets and morality codes of our assassins beautiful scenery and nice cinematography makes a travel documentary with a fictional story attachedhowever the dark humor in the movie is a bit too dark the movie can barely classify as a comedy because theres so much tension so much violence and so many heavy themes a few chuckles will occur but its offset by the bitter humor that leaves you cringing at times in other reviews has been described as irish humor if thats the case irish humor is definitely not my cup of tea as its comedy is disguised in heavy dramabottom line a nicely written and acted film marred by socalled comedy the humor comes off as bitterly dark and sometimes even dwells into the outright bizarre if you can handle the dark chocolatelike taste the 85 cacao bean kind then you are in for a treat the story is unique so are the characters and situations they are involved in this just might be american mainstreams first taste of irish flavored filmmaking in years and you can whether enjoy the flavor or move on while the movie itself isnt amazing this newschool director deserves a bit of attention for a strong first effort a documentary with bullets and bodiesthe food there looks good though,black_comedy
i realize i am in the minority here but suffice it to say that i thought this was one of the worst films ive ever seen and no i do not consider myself a prude i can appreciate irreverence as much as the next bloke every sperm is sacred  now theres inspired comedy but billing this as a comedy has to be the height of false advertising the killing of the child the shooting and the suicide off the bell tower the unrelenting unnecessary multiple shootings of ray in the final scenes  just too too much the director unfortunately will have delusions of grandeur because he thinks his eurotrash movie full of realistic vulgarity and violence is a genuine piece of art,black_comedy
now im really into classy cinema and i usual like what all the critics like but i really dont understand why this has been hyped up so much its a fairly straight forward plot about two guys that are hitman and are basically chilling out in belgium i guess the film talks on some levels about friendship and atonement but it doesnt save the boring plot colin farrel does an ok job i guess and ralph fiennes is my favourite in this even though hes hardly in it i wouldnt class this film as a comedy even though there are some subtle comedy underlinings id be more accurate by saying this film is a moody and dramatic piece i really couldnt find anything special about this i didnt hate it it had its moments of originality and i guess some people will love this but the film really didnt grab mei am extremely astonished that this is in the top 250 its makes me think there must be something subliminal going on in this film that i didnt catch on too overall this film was a let down and really left me feeling like i wasted my money from purchasing it 4510jd seaton,black_comedy

in order to see in my neck of the woods one would have to be specifically looking for it it is a film that has been put out in limited release immediately after oscar picks have been announced in other words the studios arent giving it much of a shot so when i hear people refer to this film as overrated i scratch my head with a bemused gaze what were you looking for what did you think you were about to see my expectations were exceeded by no small margin the genre of the bantering hit men has no doubt been played out again and again but seemed to put life back into that concept others feel that this film doesnt know what kind of film it wants to be but i argue that this weakness is actually the films biggest triumph the audience reaches a comfort zone of seeing colin farrellss character giddy with the prospect of seeing a film crew filming midgets only to witness the death of a young boy within minutes bruges itself becomes a character and i felt as though i could comfortably navigate myself through the town where i have never been after seeing this filmthe basics can be summed up quickly two hit men are sent to hide out belgium after executing a hit in london farrell hates the town while brendan gleeson who is admittedly unhitmanishloves the simplicity of his sightseeing simple right however within that simple structure lies intricacies that show the dichotomy between the two characters to the point where it is tough to decide who you sympathize more with colin farrell seems to be caught in a state of arrested development a pouting yet humorous eight yearold who just so happens to be a novice hitman gleeson reminds one of the history professor who has just retired and is seeing the sights though he just so happens to be an experienced hitman the pleasure is in their exchanges the little boy and the artful old man who have both found ways to rationalize their occupations to themselves and are stuck togethernot enough the absurdities of the situation are amplified by ideas that would have came off well on mr show a hitman who wants to talk his mark out of suicide a racist midget who ironically condemns others for their physical appearances and the most damage ive ever seen come from shooting blanks i dont mean to offset the fact that there is a serious side as well death is very real here and humor does not make life cheap farrell is honestly suicidal and the image of the dead boy haunts the characters as well as the audience but the most important thing is that this film works i did laugh and im not a saccharine individual and i did care about the charactersto think that a film is high on itself does not move me in either direction mainly because ive never really figured out what it means what should a film be modest what should this film have done cut scenes that one individual might not find as funny as another one i enjoyed this film beyond all expectations and if this film is not smart or too high on itself then i guess i will accept a regression to being thought of as one of the dumb ones,black_comedy
the movie is a dark comedy dialogs between gleeson farrell and fiennes are hilarious if you like movies like pulp fiction or similar you should see this one the bloody stuff is not too much just right and the pictures of bruges add even some romantic touch to it overall excellent writing excellent acting i even revised my opinion about colin farrell whom i didnt like to much before the plot is twisted but easy to follow one last warning though if you get easily offended by racist or midget humor you should probably stay away i didnt find anything offending but others might see it differently the irish dialect gave me some minor trouble understanding everything at first english is only my second language but i got used to it over the run of the movie,black_comedy
being this the first feature film of recognized play maker martin mcdonagh i did not really knew what to expect to be honest i only knew that colin farrel was in this and that martin mcdonaghs short six shooter won an academy awardif you watched and enjoyed i recommend this short i was not much of a fan of farrel and i have to admit this movie changed my whole perception of himi can see him now like a true actorthe movie itself its packed with a lot of dark humoralso with action and drama some scenes can be very touching and other ones can be pretty funny toowonderfully shot in the outdoors of bruges in belgium and with flawless script and direction the cast is perfectly chosen being farrel and gleeson two irish hit mens working in london and after a job went bad and told to hide posy playing a local custom and builds a relationship with farrels character and finally ralph fiennes plays the ultimate mastermind of this london criminal groupthis movie is truly one of 2008s cinema gems and i highly recommend it for anyone looking for a very well made film,black_comedy
i went in to this movie avoiding much info on this movie the result was greatits hard to some the movie up but the main thing about it is its character driven the characters are realistic and down to earth especially for hit men brendan gleason is old and wise as well as more mature than his partner he is calm through most of the movie and not bothered by their situation colin farrell on the other hand is messed up and seeks to get out of bruges many could relate to him being the annoying traveller of the groupthe story starts out slow but by the end you will not feel ripped off colin farrell is a young hitman who has just been on his first hit not too spoil things but things dont go too well so he is sent away to bruges with another hitman to look after him brendan gleason however things seem to escalate getting even worse the two of them try to keep a low profile but end up giving up colin farrell gets involved with a girl meets a midget whos making a movie etc brendan gleason however gets another assignment from his boss ralph fiens and is torn between loyaltiesthis movie is fantastic and for the first half of the movie will keep you laughing however it gets much darker towards the end this movie has a few scenes of violence most of which are quite disturbing but despite the dark themes you can always expect great dialogue between colin and brendanralph fiens is great as a mean guy with a cockney accent he and the other two main cast members also overcome each of their individual problems in a surprising waythis movie is very funny and very intriguing with three great actors i would recommend it to fans of guy ritchie or quentin tarantino but in my opinion i found this movie deeper than most of their movies,black_comedy
one of my favourite films to come out of 2008 and possibly of all time originally went to the cinema to see something else but that film sold out so we chose this film having only ever seen a poster for itthe film is hilarious by far the funniest film ive seen in a while it also is quite violent in places but mcdonagh gets the balance just rightgreat performances from farrell gleeson  fiennes i have never been a big fan of farrell but he did very well in this part having not really seen much of gleeson or fiennes stuff i went in with an open mind and they were both excellent tooa great film with superb humour 1010,black_comedy
ok so this movie is watchable it didnt make me want to vomit with cringeworthiness like say eragon it had some novelty to it it was funny in places that saidi wouldnt recommend seeing this movie there were several reasons i didnt like it its a feel bad movie you might come out of it wanting to go home and have a bit of a cry about how nothing really made you feel like justice had been done or your brain had been pleasuredfor a start youd better be prepared to hear one of the two main protagonists ray colin farrell whinge and whine about how he just hates bruges every 5 minutes or so in the movie this grated on me a lot rays character irritated me in just about every way imaginable he is rude arrogant ignorant and gets a kick out of hitting killing and insulting people particularly midgets for this the storyline rewards him with the love of a beautiful belgian girl this felt very unjust and just plain irritated me for the whole movie i kept hoping ray was going to dieyoud also better not be easily offended when people say this movie has lots of black humour theyre not lying few taboos are left unbroken short perhaps of paedophilia drugs sex violence racism insults you name it its in there im not easily offended nor am i politically correct but the casual overuse of these somewhat nasty tones for frequent black humour also grated on me it made me feel badin conclusion you may want to see this movie it may surprise you at times but probably not in a good way it will not make you feel happy and youll probably be quite satisfied that those who die in the movie die theyre all quite nasty people,black_comedy
total rubbishi can not believe an actor as good ralph fiennes would waste his time on such a pointless movie i have no problem touching on taboos for humour but it should be funny and some of the lines were just plain offensive with no real comedic valuethe only good thing about this was brugesmartin mcdonagh fails in this movie i rarely want my money back after watching something but i did with thisif you are black gay or vertically challenged you may want to avoid this movie,black_comedy
once again after reading the reviews i decided to watch this british comedy but was left feeling depressed and verbally assaulted absolutely no imagination went into this movie nor did any notion of comedy that i am familiar withthe movie is incredibly offensive and thinks its being funny people walked out of the cinema it was that badsometimes it really makes me wonder what the movie reviewers are thinking when they write these praise filled reviews do not see if you like to be entertained do see if you like being made a fool of you have been warned,black_comedy
massive spoilers ahead if you havent seen it stop reading instead go buy the film right now considering the average score and my rating you know it cant be badis an amazing film on so many levels basically its about two irish hit men ray and ken working in london they fk up a job big time and they are forced to hide out by their boss harry so far nothing groundbreaking it seems like a standard action comedy flick but its only so much more than that id say its a comedy drama because of all the funny moments and amazingly witty dialog and the subject of the movie which is dead serious thats the perfect blend in my opinion  you get humor and seriousness but those two opposites enhance each other when confronted the funny bits are even funnier and the serious bits really get under your skin what i love most about this film are the characters and its interesting that there is no real bad guy technically harry would be the bad guy but you can also argue for his point of view ray  the main character hes young inexperienced and a very direct person he says whats on his mind no matter the consequences he killed a little boy and hes having a very hard time coping with that on the verge of suicide but in the end he rediscovers the joy of life and decides that he doesnt want to die we know he didnt mean to kill the boy and we see his remorse but still he is a hitman he is a bad man  you cant deny that but you like him so you dont want him to die ken  rays mentor so to speak the older wiser hitman hes much more cultivated and easy going and a very mild person in general which seems odd for his line of work and that only makes him more interesting he wants to give ray a second chance because he believes that ray can change and that he will redeem himself if he quits this line of work and saves the next little boyharry  the boss perhaps the most interesting character of them all i cant see him as a bad person hes a fair man who sticks to his principles and actually cares about other people which is clearly showed near the end where hes asking he pregnant hotel owner to step aside because being a nice person he doesnt want to put her in harms way have you ever seen a hitman do that before i think its amazing he believes that you cant expect to kill a little boy and get away it that makes sense its a terrible crime which you should be punished for i really love the ambiguity of the characters and the depth they add to the film its hard to decide whose side youre onoh i could go on for ages about this is funny heart breaking violent exciting serious clever beautiful and most important of all  its deep it really makes you think its rare to see a fun film with so much depth i mean has hit men ever been more human this really is european film at its best,black_comedy
i would call this a black comedy it contains some very dark subject matter that wont appeal to everybody but its also different than anything else ive ever seen  thought provoking and yet funny at the same time my kind of movie the musical score is quite excellentproduction values are generally good though its obviously not a big budget feature however the intellectual content more than makes up for any lack of big screen special effects or opulent sets the two main characters colin farrell and brendan gleeson turn in compelling performances that convince the viewer that this not a movie but a documentary of a real eventoverall i highly recommend it for anybody who enjoys thought provoking cinema and doesnt mind if its a bit on the dark side,black_comedy
there are many great reviews of this film and all are justified what drew our interest to it was we used to live in belgium and have been to brugge flemish spelling on several occasions it is truly a beautiful town and that is what makes this such a great movie as it is the perfect backdrop for the plot the acting is absolutely brilliant kudos to colin farrell most likely his best performance ever the script well written and overall it is just what a movie should be a balanced combination of humor action and drama this is far from a brainless action flick this movie draws the viewer in and holds their attention the entire time this is one to buy on dvd as like i you will want to watch it every so often as it remains as fresh and entertaining as the first time,black_comedy
i rarely heap unqualified praise on a film as i can generally find something to get my claws in but not with it is a masterpiece of black comedy i loved it so much i watched it twice in seven days and could watch it again and again and still laughit is one of those films where as they say the chemistry is perfect gleesons performance is stupendous a large brooding man with a soft interior acts as the perfect foil for farrels almost manic character the script is superbly crafted and the timing of these two actors would put many a stand up comedian to shamei admire the director for selecting bruges for the backdrop how many more cockney gangsta films must we see that are shot in london he has broken the mouldi have to admit i have no liking for ralph fiennes how could anybody like a pratt that insists on being called rafe and not ralph conceit or what having said that his character performance is brilliant it goes from parody to menacing and his face and accent for the role fit the bill perfectlyi think its going to be a long long time before i see another film of this calibrei would shower this film with awards and it is to be hoped the directorwriter gets busy with some more high class entertainmentexcellent,black_comedy
it has been my lot in life to know  at least to the extent of taking part in conversations with  three and a half hit men two definitely and three who might have been killers for hire none of them were possessed so far as i could judge of any great sense of moral angst existential anguish or philosophic underpinnings to their professions even to the extent of the get er done attitude of larry the cable guy instead they struck me as thugs who were at times gigglingly happy that people would pay them money for something they gladly did for any or no reason whatsoever one of them was reputed to have killed his own mother by bashing her head repeatedly against a radiator  perhaps she was not the most lovable of women the others struck me as not much more entertaining despite the fascinating lines of white powder they put on the table for the use of the ladies none were possessed of the ability to quote apocrypha at length discourse on the shmoo or hew to moral precepts at appropriate moments indeed the most accurate depiction of the type may have been alan ladds turn in this gun for hire asked how he felt when he kills someone he replies fiercely and blankly i feel fine i mention this at the start because accepts at face value certain assumptions that have become rampant since quentin tarrantino got pulp fiction released in this movie we have what could have been a black comedy except that only ralph fiennes and peter dinklage seem to think it is one colin farrell plays a character similar to his recent turn in cassandras dream except that he shows his range by assuming an irish accent and brendan gleeson adds some weight  no pun intended  and kills any comedy by his serious and excellent acting bruges is very photogenic in obvious ways  the only other time i have seen this city in a movie was one of leonce perrets endless tableaux epics about lace makers filmed about 95 years agothe net result is a movie that you enjoy when you are watching it until you go outside and think about it all of them wind up dead good to hear except that in the real world they dontit would be all too easy to accept this as a great picture based on its track record a fine cast a writerdirector who just won an oscar for best short subject excellent cinematography and so on but looking at the heart of it you should see its intellectual and artistic laziness its acceptance of false assumptions because they enable the creator to gloss over its vacuity with fine words but it does not use its assumptions to challenge us in any way except to try to convince us that vicious uncaring murderers are people just like you and me well they arent like me and i know the difference i hope that you do too,black_comedy
uhm okey this film is listed as a comedydramacrime genre it should be in the drama and crime genre only i didnt find this film amusing at all it had the slowest start in the history of all films when it came about half way through the action factor increased slightly now i can see how some people would think its funny but its just on rare ocations that funniness occurs the film is very predictable i mean there are just a couple of actions made that came unexpected but everythingelse is just so god damn predictable anyways this wasnt a film for me obviously but im sure a lot of people like it its something a bit unordinary and fresh but so slow that i almost stopped watching itand i had a hard time hearing what everybody said even colin was hard to understand a times,black_comedy
brilliant observational comedy juxtaposed with profound violent tragedy the director plays postmodern pinball with your emotion common morality is murdered in a film where anything goes as long as you dont kill a small boy or attack someone with a bottle the summarised by a brilliant overdinner exchange between ray a straightforward and simple hitman and chloe a stunningly beautiful heroin dealer to belgian film crewsbeautiful cinematography around beautiful brugge soundtrack perfectly suited to the everchanging mood of the film impeccable timing in impressive performances by all actors apart from the fat american i know i dont speak for everyone here but this is filming perfection sceptical comical profound chaotic and unpredictable if i had to suggest you watch one more film before you die it would be this one an exaggeration maybe but this is a special one,black_comedy
warningthe language in this review is like the language in the moviejust not gratuitouscolin farrell plays an assassin who is pretty much like father dougal from the father ted television series though he also is sadistic and thoroughly unlikable and obnoxious brendan gleeson from the oscarwinning short six shooter plays a less obnoxious murderer these are the two funny heroes of this filmaccording to imdb the word fuck and its derivatives are said 126 times in this 107minute film an average of 118 fucks per minute to me this combined with the fact that the leading men are assassins is more than enough reason to hate this film while at times it seemed pretty clever and even interesting i found everyone so repellent and stupid that i just couldnt stick with the film life is too short to watch crude films like this and i hate films where there is no one to care about at all although this film is in the imdb top 250 i can assume that this is a film youll either love or hatebut probably mostly love if you are a rather traditional guy like me youll be irritated by the sloppiness of injecting the fword into every other sentence and see it as not just offensive but poor writing any idiot can say obscenities again and againthis isnt a sign of brilliance but of inadequacy and this seems to be the recent trend in other supposedly great films and making hateful heroes is a sure way to drive away many in the audience truly a film you either love or hate,black_comedy
i really dont know which film people saw but the one i just watched was one of the most depressing gory boring and pointless films i have ever watched to call this film a comedy is like calling rear window a comedy a few few jokes and some strange characters do not make a comedythis film is about suicide death killing of innocent children guilt and hopelessness just what people find funny about this eludes methe unpc dialog seemed forced and unfunnyregarding the thrillerdramacrime aspect i was never engaged with the characters and every plot twist could be seen 20 minutes before handi cant remember the last time i was so disappointed with a filmas a straight dramathriller the film put me to sleep combined with a total lack of laughs i rate this a 3 and strongly advise people to ignore the trailer  it was very misleading to me,black_comedy
directorwriter martin mcdonaghs stunningly incredulous piece of sentimental claptrap involving touchy feely hit men and highly principled mob kingpins is all location location ive never visited a lovelier large town and this tale about a lethal laurel and hardy team is an insult to its nameken and ray have just performed a sloppy hit in which a priest and a young child are the victims theyre ordered to hideout until they get further word from their boss harry waters when orders do arrive they are for ken to kill ray veteran hit man ken however goes soft for cuddly developmentally delayed ray and cant go through with it this is where things become absurdly unrealisticmcdonagh is well schooled in coen and tarantino but there are only hints of the former and an excess of the latter theres some nice comic dialogue in the early going that balances well with the violent moments but after fortyfive minutes things become convoluted and insipid as kingpin waters takes it upon himself to go to bruges alone assaulting citizens and running through town shooting away at ray since from the looks of things the entire bruges police force is on christmas holidays and its left up to a pregnant hotel keeper to stand between gun toting thugs even though ray and ken go soft they are physically resilient to the point of super hero status ken already shot and bleeding profusely falls from a roughly three hundred foot church tower splatters on the cobblestones but still manages to warn ray whose tough hide takes four shots to the trunk of his body but is gamely hanging on at the end a supporting cast of ugly north americans a dwarf a wimpy skin head and a misunderstood drug dealing hooker thief whose a sweet girl at heart are erratically developed and manage only to contribute to the films torpid pacemcdonagh spills blood liberally mixing it with heavy handed symbolism but its pure comic book by the last half so its hard to take the plot or the characters seriously colin farrells ray has the makings of a fascinating and absorbing character in the films early moments but soon dilutes the suspense with a more impish than tortured approach that just repeats itself as ken brendan gleeson displays a world weary fatigue with a convincing glum resignation that makes him the films most interesting character before going soft and doing the inane swan dive from the church ralph fiennes is completely over the top as the illogical mob bossmcdonagh does a fine job of filming bruges particularly at night but this is supposed to be more than a travelogue and his imagery and editing is unimaginative is one botched collage of poorly woven ideas incoherently realized by a juvenile imagination they should not have let mcdonagh and company across the town line,black_comedy
this movie was great most movies now a days are not very involved this movie takes a hold of you and doesnt let go until the end one minute your laughing the next your on the verge of tears because of it intense sadness brilliant the film is very english so if you dont really like that type of humor this movie might not be for you but please give it a chance it is well worth the ten dollars for a movie ticket collin farrelspelling did a great job in this movie i have always been somewhat disappointed with his movie picks but this role was made for him beautiful acting beautiful music and a beautiful backdrop this movie is amazing go and see it,black_comedy
first of all this was advertised to me as a comedy but it most certainly was not there were a few repetitive and tasteless jokes by the characters made about paedophilia black people dwarfs and bruges the plot itself was not funny but in fact repulsiveray killed a priest near the start of the movie without feeling bad about it he starts arguments and fights with anyone he stole from his girlfriend and yet the movie seems to be presented as though we should like this guyrays friend comforts himself about his career as a hitman by saying that his victims were mostly bad people yet doesnt want to kill his grubby friend raythe work with the camera was good and so was the sound,black_comedy
the plot in a nutshell two hit men are hiding their boss is angry because one of them messed up his first job some redemption and hope at the end so far so good apart form the fact that i was not specially in need of yet another britunderworld movie however the main problem with this one is that it tries too hard it tries hard to be  at least  like two very good movies such as the third man and sexy beast it tries hard to be funny cool and smart failing miserably along the lines it tries hard to make bruges look like a place you want to visit i have been there and i agree with the colin farrels character  it is not to put it mildlythe part where it tries to be the third man is obviously the location and night scenes but also the fact that the main villain is named harry said villain is played along the lines of the great ben kingsley  the psycho youll love to hate which made sexy beast such a good movie ralph fiennes tries too hard to upstage kingsley but he is never believable as the gang leader with a personality split between the psycho and the loving father kingsley is just unbeatable exactly because he was constantly over the top with none of the mushy sentimentality of a good father but the huge black hole of the whole story is the attempt of making us believe that these criminals actually care about strangers unfortunately there is no honor among thieves if they are criminals it is exactly because they do not care about collateral damage being it a pregnant woman a harmless child or an elderly guyfinally it is extremely difficult to root for any of the characters they are incredibly verbose just go on and on with lines of absurd dialog act in ways that are not consistent with criminal backgrounds and are simply very unlovable colin farrell is supposed to be the nice bad guy but he is quite nasty with serious angermanagement issues which would suggest he is way beyond redemption in a restaurant scene he hits a man and his girlfriend just because they complained about cigarette smoke if that is acceptable behavior in somebodys book is not in mine i would object having my face smashed even by a goodlooking thug like colini am surprised by the good reviews but maybe it is because i have been and totally do not care to go back,black_comedy
dont much like films made like this one ultimately psychopathically vicious treacherous and murderous butlets have big fun with it by making bloody murder and psychopathic hit men funny in the beginning before we get down to the real cruel blood and guts at the end more or less a tired copy of one of tarantinos films like pulp fiction and it was mostly a one trick pony commercially calculated to depict sick but marginally entertaining segments of contrived and cruel human behavior including all the violence blood and suffering an audience could stand for 2 hours without turning theaters into vomiteriums the worst aspect of this film was that it shamelessly copied others in this genre who have done a much better job of it like tarantino peckinpah and scorcese was two disparate films tacked togetherthe first one was a goofy near monty python sketch of a forced stay belgium by two joking and wisecracking hit men sent there by their head man to cool off after a botched assignment in the uk and the second part was a cruelly vicious and bloody version of a typical peckinpahscorcesetarantino film of terminal comeuppance and payback for treachery and nearly limitless earlier sins the two film parts and the characters actions in each part did not match well and thus the result looked contrived and uneven overall and appeared to be done by one who has a lot to learn about what makes a film good and that includes consistent characterization that he did not well control and it does not include shamelessly copying a story style done better many times in the past 40 years and essentially pretty worn down by nowso to me there was little substance that was interestingly new or different here instead go see no country for old men for this story genre done as well as it can be done but bruges did look like a nice place to visit,black_comedy

poor old bruges ive never been there but the name of the town will now forever evoke the collocation shithole in my mindray and ken are two assassins sitting in out after a botched job why bruges asks ray why indeed the answer becoming clearer as the opening banter gives way to a darker undercurrentcolin farrell has never been better playing the dumbbutdeadly ray the humour though not always successful is daring at times delightfully the film makes no attempt to pander to an american audience delicate souls from the the states might come out of this one chestthumping farrells courting of a local film pa sets up most of the comedic moments along with his reluctant mentoring by gleeson when called upon to provide some deeper emotions farrell rises to the occasion with aplombgleeson who has quietly built an incredible cv that includes braveheart and gangs of new york is as dependable as ever when the boss charges him with a repugnant task his inner turmoil is alltooevidentboth men so used to acting in foreign accents clearly revel in the exchanges in unadulterated irish englishthe casting of ralph fiennes as london hood harry waters is less successful fiennes appears late in what appears to be almost a cameo but the holding back of his presence is somewhat undercut by featuring his visage prominently on the poster his performance is too derivative of ben kingsley in sexy beast and comes across as poor parody he does share one of the films best moments with gleeson in the pavement caf in a heated discussion revolving around an insult to his kids but his character arc is forced and his demise far too contrived telegraphed as soon as the dwarf appears in school uniformthe running gags about dwarfs committing suicide and the fighting prowess of the vietnamese are fresh and inventive gleeson and farrell pitch their odd couple routine to a tee is both funny and moving and is not to be missed,black_comedy
the wittiest script since all about eve combined with deep insights magnificent performances brilliant scenery fine cinematography excellent music  its hard to fault this great film at its core is the superb performance by colin farrell proving yet again that he is one of the finest actors of his generation check him out in woody allens cassandras dream as well and youll see what i mean a perfect blend of comic timing rough charm and vulnerability  its a knockout performance and thats not to diminish the work of brendan gleeson ralph fiennes or any of the other cast members  even the bit part players are terrific best not to say too much about the plot as its better to see it with fresh eyes  but martin mcdonagh deserves to be showered with awards for his work as both writer and director and its his first feature and its not a bad tourist ad for bruges either i hope this film comes up at oscar time  it truly deserves to,black_comedy
fantastic if it were just a movie that had great shots of brugge that would be enough but it also has a great story that is hard to predict where it will go at the beginning of the movie i thought to myself it could well do without colin farrell but by the end he had won me over i particularly liked the bit about the guy not letting brendan gs character into the tower because he was short 010 i lived in belgium for 2 years and this is absolutely what they would do  most uptight people ive ever encountered in my life i actually got kicked off a train in brugge because my train pass had been improperly stamped mind you im not the one that did the stampingbrugge is one of the most spectacularly beautiful cities ive ever been to and this film does it justice with its cinematography and storyline this isnt a life changing movie but it is an extremely good indie film that should not be missedi full well realize this is a shite review but that should not dissuade you from seeing this movie if you have any interest,black_comedy
i have to start this one off by saying this isnt a movie to take home for grandma to enjoy starring colin farrell brendan gleeson and ralph fiennes is a well played dark comedy for those who relish the poetic use of obscenities it is a filthladen film that unapologetically abuses every word your mom wishes wasnt in the dictionary when watching this movie you are quick to realize that the over use of foul language is simply one aspect of the comedy that writerdirector martin mcdonagh uses as a niche to carve out his piece of the film world for me this was just the tip of all the fun has to offerwinner of an academy award in 2006 for his short film six shooter also starring gleeson celebrated british playwright mcdonaghs first feature length film is hopefully a glimpse into a bright future of filmmaking for much like six shooter mcdonagh uses his writing talents to tell a comical story through a dark and twisted sense of humor in addition with a shock of ultra violence within a not too violent film it is sure to make all fans of foul words and blood scream for joyit is difficult to offer a comparison for such as if you like that one youll like this one sort of thing i would however put it in the same genre as tarantino films guy ritchies snatch and lock stock  two smoking barrels boondock saints and very bad things this whole genre of modern day melodramas are films that use a bit of extreme violence with extreme language all perpetuated by extremely bad decisions then to top it all off we the audience are meant to view these things as a comedy i love it the story of is of two hit men farrell and gleeson that are sent to the city of bruges in belgium to sit tight and await new orders from their boss played by fiennes bruges is a simple historic little town and no place for the likes of these two a skewed view of a code of honor places the two hit men in a violent battle with their employer and when the past catches up with them the mayhem ensuesagain this film isnt for everyone a person near and dear to me said it best some people just cant see past the  if youre lucky enough to qualify as being not one of these people then run out and get your copy of today and ing enjoy it,black_comedy
ray you cant sell horse tranquilliser to a midget i was massively surprised with this film it has an impressively good story which honestly stands out in the miasma of hitman gets a heart films stumbling onto our screens in brgge manages to pull of a yarn that is both touching and side splittingly funny at the same time the visuals are nicely shot catching the quaintness of little brugge in all its diminutive glorythe acting is also spot on with the main leads providing excellent portrayal of their characters fiennes is brilliant gleeson is noble and farrel is frankly hilarious in what is the best part ive seen him playthis film comes highly recommended so much so that i had to spit out 10 lines of a review on here for the first time a refreshingly brilliant movie,black_comedy
ray ray ray we cant help but be captured by his goofiness his petulance his pique he is like a bad puppy he is what happens when potential and opportunity do not cross paths we are given no real background on any of the characters only this slice of their livesbut sophistication isnt required here we see the essence of wastrelism in ray the inevitable greek tragedy of ken ken who should and does know better in harry we see the kind of principled villainy that is wierdly common ie the bank robber who would never steal a car or say the rapist who would never stiff a waitress for a tip ken and ray a fine pair of irishmen work for a good fellow named harry ken is the greater tragedy of this comitragic and even occasionally sublime duo this movie speaks of basic humanity in some pretty base humans there are lines even drunken little people should not cross even medieval tower docents can go too far elephants do not belong in towers and pompous canadians do get their beaks bent occasionally hookers it turns out may be found in brothels how bizarre but strangely real this film is unfortunately as seems to be the case in reality the innocent victims are incidental because the guilty ones are so much more interesting the real question asked by great film is who are we this movie asks us again from a fresh perspectivecolin farrell finally cast well fine acting throughout 95 out of ten for pacing a modern masterwork near poetic lets see what our new film maker does next his own will be a hard act to follow,black_comedy
the trailer for this film would suggest fair like 2007s shoot em blood bath with a bit dark sense of humor instead this film is totally different no fast killing starts off this film but a bit of profanity and a strangely tortured main character named ray who is supposedly a hit man things do not become crystal clear until about midway and then things take off crescendos to a slambang finish full of blood but that is not what makes the film what makes the film is its bitingly sharp sense of black humor where characters are mean to those around them trying to get away from their own problems i never thought i would come away impressed by a colin farrell film but this film made me immensely mirthful and laugh hard than i have for a while over this winter season of films it is sad but has a nice message packaged inside which takes its time to get to the surface,black_comedy
i wasnt going to review this but a recent rash of award nominations together with encouragement from people like barry norman the uk film critic provokes it a characteristically attractive central performance by brendan gleeson too good for this material and at least competent performances by farrell and fiennes conceal the profound moral emptiness and cynicism at the heart of this film which blatantly attempts to assemble the components of a cult hit add a dash of tarantino dialogue the comic cinematic dwarf from living in oblivion the psychopathic geezergangster from sexy beast even the title is probably a steal though in different circumstances it could have been quite a funny one american readers should know that there is a satirical magazine in the uk called private eye a bit like your onion and in private eye there is a running joke about an imaginary film called they flew to bruges which successfully captures everything about the sort of worthy and desperately unglamorous blackandwhite 1950s war film that you might doze off to on a sunday afternoons tellybut look it takes more than adding a few effs and jeffs to the dialogue to make you tarantino you have to have an ear for real speech to make this work all we get here is just pointless foulmouthedness but with not one memorable or quotable line in the whole thing compare this to for example armando ianuccis the thick of it a tv political satire where a character hovering in a doorway is told to come the f in or f the f off now thats funny creative swearing in its just depressing and relentless still the director and producers are enormously proud of their pottymouths as they devote a whole dvd extra to counting the instances oh grow up is the only response i can musterthese three central characters are two hit men and their psycho boss gleesons character can remain appealing enough as we are told little enough about the hard realities of his background but farrell the ostensible lead with whom we are supposed to sympathise is on the run this isnt a spoiler as its clear early on because of a hit thats gone wrong resulting in the death of an innocent child a choirboy no less still any moral qualms one might have about rooting for these dangerous sociopaths can be conveniently be put to one side because the hit that went wrong was on a priest who had been interfering with children a paedo so thats alright then never mind that their more normal business is enforcing with violence the trades of prostitution and protection and drugs not to mention narcissistic concepts of respect he was attempting to shoot a paedo so the collateral killing of a child is just another comic blunderas for the denouement which i dont need and cant be botheredto introduce spoiler warnings for preposterous just preposterous if the contrived ending had introduced some moral shape even if just a subversive or nihilistic one to the proceedings there might have been some redemptive power instead all it does is just emphasise the cynical way in which the ingredients including the calculated taunting of imagined political correctness have been mixed together not to mention their sheer implausibilitynot clever not funny not original not satirical not cuttingedge or black comedy not even realistic just a nasty taste in the mouth,black_comedy
martin mcdonoughs with the dream casting of colin farrell and brendan gleeson as bumbling hitman and seasoned hitman who flee to the beautiful city of the title after farrell botches a hit the pair take in all the sights the beautiful city has to offer the rest of the film chronicles farrells wayward romance with a beautiful drug dealer who supplies film crews with drugs there is an amusing subplot which farrell befriends a diminutive actor who is making a eurotrash film on location the villain of this film is ralph fiennes who literary phones in his performance his role is very like a take off of sir ben kingsley in  sexy beast gleeson receives orders to take do away with his protg but failing to do so only incurs the wrath of fienneswho travels to bruges for an overtly bloody shootoutthe downside to this film is the overuse of strong language which is evidently used in a conversation with ralph fiennes and gleeson its usage is akin to a swearing contest how many times do we have to hear the dreaded c word uttered in the space of one minute almost twelve one of the funny moments which at least tries for laughs is farrells berating of an obese american family who are offended by his remarks regarding their weight the scene is amateurish in its staging and would best suit the cutting room floor or deleted scene section on the dvd unfortunately the shoot em up climax is marred with a downbeat shoot em up climax which feature some of the most realistic gunshot wounds ever committed to celluloid sam peckinpah would be proud gorehounds will not be disappointed with the liberal overuse of blood and gore which seem left over from a previous film albeit of an eli roth nature witness brendan gleeson fall from the tower a bit over the top but nevertheless very well done i was reasonably entertained by this but feel that the filmmakers could of toned down the content instead of going all the way to eleven gorehounds will be pleased everyone else will probably have a sour taste in their mouths for a better buddybuddy pairing theres 48 hrs midnight run,black_comedy
horrible gratuitous violence shallow plot horrible acting non flemings pretending to be flemish every scene degenerates into some kind of bar fight the only thing going for the movies is that it is filmed in brugges but that is the only thing flemish about it of course there are the stereotypical fat americans in the first brugges brawl scene one of many more americanscanadians in the second or third restaurant brawl scene had i seen this in a theater i would have walked out but in my own home i had a morbid fascination at how this preadolescent type plot would work out and how many more sick acts of gratuitous violence could be added into one shallow plot save your time and money and go play grand theft auto or go watch a claude van damme movie if this kind of twisted misanthropic garbage gets you off,black_comedy
its hard to believe that martin mcdonagh hadnt written or directed on the big screen before this title his brilliant writing allows a dark and complex drama to have comical moments and it doesnt come across as too busy and is easy to keep up with colin farrell is superb as is brendon gleeson and ralph fiennes britisirish filmaking at its very best,black_comedy
i wouldnt say this is a movie you should definitely watch but i will say this if you somehow convince yourself to watch this you wouldnt be disappointedthe most amazing thing was the soundtrack and the screenplay which seemed surreal,black_comedy
as roger ebert has put fantastically if this movie doesnt affect you in anyway it will urge you to visit belgium and its brugesi love how this movie now seems like an offensive film on many levels the terms said and things shown in this movie can be very politically incorrectwhat i liked about the movie is that even the unnecessary scenes in this movie are delightful the story itself is very clever and the way its told is clever as well the morality involved in this movie is quite challenging and influencing even the lowest of the low have standards in their ethics this can be seen in many significant moments of the moviei loved the brutally real comedy in the movie its not that it is meant to be a comedy but it is funny just how life itself is loyalty is the other great element in this movie and somehow i feel is the same as the standardsthe most important elements in the movie i think are survival instincts and selfimage after watching this movie youll have some questions about life and this is how powerful the movie is acting is adequately good and the music is just fit for such landscapes,black_comedy
farrell does a fine job of playing a hitman caught up in conflict of conscience little more can be said,black_comedy
its interesting to see martin mcdonaghs first film with the hindsight of his two other movies while i missed 2008 back when it came out i have recently enjoyed seven psychopaths 2012 and three billboards outside ebbing missouri 2017 having now seen all three of mcdonaghs films i see the themes and motifs he uses throughout his directing i already had hints of these common elements its just that seeing for the first time has cemented them from using short people to drug use to some uncomfortable violence mcdonagh has a style all his own and it clearly shows in his breakout filmi think what draws me to mcdonaghs films is his expert use of multiple chekovs guns as well as tying all these various foreshadowings together in a satisfying way whether its a fat american spare change or the untimely death of a child each part of was included for a purpose that becomes evident in some truly genius twists along the way some may say that the ambiguity of the endings of his movies is frustrating but i almost like the openended conclusions that seem to say and life goes onwhile i did enjoy it still had some areas where mcdonagh eventually improved through his continued filmmaking even though they spoke english half the time i couldnt understand what was being said by the actors this almost caused me to turn on closed captions for some semblance of subtitles other than that the dark comedy helped to balance the deeply dramatic plot as it centered around death in its many forms i was already a fan of mcdonaghs films but helps to confirm that the mcdonagh trilogy is one of the best pieces of filmmaking to happen in the last decadea fantastic first film in the mcdonagh trilogy i give 45 stars out of 5,black_comedy
i stumbled across this gem on netflix and had never heared about it before was a very pleasant surprise and its a shame i did not see this movie when it came out 10 years ago very good characters and an interesting plot thatwell that does end somehowi will not spoil you lets just sayit reminded me of some tarantino moviesgo see it its great,black_comedy
is the directorial debut of irish director martin mcdonagh who has recently become known for dramadies such as seven psychopaths and three billboards outside ebbing missourimcdonagh has written and directed a brilliant film balancing tonal extremes masterfully it contains hilarious comedy dark emotional moments and graphic violence yet none ever feels out of place all these elements are balanced with skillthe hitmen portryed by colin farrel and brendan gleason are developed subtly as the story progresses ralph fiennes also delivers a fiercely profane hilariously entertaining performance as their uncompromising boss the setting of bruges is used by mcdonagh with precision introducing its aspects subtly throughout the script with later payoffs such as the tower and canal by the time the climactic action takes place we already know the town of bruges and its basic geography as well as the characterssimilarly to mcdonaghs other films he does not shy away from extremities in the script characters say things which you would not usually hear in a film making them feel more realistic and also hilarious although definitely not to everyone i definitely found it extremely funny with smarter comedy than most actual straight comedy films that are released currently,black_comedy
dark humor lovable tortured characters witty dialogue tearinducing drama its cliche but this is my favorite movie of all time so far also check out the guard and seven psychopaths for other films by this director,black_comedy
not necessarily your favorite but too smart and original to forget really like anything else plus great performances,black_comedy
love it love it love it love ita very british movie only brits can pull off such great mix of comedy and sadness and of course world renoun british humour i will definitely watch it again,black_comedy
i was really surprised by the storyline because of the way the humour was also gathered up in a natural way really i just wanted to say what i have said on the title thats all really was expecting a comedy mixed crime thriller but was pleasantly surprised with the good story cheers from sri lanka would like to visit bruges some day,black_comedy
to grosse pointe blanki have long been waiting for another hilarious but dark and bloody comedy like thisfinally rode to bruges after seeing the movie,black_comedy
was a movie that took its time to really sink its teeth into me it began as a slow chilledout meander around bruges the belgian town in which the movie is set that was interspersed with a bit of witty backandforth from the two main protagonists a couple of irish hitmen preparing to deal with the fallout after a job gone wrong whilst the setting of bruges was interesting in and of itself i wasnt used to a movie focusing on so little for so long however by the time that the stakes were ratcheted up in the second half of the movie i noticed that i had connected with the characters on a level that surprised me of course this was largely down to the excellent cast the two main characters ray played by colin farrell and ken played by brendan gleeson have good chemistry and make their flawed characters endearing and relatable some credit should also be given to the writers the cast were given great lines to work with admittedly i found the comedic tone a little strange especially the weird midget jokes but it works when it counts and the movie successfully uses humour to explore the inner demons of the hitmen without trivialising their emotions a more conventional movie would opt out of taking the opportunity to poke fun of its protagonists emotional turmoil but thats what makes the movie so refreshing it strikes a balance between humour and thoughtfulness and gets it mostly right adding a breath of fresh air to an already pretty unique movie i say mostly as the plot gets more and more ridiculous as it goes on events start of quite tame but soon bruges opens up as its unconvincing locals introduce themselves and devolve into unconvincing plot devices it was good for a few good laughs but felt very lazy and pulled me out of the moviesaying that i still enjoyed the film the cast did a good job of holding the movie up as the plot began to thin near the climax overall the entire feel of is very unconventional and while it is lacking in areas its setting characters and humour are still a welcome step back from typical hollywood blockbusters,black_comedy
whilst the start of the film is somewhat slow and unconvincing this sets the tone for the rest of the film and a great tone at that collin farrell and brendan gleeson have great chemistry as the two hitman friends whilst ralf fiennes is exceptional in his role as the psychopathic boss the funny moments are set up by earlier comments and the ridiculous moments almost seem plausible thanks to the consistent altreality tone of the film and the great work of collin farrell and ralf fiennes to support this the script is unapologetic in its potential for offense but well crafted and with great hidden meaning in the metaphors of purgatory etc overall this is a fun and relatively original film well worth a watch,black_comedy
i watched this film when it came out in 2008 with a friend and at the end we both said that was fantastic was it not and i said i do not think i have seen a film like this for a long time as it was so good in fact i liked the locations so much i have visited three times to bruges and love the place i am going for my birthday in april and can not wait i got started in trying to get a sequel made as feel a story can be told have got back that no time soon does martin mcdonagh have plans for a sequel but i saw a video of colin farrell saying joe meets colin farrell to talk the lobster harry potter and a sequel to i hear colin farrell asked about who he could play and he says ray film when asked about a sequel he says oh brendan not ready in my mind meaning as brendan gleeeson has been writing something else that he might be interested in writing a sequel martin mcdonagh holds the writes if a film is done again but i am sure as he knows colin and brendan well that just be what colin farrell meant in his comments to show your interest please look at this you tube video any way i think colin farrell is the best performance he has ever given and brendan gleeson and ralph fiennes are superb also ever one in the film give a really good performance and bruges itself comes off really well in the film,black_comedy
you know you have a great film when you can reflect on moral issues and blend kickass action with pitchperfect original writing at the same time martin mcdonaghs is an instant classic a kind of film thats enjoyable throughout and delivers all the great jabs of a black comedy guiltstricken after a job gone wrong hitman ray colin farrell and his partner ken brendan gleeson await orders from their ruthless boss belgium the last place in the world ray wants to be colin ferrell and brendan gleeson are a acting duo from heaven bopth men give stellar performances of men facing midlife crisis who end up getting themselves in a hell of a lot more than they bargained for gleeson and ferrell makes every scene entertaining and do it with the kind of natural talent than few actors posses martin mcdonaghs script is filled with original content that stays grounded in certain themes but is liberal in what itll do to the audience its the kind of film that you shake your head all throughout but will walk out of with a grin on your face due to the richness and keen originality that you barely get to see in movies these days,black_comedy
i was looking forward to seeing this movie the plot sounded really funny and im happy to say that it didnt disappoint has an interesting plot two hit men are sent to await orders in the city of bruge after killing their last target the only thing is that ray the main character hates bruge it goes deeper than that but i dont want to spoil anything the plot is good and thankfully martin mcdonagh knew what to do with it the characters end up being one of the major driving forces of the movie ray himself goes a lot deeper than expected despite this the movie never takes itself too seriously rays always got something to whine about and its great fun to watch the other characters are good too but ray especially as mentioned above the movie is very funny its a comedy though so youd hope so but the jokes while random and weird still make sense in the context for the most part they arent just random noises or phrases they actually fit which is nice the movie is paced quite well too despite pulling off a 107 run time not a whole lot happened thinking back on it but it never felt rushed or too slowoverall is great fun while still managing to stand as a great film its funny with great characters a great plot and great pacing its all around just a great movie id recommend this movie to basically anyone so long as you have a good and a little dark sense of humor,black_comedy

i bought this dvd after viewing it once a few months back i must admit my judgment was wrong fails utterly to align its two conflicting urges to be maudlin and to be shocking its very amateurish as an alternate take on the hitman movie it goes places the others dont but its not terribly interesting it feels like a gay hitman soap opera paid for by the belgium tourism council the voiceover intro which dispenses with the reason theyre in one line  before the movie even starts  is just pitiful the two hitmen hug they cry they mope im gay and this movie makes me squirm its about as much fun as watching two sulking gay guys pass the time while they iron out their relationship over a vacation its too elegiac and subdued to be much fun and too puerile to be much of a guilty pleasureauthor mcdonagh revels in foul language but doesnt find much glee in it and the movie becomes a clunky ever more meaningless actionmovieclichmachine for the last half hour postsexy beast villains are all the same here its raelph fiennes the angry midget gag is stolen from lost in oblivion,black_comedy
the fault of this movie rests entirely on the script there is a reason that movies are usually written by one person and directed by another the collaboration tends to heal the weaknesses that each side brings to the project in brugges was made without collaboration the acting is great the cinematography is great the soundtrack what there is of it is great the story is just written and directed in such a amateurish manner that the experience becomes an hour long wait for the big finish that is spelled out so completely in the overdone foreshadowing that all surprise and excitement is lost think of it as going out for dinner on your birthday and being told on the way that it is a surprise party then being told who will be there and finally being told exactly what present each person bought for you  all before you even open the door to hear surprise it doesnt matter how good the party and gifts are the experience is ruined,black_comedy
where to start with this film is a strange little film combining as it does comedy and violence there is much to like about this film but a lot more dislike colin farrell is excellent as the guilt ridden hitman ray much of the dialogue with his partner ken played by brendan gleeson is smart and funny and the premise of two hit men stranded in random place has potential i particularly liked the economy of rays opening voiceover that sets the scene for the film on reflection the things i like about this film are the things that the writer  director martin mcdonagh may have brought from his theatrical background what i disliked about this film spoiler coming is what mcdonagh does with the films story that grows ever more preposterous and unbelievable as the movie goes on what really starts to grate is the reliance on coincidence to drive the narrative and how the director simply brings characters together without explanation a case in point would be chloeys psycho boyfriend being present in a scene where yuri the russian gun dealer sells harry a gun what is the boyfriend doing here and low and behold as the movie drifts towards its climax he appears again quite randomly to assist harry in tracking down ken with the line that goes something like he went that a way it is desperate stuff and totally unbelievable and there are many more moments like this towards the end they meet jimmy the dwarf walking to work on a film set already in costume jimmy is playing a school boy and so him being in costume allows another totally absurd plot twist to develop as a film maker mcdonagh should know that actors dont walk to work and they certainly dont turn up already in costume and finally mcdonaghs use of cinematic violence is particularly infuriating and rather than recommend tarantino to mcdonagh to show how it should be done i would tell him to see funny games instead the violence that mcdonagh uses to get a laugh and tell the story is movie violence it is violence without consequence and pain the sort that hollywood has been peddling since day one but then again perhaps i should have seen it cominga movie about hit men thats bound to lead to gun dealer called yuri living in a big eccentric house and a beautiful drug dealer stick up artist living in a gorgeous apartment where people pick up and point guns without checking to see if they are loaded  or where you can buy a gun without actually handing over the money this is the world of movie violence where a woman being punched in the face raises a laugh and where a hit mans first job is to kill a priest it is totally stupid and more unforgivably quite boring mr mcdonagh hollywood awaits,black_comedy
after they make a hit in england 2 killers flee to bruges belgium where the violence really beginsthis picture really makes absolutely no sense and eventually becomes nothing more than a blood bathwhen colin farrell is ordered to kill a priest a young innocent also takes a bullet and for the rest of the film collin farrell begs for redemption for what he has donean hour into this horrific film ralph fiennes shows up as their boss and orders ken to kill the farrell characterwe also have a zeljo ivanek taking a blank bullet to the eye and revenge and all other sorts of mayhemken takes a plunge off a building and thats really disgusting at bestmore shooting more mayhem and we dare to call this black comedy,black_comedy
in january 1993 i sat in a cambridge cinema and watched an ok movie  not great but ok it was called reservoir dogs and i am still watching rubbish homages cum lazy rip offs of that socalled groundbreaking movie  is the latest and it is pretty poor yes the first fifty minutes are ok in a breezy comic sort of way as a couple of hit men try to come to terms with being exiled after a botched job then it tries to mix serious with comic and completely collapses so that even an excellent brendan glesson cannot save once again a director who has had praise for his first film makes a turkey but the critics cannot go back on their first impressions  witness the absolute rubbish that tarantino has been turning out since his debut so ralph fiennes sporting the worst cockney accent since dick van dyke its too posh even for mockney arrives to kill colin farrell spending hours walking around with a gun firing indiscriminately at the tourists with not a policeman in sight i kid you not unbelievable dont care about the characters writing that should not grace a ten year olds nativity play and swearing that merely becomes tiresome well done film four thank you for such terrible cr,black_comedy
mcdonough tries to make a lot of comedic hay out of having farrell punch out ugly americans who have the temerity to spend their tourist dollars the uk audience that this movie is aimed at ostensibly draws great satisfaction from seeing american fatsos and american women punched in the face  all while farting their way through too many pints o bitter no doubtbut the same americans who have the money to travel abroad to the uk for example are the ones who spend 160 per seat at one of mcdonoughs crappy broadway showshasnt mcdonough made enough money from americans to avoid repeatedly insulting us ill be sure not to give him any more of my money nor my time and attentionincidentally this genius dramatist might rethink the comedic premise of which entails the story of a hit man who has accidentally murdered a little boy might want to refresh the old mfa in dramatic writing there martinjust because is stupid and repulsive doesnt make it art although if 300 morons have given this movie a 100 perhaps mcdonough does actually know his audience,black_comedy

this is my first comment on imdb after visiting it nearly every day for two years i felt the need to write something because when i found out that this was the only long film of mcdonagh i felt rather disappointed i was entranced by the sophistication of the film im a filmaholic who watches at least one film everyday what was so extraordinary with that allured me so much was it the music the city of bruges the characters or the humor which does not use cheap jokes i really could not answer that question to myself although i am a 4 year psychology student i also feel a need to say something about colin farrell i have seen some of his previous films in all of them he tries to draw a male charisma like many pert hollywood actors do but in this film he becomes a real human being with all his weaknesses now i started to respect him as a successful and modest actor i hope mcdonagh is reading these comments because i really want many more films from him i will be following you mcdonagh of course there will be some people who do not like your work but if you continue to shoot your films in your original way you will have your fans like me thank you very much for all your efforts so far,black_comedy
occasionally the accents are a bit thick and the fword is used a bit gratuitously for my taste but aside from that i loved this movie has first rate performances a well written script a lovely locale i thought bruges was adorable fascinating characters and most importantly a lot of heart this movie accomplishes the difficult task of enabling the viewer to connect emotionally with murderers however the movie never becomes sappy thanks to again great acting and emotionally powerful scenes that are shot and directed wellcolin farrell is an acting powerhouse nice work by all the main players a highly recommended very entertaining film see it,black_comedy
all i knew before watching this movie are the actors that are in it i like all the actors involved and i thought that this might be a good movie to watch but i really had no big expectations but i was surprised at the end is a really good movie with great dialogs and great actors and what i cannot forget to mention brilliant photography that presents us all bruges there is no panoramic scene same like others just great movie is in some things similar to the matador there weve got only brosnan shining in not so good movie but here weve got farrell  co shining in very good movie i must admit that i didnt expect such a good performance from farrell after disappointing alexander ask the dust and miami vice at least disappointing to me so about the scriptmovie is about two professional killers ken brendan gleeson and ray colin farrell who come on some sort of vacation there they must keep low profile and wait for the further instructions of their boss harry ralph fiennes as the movie goes on we found out that ray is troubled by his first job he accidentally killed a young boy while he was trying to kill his target because of that hes got suicidal thoughts and one more thing ray really dislikes bruges his older partner ken is enjoying and its culture with all that old houses churches towers and canals ray meets chlo on set of the movie that took place in central of bruges but soon ken is given instructions to kill ray because of his incident with the little boyis first long movie of martin mcdonagh mcdonagh wrote a fine scenario where he puts one younger and older killer in front and fills the movie with big doses of dark humor mostly coming from ray who acts sarcastic about everything and nice turn in a story i must say that the ending is quite unexpected its not american happy ending where everybody lives happy after thats why this movie is so good with message that you must follow your principals and with lots of irony humor and strange events like dwarf war also mcdonagh presents his characters like ordinary people with all their problems but whats most important is that he managed to combine humor and human tragedy ray falls in love but he must be punished because he killed a child in a way that at the end you feel sorry for main characters even though there is no completely positive character only that little boy so is not a movie for everybody if you expect action comedy look somewhere else cause this movie has a big touch of drama and makes you think about it great debut for mcdonagh one of the best roles for farrell and great movie for me and i hope for all of you,black_comedy
very close from being a masterpiece is one of this years greatest and probably one of the decades as wellalthough i was never aware of where bruges was i fit right between both main characters sympathy for the place the film deals with the duality of these two killers and their disparities of how they will find their self redemptionthe elements of the film are constantly ambiguous by intention providing moments of extreme seriousness inside sensitive matters and eventually creating boost of laughters across tense momentsall the characters are built to hug and kiss and kill you in their own way the lines given by the actors are pure brilliancy and are intelligently spoken by the script read duality and ambiguous for given and spokeni am desperately trying to remember a movie as good as but right now all i can think is monsieur hire by patrice leconte to compare with this one as far as its deepness and simplicity to story telli believe this film will get some serious attention this year for it has the right look of a winner with the heart of a happy loser read winner and loser as least competitive as you canenjoy this beauty,black_comedy
i worked in europe in the eighties and have been to bruges during christmas time the town is as charming as the movie portrays however sitting outside in a cafe that time of the year drinking beer as seen in the film adds to the charm but in fact is a bit much even for hearty europeansthe movie was excellent and a pleasant surprise for me colin farrell and brendon gleason were perfect together but then gleason is spot on in almost every film he does eg gangs of new yorkother than having some difficulty understanding farrells irish brogue this movie was a pleasant surprise for me i thought it combined the right combination of humor and reality making the plot line more convincing i particularly liked the role of the pregnant hotel owner friendly business like and feisty a woman of characterfn,black_comedy
as much as i like british movies the cast and black comedies left me unsatisfied it wasnt enough that colin farrell gave one of his best performances since tiger land and that brendan gleeson was casted superbly for the supporting role the plot progresses enjoyably in the pleasing scenery of bruges and the relationship between the two contract killersray and ken played by farrell and gleeson respectivelyis amusing but thats just it the plot is enjoyable not stirring or inspiring and the dialogue is amusing not funny or witty all in all its an enjoyable flick thats fun to watch but thats it,black_comedy
if the three most important things in real estate are location location and location the three most important things in a great film are dialog dialog and dialog has dialog up the wazoo there havent been this many black comedy oneliners in one film since pulp fiction all three of the principal actors are superb with each revealing new facets of their talents i had not suspected before even though i know their work well most impressive in a way is colin farrell finally rescued from the handsome male lead ghetto and given some lines to really chew on and chew he doeshis ray makes up for with scathing wit what he lacks in subtlety the subtlety belongs to brendan gleeson who manages to transcend both his character kens profession hit man and his background to explore the art culture and philosophy that he finds ray thinks bruges is hell ken finds it a kind of heaven and the third surprise in this film is ralph fiennes a very very different ralph fiennes than we see in his handsome male lead ghetto rolesmartin mcdonagh has been called the most famous oscarwinning director youve never heard of based on his win for a short called six shooter ive seen that film and its even darker in its way than but its that irish kind of dark that is full of humor black humor admittedly but humor nonetheless and like pulp fiction if you can get beyond the surface characters and what they are and what they do for a living and focus on what theyre saying the humor is sidesplitting i snorted milk through my nose at rays theyre filming midgets and at several other lines i havent had so much fun listening to two hit men talk since jules and vincent and the big kahuna burger,black_comedy
whenever i went to the theater no matter the movie would be one of the previews truthfully not being a big fan of colin i was getting very sick of seeing it but after hearing all the good word i decided to buck up and check it out and damn this was a real good flickstory focuses on two hit men who are sent to a beautiful and culture rich city in belgium known as bruges theyre both to stay put and keep a low profile until they hear word from their boss harrybruges is a gorgeous quaint looking city with canals and cobblestone roads one would think anyone would love to spend time here but this isnt the case with this odd couple the two men both share a profession but not tastes and this is where some really nice humor plays in one appreciates life the other not so much the story focuses on why these two see life in different manners which really gives the film some great character development and this is where the movie shines best in its two leading men and their banter with one another from just talking about beer or how silly something is to serious issues of death and the afterlife its all very entertaining which makes the movie move at a fast cliplike any other flick with irish actors youve got the silly observational type humor the thick as a brick accents and the motormouth way of speaking its all good but i have a tough time hearingunderstanding them quite a bit if youre like me this is just a warning to keep your ears openwas a surprisingly good flick with great performances by the two leads and two supporting actors being the characters harry and jimmy the others like rays girly were nothing special she really just felt like a model thrown into the mix besides that anyone who enjoys a wellwritten flick a little blood and some taboo themes should definitely check it out,black_comedy
this movie was great not so much that the town of bruges was perfect or that collin ferrell finally got to use his irish accent and was actually pretty good it was the writing and directing of this film that made it better than the average action comedy mcdonaugh fantastic job the quick and witty use of words and the ability of ferrel fiennes and gleeson to adapt from their normal acting to take on these characters was unbelievable even the sharp cut transitions that mcdonaugh used allowed the movie to move smoothly bottom line fantasticcccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc ccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc ccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc ccccccccccc sorry i needed ten lines,black_comedy
clearly this film was influenced by pulp fiction and lock stock and two smoking barrels really funnyi guess some people find humor in the fbomb being dropped and some dont and with the exception of the remake of the ladykillers i guess i find that to be funny as others have noted all the acting performances are greati happened to think farrell did the best job but one could make the successful argument that gleason and fiennes did just as good if not better great snappy dialoguehad it gone too far it would have been too overthetop like in juno but it was reigned in just enough to make it delightful how any professional critics are deriding this film is beyond me they should be fired from their gig for being so clueless,black_comedy
great film i watched this in a packed movie theater in the usa and although parts of the dialogue are a bit near the mark for the american audience and certain jokes are aimed squarely at the british  irish audience it went down very wella very original take on a good story all performances were excellent the script can seem a little cheesy at first but once it gets flowing its very natural and very well written and performed seamlesslycolin is excellent probably his best role i would say the only slight negative is that arry ralph fiennes character is rather too similar to don logan ben kingsleys character in sexy beast however this isnt a bad thing as both characters work well its just a shame i couldnt stop myself comparing themmy wife and i really enjoyed its very very funny throughout with moments of real subtle dry comedy genius plus moments of in your face humour its also bittersweet romantic violent briefly offensive to some occasionally shocking and upsetting but hugely enjoyable and very well doneoverall a very strong 9  10 for a great independent movie deserves a lot more success than i expect it will get,black_comedy
i saw last night and to be honest im still struggling with it a bit the trailer for the film is misleading as it makes it look like one of those fun sassy guy ritchie style movies about a couple of quirky hit men hiding out well the dialogue is tarantinoesquire sharp and very funny but the trailer gives no hints whatsoever to the darkness of the material lurking in the alcoves of this film the violence is intense and disturbing both thematically and visually this is not a light comedy for kids i would hesitate about letting teenagers see it as well i know a lot of people have been desensitized to violence and i have too to a large degree tarantino does violence like a kid playing with plastic army toys in the backyard you know hes just splashing fake blood all over everything so you never really invest all that much weight to it but the violence in is realistic and visceral in a way that seems much too dark intense and serious for the comedy it introduces itself as the characters take the violence and associated guilt and consequences seriously as well i cant tell if the director intended for the drama to be as serious as the comedy is funny or if the actors he brought together on screen are simply way too talented and played it too straight then again the darkness of the demon is much too serious to play it any other wayfarrell plays the guiltridden ray to macbeth perfection craving distraction in the form of drink drugs and women to avoid facing his freshly minted demons and twitching with discomfort at his exile in the calm sleepy bucolic bruges a place tailor made for quiet reflection he is literally squirming with frustration boredom and remorse like a 10 year old kid in church his rapport with brendon gleeson is delightful easy and funny a patient older brotheryounger brother dynamic gleesons ken finds an inspired serenity to the city and his reflection on rays plight brings forth a strong conviction of compassion for the younger man the dichotomy that plays between their characters as bruges presents itself as one mans heaven and another mans hell is genuine and interesting as a comedy the film is sassy and delightfully fun as a drama the film is dark and unexpectedly movingly dramatic but combining both of these tones into one film left me feeling a bit confused as to how to feel what ray did was bad real bad it was hard to abandon myself to the sassy silliness of the comedy given the darkness of the dirty deeds i felt guilty laughing at the jokes and regardless of how charming farrell is i still felt conflicted about sympathizing with ray movie goers with a thicker skin will enjoy it tremendously i find myself wondering why the guys who can make this truly hip fresh funny stuff cant leave out all the blood and demons for once and just let me kick back and enjoy,black_comedy
a friend of mine saw this before i did and said it was a strange thing but he found colin farrells performance awardworthyit is a strange thinghas martin mcdonagh of the brilliant plays made the transition to film successfullyas both writer and director yes and no is a little gembut with the emphasis on little the squabbling gangster duo and their boss the violence and the feisty dialogue recall tarantino so does the fun with political incorrectness but mcdonagh hasnt the flair or cinematic richness of tarantino at his best the filmmaking is adept the direction is excellent the images are surprisingly dark and handsome but the miseenscene is tame in fact very much is made of how boring though beautiful and perfectly preserved the belgian city of bruges is though it is in a sense all about the diaogue which sparkles startles and amuses the material is simple the dialogue doesnt open up mindblowing and astonishing worlds as does that of pillowman the play that mcdonagh himself thinks has set the highest standard of his worksa novice hitman working in london ray farrell botches his first hit hes sent to bruges with his pal ken brendan gleeson later their boss harry ralph fiennes enters the scene along the way theres a pretty girl a film set a dwarf ken and ray meet on the set a hotel clerk an antiquarian named yuri eric godon who dispenses guns a skinhead and tourists whom ray insults thinking they are americanmcdonagh has fun with bruges the most perfectly preserved medieval city in all of belgium it does make a nice setting for a movie if a largely static one like a stage set but in 3d but bruges is something you can do better in a movie its beauties wouldnt translate to the stage best to go there and film them its ironic that a couple of irish hit men with an englishh boss should be stuck there and for a while mcdonagh is content with riffing on that you dont need much for his kind of verbal comedy the irish have such a way with words look at what beckettt could do with two bums on a bare stagemcdonagh has said the source of this movie was a visit to bruges he made himself he enjoyed the tourist sites for a day or so and then he was done with the culture and wanted some fun to get drunk as hes put it in interviews and get laid ken and ray embody the two sides of his experience ken is for the culture and ray whos not interested in history its just a lot of stuff thats already happened he says is for funthis is good for laughs i almost wrote laffs but underlying the story is a terrible scene we actually vividly witness in which ray kills an innocent bystander for which he is tormented by guilt its this cockup that leads to the duos furlough in balgium eventually after the boss comes in theres a lot of blood laughs and blood are two things martin mcdonagh knows how to deliver in a devastating onetwo punchthere also has been by then a knockout and a blast in the face and a coke party in which the dwarf whos a movie actor from america predicts a coming war between blacks and whites in which you wont have to take sides youll have no choicesthe success of all this in a film shows that martin mcdonagh is a slick operator it doesnt show ifwhether on the screen or on the stagehe is going to sustain the genius he showed when he wrote seven plays in a year or so nine years ago another thing it does showis that colin farrell whos turned away from his popularization by hollywood has perfect pitch for this kind of thing and can go from scornful to desperate without losing his puppydog charm girls still go wild for his black moth eyebrows the american critics dont seem to have been terribly impressed by however it is a fine performance but a minor one as a filmyou will enjoy it more i should think if you have not seen the us trailer for it which as so unfortunately and so often happens nowadays presents six or seven or eight of the key scenes of the movie with the best dialogue zingers culled out of them in a row so that as you watch the movie especially if youve been subjected to the same trailer five times as i was youll find yourself haplessly ticking the scenes off as they appear in context and because the tone is so right in mcdonaghs writing and especially when farrell is talking but fiennes and gleeson and the others are all extremely good each of these zingers encapsulates a big chunk of the movie and this kills all the freshness of it i wish movie promoters would stop doing this its a virtual crime they should be sent to bruges and made to stay there forever,black_comedy
i just watched the premier of this movie at a special screening and i must admit that i loved it one of the best movies i have seen in a long time storyline was very interesting along with some very strong performances colin farrell proved that he can act if given a chance and in my opinion he should get an oscar nomination for his role his comedy was at its best ralph fienes was great in a supporting role and he should also get a nomination for his performance the ending is very unpredictable as i was not expecting what is going to happeni recommend this movie to everybody so go watch it and enjoy this great movie,black_comedy
hmmthis film had received such a lot of acclaim i really wanted to follow suit and love it toono doubt it has some quotable gaffs  and the roguish guy richieesquire characters certainly entertain  but i didnt even begin to engage in what turned out to be a thoroughly lukewarm bit of storytelling the thing is really wants to have charm and it desperately wants to bear the chicness of finer british classics i feel it fails on both accountsgive it a rent if youre bored one night but dont expect to emerge bedazzled as some would have you believe,black_comedy
at first glance of the dvd case of i didnt think much of itbut by the end of the film i have just one thing to say that is one of the best films ive ever seenthe story is a great mix of humour and darkness about two hit men hiding out its in belgium who come to terms with their past and deaththis is the best film so far with colin farrel who plays the young hitman and gleeson is superb as the more experienced of the two also ralph finnes is great as the foul mouthed gang leader whos out to level the scores and the rest of the cast is brilliant such as yuri the yoga gun salesmen and jimmy the racist dwarfall in all watch this film and make your own mind up but i loved every minute of it,black_comedy
well i was expecting this to be a typical irish style of comedy but it is understandable in every language the movie is shot in the beautiful bruges which i have visited many times since i am from hollandmy favorite scene is where the fat man tries to see the tower and meets collin farrel downstairs i have not laughed so much in years the funny thing is that all the political and stereotype incorrect statements are brought in a very humorous way my colleague watched it as well and turned the movie off halfway i guess he did not understand the humouri wish more movies are made like this i regard it in the same class as pulp fiction,black_comedy
imagine christmas in a medieval european town complete with cathedrals graceful swans gently gliding along on a river  a fairyland  as one character describes the setting for a film starring colin farrell bredan gleeson and joseph fiennes yet before we get too comfortable with the view dont forget were talking about a colin farrell movie here the fairyland setting begins to ring false almost from the moment our two mismatched characters ken and ray stumble into bruges a quaint little town in belgium ken and ray have been abruptly ordered by their boss harry to lay low following a routine hit gone very wrong for two weeks as the boys settle into their hotel sharing a room instead of being in separate rooms even we get the hint that nothing will be going quite the way either of them wants i must say that colin farrells rawready portrayal of a tightly wound wouldbe hit man gives me renewed faith in his talents and his current career choices apparently so did the golden globes 2009 as a man running from his boss his past misdeeds and his failed life farrells performance commands us to feel more deeply for ray than he may actually feel for himself awash in overwhelming guilt and remorse for an accident cloaked within a heinous crime ray careens through his involuntary vacation of highbrow culture and lowlifes for which his partner and friend ray must woefully shoulder ray played by brenden gleeson serves as a steady counterpoint to his strungout partner gleeson is a quiet marvel of studied selfcontrol his ray is at once genial and halfmocking only to reveal a kindred ranting soul seething at the injustices of his world which forces him to make unpleasant choices that he cant neatly rationalize and would rather not face at all a deft supporting cast and subtle directing blend to lift this sharp little indie film to a threereeler for me the only weakness for is the screenplay which at time wants to bludgeon us with the sin vs redemption theme overandoverandover again the triteness of harrys final act almost ruins rays bittersweet hope for his future for us,black_comedy
the idea of a film about a couple of foulmouthed irish hit men laying low after one of them has accidentally killed a child in a church doesnt sound like a barrel of laughs but there are plenty of laugh out loud moments in this black comedythe two men are ken the older of the two who loves the culture and history in the ancient town and ray who thinks two weeks stuck is like purgatory ray is having difficulty coming to terms with the fact that he killed a child to such an extent that he is contemplating suicide he might not have to do it however as ken gets a call from harry their employer telling him he is to kill ray of course nothing goes quite as expected ray falls in love with a local conwoman and ends up dealing with her less than competent exboyfriend who threatens him with a revolver a dwarf who has some strange views about race when on drugs and some large american tourists who dont like being told they are too big to go up a church towerthe martin mcdonagh wrote a great script the brilliantly directed a cast of talented actors brendan gleeson and colin farrell were great as ken and ray they are able supported by clmence posy as rays new girlfriend chloe thekla reuten as pregnant hotel owner marie and ralph fiennes as the two killers employer who had a strict rule about never hurting a childif you are offended by swearing give this film a wide birth as it contains almost nonstop bad language it also contains some bloody violence that might bother some viewers however if these things dont bother you then id strongly recommend this a laughed out loud many times and wont deny that i also shed a few tears,black_comedy
i went down and intermission two films that are really similar in humor dialog wittiness and simple entertainment to ive watched these three films repeatedly because they fit my bill of what i always come back to when watching a film my most important ingredients being dialog plot acting and entertainment im sure ill come back to these films again and again though is the most compelling and most polished of the three with the four main players in the film director and leading actors almost showing off theyre mastery of their art if not quiet reaching film perfection for me its film entertainment perfection ps where can i find divorcing jack i havent seen it since it was in cinemas,black_comedy
when i first saw the previews for i didnt really expect much but wow it really surprised me i wasnt only entertained but it actually was a really good film this is martin mcdonagh first feature film after winning an oscar for best live action short a few years backis labeled as a dark comedy type of film however it is more dark than comedic which is a good thing i expected something more of a regular comedy that tried to take itself top seriously by adding the crime aspects to it its actually more of a crimedrama type with a lot of added humorcomedic situations and it works quite wellits shot entirely belgium the backdrop scenes are beautiful it shows the classic older style of architecture of western europe amazing cinematography cool dark colors set up the tone and style of the filmyou know the plot two hit men reside after a botched job they wait for a call from their boss to hear what to do next seems simple right well it is thats what i like about it its simple but to the point the writing is what carries the film it makes everything interesting tremendous witty dialogue throughout the film which also receives recognition with an oscar nominationi was pleasantly surprised with colin farrell he really gives a great performance and fits extremely well in to role earns a lot more respect with this performance as a hit man he is surprisingly sympathetic brendon gleeson is also solid in his role he is a tough guy with a streak of humanity they seem to work together well ralph fienees also appears in a supporting role he shows his evil sides but is quite funny as well there is a variety of different quirky characters ranging from the two hitman an extremely overweight family a local love interest to a midget in a film production overrall solid performances all aroundi appreciated the dark comedy and with the moral complexity of the characters inner struggles theyre hit men but they are oddly interesting and seem much more like us than we may think it makes for a very satisfying film one that is much more than just entertainment its an interesting film that deserves to be looked into some time,black_comedy
a good drama about the human relationships dealing with love death and the purpose of life the ideas are taken from dostoevskys crime and punishment great scenery throughout the movie this movie is not though a comedy it is treated as a comedy and was even nominated as a comedy but its not a comedy or a dark comedy not through the wording nor through the actions the acting is good colin farrells performance is good but having few facial expressions mimicking johhny depp or heath ledger are not enough to grant a golden globe so the acting is overrated also in overall an overrated film on all aspects i have no clue why it is 81 but it is a good flick that you can enjoy if you know what you are going into it is not a dark comedy it is a pure drama with slight dark humor relief undertones the word comedy was probably entered for marketing campaign if you want good drama go for it a light comedy or any comedy skip this one because it is not,black_comedy
after the dismal flop of alexander collin farrell has fallen sharp on his acting and presence in good films is farrells film delivering high octane and sharp witted acting farrell continues to pursue greatness and will hopefully participate in other great films in the future although is certainly farrells film he couldnt have managed without the brilliance of his sidekick brendon gleeson and director martin mcdonagh despite some minor flaws is a great example of a black comedy sharp acting comedy as dark as the nights sky beautiful cinematography and an oscar winning director at the helmwhat more could you want,black_comedy
i had high hopes for this movie roeper and whoever made it sound as though it was one of the best movies of the year and hilariousit was pretty good but it was not great and i dont know exactly whyit had a few laughs but it was not a comedytwo hit men go to bruges pronounced brooj after a hit the person who hired them sends them there supposedly for a little r  r after a hit one of the hit men played by brendan gleeson soaks in the history the other played by collin farrell is bored to tears until he meets a local woman she has an exboyfriend she also deals drugs to a movie cast and crew who are filmingwe dont know why the hit men well actually the hit man  farrell was the hit man gleeson was the person who recruited him were hired to do the job or why the hit was commissioned but this was not important anyway ralph fiennes plays the guy who called for the hitoh  theres also the hostess of the hotel or was it a b  b where farrell and gleason are staying shes pregnantim not going to say too much more because to do so would give away too much of the plotthe acting was fine gleeson especially shines ralph fiennes is properly menacing farrell does a pretty good job as a novice hit man the women are fine although they really arent given much to do with their partsthe movie was entertaining and it held my interest and it was a nice change of pace from a hollywood story but i cant highly recommend the movieit was worth the price of a matine plus a medium popcorn and soda,black_comedy
i was looking forward to this being a huge fan of martin mcdonagh and colin farrell and brendan gleesonbruges is a character in the film too a beautiful bruges canals cathedrals and lovely cobblestones lit beautifully by eigil bryldbut all of this was not enough to sustain the beginning of a pretty good story line to the end it just got murkier and murkier along the way until i just didnt know what kind of movie it was trying to be drama comedy noir slash one of my hated clichs in any movie is the corpse that just wont die you know the type shot knifed thrown from high building bleeding copiously in all directions but the damn thing keeps spewing out advice or deathbeddy bon mots while climbing messily to great heights gushing and smearing blood everywhere without spoilers this film had a surfeit of such clichs i groaned again and again and againcolin and brendan playing hit men ken and ray shine in a slowly developing relationship that is foisted upon them by their boss there are some funny bits one gets invested in the characters a few twists and turns to the plot follow not all successfulralph fiennes for once is a little over the top as the head of the hit organization he was ralph visibly actingbrendan was brilliant and deserves an award for his performance what this man can do with a shrug or an eyebrow is magicalbut overall i was disappointed 6 out of 10,black_comedy
apparently has some sort of fan base going on with reviews on this site saying it might be the greatest movie of the decade all i can say is that standards for movies are at an all time low i will try my best to avoid giving spoilers for this movie basically about hit men in hiding contemplating about their chosen profession seems like it should have a darker tone for a movie unfortunately the result is a mix between some weird heavy drama and some terrible lines that arent funny we have the more sophisticated guy obviously paired with the younger retarded guy who botches his first job and feels the urge to yell whenever hes joking just in case you missed it because the jokes in this movie are pretty bad add in some obscene language and its all hilarious right the only way this movie is entertaining is if you dont care about the plot and like midget jokes but even then the movie keeps throwing on a more serious tone that contrasts pretty terribly with the whole premise of the film and the comedic sections basically is a failure because it doesnt stick to any particular style and in so doing messes both of them up,black_comedy
is one of those comedies that thinks it is far more witty and clever than it actually is its a shame because it has an interesting premise with a lot of potential but ultimately that potential amounts to nothing more than cussing and midget jokesthe film follows two hit men ray colin farrell and ken brendan gleeson who are ordered by their boss harry ralph fiennes to hide away in the remote belgian town of bruges after a botched hit in london they are supposed to stay until harry gives them a call saying its ok to leave ken seizes the opportunity to explore and sightsee while ray who takes an instant disliking to bruges prefers to spend his time at the pub while there the duo have many strange encounters including ones with a midget actor a skinhead robber dutch prostitutes and involving loads of drugs all which lead up to a matter of lifeordeath situation involving ray ken and harryis a strange combination of a drama and a comedy and it really fails in both genres the movie is primarily a comedic one although there are a few jokes that were mildly funny most of them fall flat the problem is that presents itself as sophisticated and tries to come off as clever characterbased comedy yet half the jokes are incredibly low brow for instance there are repetitive jokes involving a midget even if the joke had been remotely funny in the first place which it wasnt its repeated far too many times before the movie ends most of the jokes are meanspirited and unpolitically correct dont get me wrong i normally wouldnt have a problem with that however here there is nothing funny ray ridicules overweight people he karate chops the midget he knocks out a couple in a restaurant swears like a sailor and once again with the midget engages in a discussion about whether or not there will be a race war in the future none of this is funny its cruelspirited for the sake of it the director must know that simply being meanspirited isnt funny theres nothing clever or witty about it its the same humor weve seen done before in countless idiotic low brow comedies presented as a sundanceapproved highbrow comedyas well it wouldve helped if the lead role was played by someone other than colin farrell i like farrell hes a good actor he is not a comedic actor though hes just not funny its as simple as that his performance here is good but hes not funny enough for a movie like this his character gets most of the better lines in the film and they are all wasted ralph fiennes fairs much better comically yet is relegated to the last 30 minutes of the filmthe rest of the movie is a mess as it strives to be a thoughtprovoking drama as well as an action film towards the end there are long periods of the movie devoid of jokes which would be fine if anything were happening unfortunately for the first hour of the film nothing much happens ray and ken stumble around bruges doing random things its boring and dull there are a few emotional moments here and there and although they are well done they dont fit in with the rest of the movie which is often crude and crass the last 20 minutes has some good action violence and shootouts but which once again really has no place in this film the ending switches gears from this and attempts to be profound it feels out of place hot fuzz which came out almost a year ago and had a similar premise stuck primarily to the comedy genre and succeeded tries to blend together comedy and drama trying to be profound rude funny and thrilling its too much and the film wouldve worked better if it had focused more on one of these areasall in all i cant say i recommend its a jumbled mess of a film that thinks much too highly of itself the only thing worse than being stuck would be having to watch this film again,black_comedy
i watched this movie and love the first 23 but the end did not jive with the first 23 if anyone has seen the sopranos this movies end is stupid if you love classic 30s and 40s hollywood ending then you would love this movie when a fellow survives a bloody gun shot then throws himself off a freaking cathedral and lives long enough to give the man he was supposed to kill enough information to live after seeing the first 23 of the movie come on no i really do not care probably would have been a good movie spoiled by a bad ending you are better off watching the sopranos any episode then watching this movie,black_comedy
one of the worst movies ive ever sat through why did i do it because its a train wreck i kept hoping it would get better that their would be some type of action their isnt this movie just wanders around like jazztook me two days to complete this tour de bruges and i did not get a yellow jerseywarning the concentrated slowness contained in the film will cause you your mind to wander to anything and everything this resulted in me talking in a thick british accent for a full 2 weeks after watching it i just couldnt stop or shut it offas a side note i thick this film belongs in gitmo cuba,black_comedy
well this film had some great actors and a wonderful setting it also pointed towards some redemption but alas the directorproducerscript writer decided to appease the american type audience by 1 using some extremely graphic and violent shots of people being murdered again and again 2 attempting to make murder and murderous types humorous 3 and the list goes on its a bit of a combination of the third man with pulp fiction but without the cynicism of the former or the dance sequence of the latter in other words it had no redeeming qualities since theres only about three murders in europe in a year the chances of this happening are slim to ill i know it is cool to have hit men be intelligent and sympathetic but in real life such thugs are slimy psychopaths with the moral interests of a snail the film also threw in a midget and killed him off too just to make one last point which was that the whole film was a contrived piece of garbage it could have been good if they had eliminated bruges murder hit men etc but hen that would have forced the film makers to provide some depth realism and humanity they should all be lined up themselves in retaliation for brutalizing the audience with this,black_comedy
i was well into the end of the movie and i was still asking myself well when will something start happening i mean by that when will something happen in the movie that i can actually care about what i did find myself caring about was the tremendous amount of vulgar language in it in fact i actually kept a count in the hourand45min movie i counted 130 fbombs 16 sbombs and 23 various other vulgar or obscene terms that works out to 13 bombs per minute this is quality dialog this is quality writing i realize the subject matter isnt the most gentile of subjects but my point is that i cared more about the language than i cared about the movie that does not speak well of a movie if i had my druthers i wished i could have my hour and 45 mins back and spent it watching something more intelligent like wild hogs ps i hate wild hogs,black_comedy
this is mcdonaghs first feature and its a sure bet that hes a writerdirector to watch in the future was advertised as a straight comedy featuring gangsters who like to shoot at each other so the threedimensional characters and emotional depth come as a nice surprise colin farrell who if he hadnt already convinced me he was a great actor certainly wins that title now stars as a green hitman with a short attention span who messes up his first job by killing an innocent bystander things seem to be okay with the boss ralph fiennes who sends farrell and his partner brendan gleeson to the beautiful belgian town of bruges to wait for their next instructions the fact is fiennes plans for gleeson to snuff out farrell thats the basic setup and it would be criminal to reveal too much more mcdonaghs script is a thing of beauty quickwitted smart and frequently touching i did think that the final twists were a bit overly clever jordan prentice who plays the dwarf jimmy in the film began his career as one of several dwarfs inhabiting the howard the duck costume in the film of the same name,black_comedy
ah we finally reach spys favorite genre of film the hitman dramedy one of my favorite films is the matador which is about a dysfunctional hitmans friendship with a regular average joe while sporting similar characters is different in the plot and outcome but is the same in that it is now one of my favorite filmsit is a great character study martin mcdonaghs existential hitman piece has wonderful humor packed into a greater drama that serves as a big time eye opener for our characters all three of our leads colin farrell brendan gleeson and ralph fiennes will experience a change in their outlooks on life before the credits roll for those that do not know this film it follows the misadventures of two hit men farrell and gleeson belgium as they await a call from their boss fiennes its a moving picture despite the fact that it moves fast and has some of the best comedic dialog of the year i found the movie utterly hilarious at some points with most of the humor coming from colin farrellive always found that the existentialintrospective type of dramedy has been my favorite type of film and the fact that theres guns firing and laughs bursting at the same time only makes it better theres humor injected into all the action sequences though they are few and far between they are well shot and edited a good score also helps the film out a lot but this film truly belongs to our actorsi never thought id say this but damn colin farrell is wonderful in the film and in my opinion his role was the hardest to pull off ive noticed that farrells best performances come when he uses his natural irish accent the emotional intensity of farrells performance combined with his uncanny comic timing make for the best performance of his career bar none his character was my favorite in the story and he really impressed me here brendan gleesonwell ive long felt that hes one of europes diamonds in the rough and very underrated hopefully he gets the exposure he deserves from this film gleeson giving us a wonderfully introspective show helps provide the wisdom and balance to farrells fast talking youngster the partners really compliment each other then theres ralph fiennes who despite being absent for a big portion of the movie had me on the floor laughing when he finally enters he is heard on the phone at some point but doesnt actually appear for a while longer to continue the appearances of cast members from harry potter and the goblet of fire clemence poesy is also impressive and might i say quite beautiful and well casted in her role as chloeis a true gem of an actiondramedy that shouldnt be missed it has a wonderful script with the best dialog of the year some of which will have you laughing through the next few lines after its a beautiful character study and a well shot piece that will make our director a hot commodity over the next few years farrell gleeson and fiennes should be proud to have this movie on their resumes i know i would be,black_comedy
if there is a person that hates bruges the most it would be ray in the movie played brilliantly by colin farrell i cant say im a huge fan of farrell but i couldnt think of anyone else id rather see play ray in this movieif you like dark humor than this movie is way up your ally as you might of read in imdbs trivia section the word  is said 125 times in this movie and every time it makes me crack up interestingly ralph feinnes doesnt make his mark until the last half hour of the movie every scene he is in made me laugh so hard so many brilliantly played out awkward moments that always have a punch line even if it was meant to be serious the script was brilliant and very original the movie only made around 7000000 in the united states but then again most of the little films these days seem to be the better movieray and ken brendan gleeson are trying to settle down from there wild lives of being hitman but it isnt easy for hitman to blend in as tourist the big turn of the movie comes around forty minutes but it acts like a small twist so i wont say anything elsetheyre really isnt much out there on dvd right now so as long as violence profanity and drugs and there are lots of all the above dont offend you give a try could be the biggest surprise of the year,black_comedy
johanna adorjn is one of my favorite print journalists so sharp is her mind and so acute her judgment that her reviews are universal applicable even to movies she may not have seen at all anyway she said about some other movie that for reasons of clarity it should be entitled beware very very boring very true and very applicable to i was at least as bored by the story as colin farrells character is by medieval architecture in fact is so boring that you wonder whether it was funded by the flemish board of tourism the movie only picks up some speed when harry arrives on the scene cast against character ralph fiennes plays a fasttalking mobster with a heart of gunpowder and a quirky code of honor minor perks include local lassies like clmence posy in the part of chlo and thekla reuten as a hardheaded innkeeper the one thing that makes the movie stand out despite its many flaws is carter burwells music but it feels strangely out of place in a movie so devoid of depth and drama guest appearance by ciarn hinds as a moribund priest oh and for those of you who need to know johanna adorjn was talking about sex and the city i guess thats another one to stay away from,black_comedy
in pulp fiction the dialogue was if not witty exactly at least funny from time to time and you empathise to an extent with jules and whateverisnamewas especially after the scene where they are cleaning up the car thats really quite funnytheres nothing equivalent in and they cant even spell or call it right the city is really named brugge as everybody knows and i dont understand the point at all wtf is all that stuff with the midget all about and why is it to be assumed that just because a guy uses the cword every third time he opens his mouth that that makes him well hard sexy beast another totally crap film makes the same mistake the fairies at the bottom of my garden are harder than harry isas a gangster film its ludicrous has there been a decent gangster film since lee marvin died and as a comedy it fails the very first test it just aint funnymy rating 2 stars out of 10 and it only gets them on account of the lovely shots of the wonderful city of brugge that you get to see by accident every so often,black_comedy
i had been interested in seeing this film after having viewed the trailer and jumped at the chance to see it at a local arts theater sadly although it is not without charm i found it to be slow and dry more often than not it seemed as if the film was searching for an identity that it never really found was it a comedy drama gangster picture or what i was was never sure the scenery is interesting and of course plays a role in the film i did enjoy some of the comic dialogue and moments in the story but in the end it did not make it a worthwhile trip to the theater i would have been happier seeing it on cable and not spending 700 my suggestion wait until you can see it on cable and save your money,black_comedy
when i first saw i liked it very much in a short time a very good screenplay is brought to us in a beautiful film i think this movie had the best original screenplay in 2008 i like that movie because it has lots of good sights first of all screenplay is perfect actors are playing normally music is great i think classic music makes movies very pleasant to see and there are no extra scenes if there is a scene is has to be there i have seen lots of movies which are two and a half hour long and have nothing to tell the audience but a story which can be brought to them in hour and a halfthe movie isnt boring at all beautiful buildings and european architecture makes the movie very nice to see is a film not too long and not too short which gives you its story in amazing way youll also hear some very funny dialogs in the movie so it wont be boring 110 minutes of criminal story about guys with guns it has a great ending and its one of the best movies of modern times for mei have never heard about bruges before but after seeing the film i really have desire to visit it i recommend everyone not to miss it,black_comedy
two hit men are stuck belgium one loves the place and the other hates it they tour the beautiful medieval scenery meet a girl and a midget do drugs have some fights some funnystupid conversations and eventually there is a shootout if that sounds kind of boring than you have an accurate idea of what the movies like kind of boring with some redeeming qualities some interesting situations good acting some funny dialogue and nice cinematography the high point by far was the ralph fiennes character but he doesnt show up till the movies half over at some of the more preposterous action situations i had to keep reminding myself this was a comedy or was it i wasnt really sure which is probably why this film didnt work for me if i think about the setup and the ralph fiennes character this could have been a really good movie but there is just too much screen time in the first half where nothing particularly interesting or funny is going on,black_comedy
i liked this movie not enough to say its some kind of great film its basically a less glossy variation on the matador from a few years ago but its different and intelligent colin farrell plays a newbie hit man who messes up his first assignment and brendan gleeson is his friend who brought him into the organization and is tasked with bringing him out of it by the brutal kingpin played by ralph fiennesas i say some elements seem to remind me of other movies which is how i take this movie down perhaps a few points the buddy movie hitman thing was similar to matador and fiennes whole character role in the story and even his performance was a bit too similar to ben kingsley in sexy beast which is a much better movie however this movie of course was different because it was the novelty of the setting wears a bit thin and at that point so does the movie although not tediously so i think that some of the characters were too arbitrary to really hold any weight especially the drugdealing girlfriend character theyre really just fantasy fodder for the teenage audience that wants to feel sophisticated watching a european movieultimately its a good movie because gleeson and farrell are so good together that they create some moments that are different and interesting to watch but it all degenerates into silliness by the end,black_comedy
this is a rare gem of a movie which by all standard definitions should not work at all however it does and boy does it most movies which try to contain everything usually fall over with over elaborate or totally stupid subplots however this film does not fall into any of these traps it ranges from funny sad romantic sort off to down right nasty and pulls it off magnificently the plot is simplistic yet very clever and this is where its beauty lies the movie will definitely not be to everyones tastes and some of the jokes  scenarios that the colin and brendan get themselves into are so far off the dogooder brigades pc scale that they need to have a classification of there own but if like me you can look past this and enjoy them in the context that they are in then you will love this movie enjoy this little diamond,black_comedy
dir martin mcdonagh  profane twisted at points a beautiful travelogue at other times a boschian nightmare this film is the best written of the year and probably the most surprising these reviews tend to lend themselves toward absolute statement so ill just say it the funniest film of the year as with the other fine comedies of the year the humor comes from the characters and their situations mcdonaghs wit is unmatched and his past as a playwright allow him to craft such ugly racist and profane ideas into tightly coiled bundles of hilarious dialog it is completely unpc but endlessly watchable and quotable,black_comedy
balances black comedy on a razor wire its the kind of movie that makes you sit up and take notice colin farrell and brendan gleeson are hit men hiding out its in belgium while awaiting on further instruction gleeson the more experienced hit man wants to take in the sights farrell the novice hit man just wants to get drunk gleeson is at home while farrell is bored out of his wits luckily they stumble upon a movie set that is shooting and meet some eccentrics they meet the sets drug dealer and a dwarf jordan prentice whos wonderful being used for a fantasy sequence that distraction takes farrells mind of his torment you see he just completed his first job as a hit man and botched it he made the hit but a child got killed in the process this is just eating farrell up inside in the meantime the boss calls and gleeson gets the call he has to kill farrell the boss makes it clear that its unacceptable that a child got killed accidental or not in a very funny tense scene gleeson is sneaking up on farrell sitting on a park bench getting ready to kill him only as he gets closer find out farrell is about to kill himself so gleeson stops him from offing himself and sends him on a train so that he wouldnt be found gleeson calls the boss tells him that he wasnt going to do it and that he just sent him on a train to god knows where the boss played by ralph fiennes who does much with his little screen time decides to take things in his own hands and go to bruges himself all of this builds to a suspenseful and frantic conclusion  you just might find well worth a return visit,black_comedy
when i had my cinematic travel experience in it was a sheer entertainment extravaganza writerdirector martin mcdonaghs creation was a juicy bloodbroiled black comedic offering with a few irish fried hit men to go along with it colin farrell and brendan gleeson star as ray and ken the aforementioned hit men protagonists who are ordered by their mob boss harry to lay low belgium due to the fact that ray accidentally killed a young boy on a hit job ken takes a touristy liking to bruges while ken thinks that bruges is the boredom capital of the world their hit men chemistry was definitely on target and in equilibrant comparison to jules  vincent in the classic pulp fiction and this is a fact team kenray do come across some eccentric characters while including a a foulmouthed dwarf actor a oneeyed robber and a rude canadian couple a ray of sunshine appears in rays torturous bruges experience when he meets the beautiful ecstasy drug dealer chloe things get a bit hairy for ray  ken when harry comes to bruges to hunt them down for hit men insubordination if such thing exists colin farrell was phenomenal as ray with his witty banter on his hatred for bruges farrell also did the best heavy emotional work in his career portraying ray as a guiltridden suicidal hitman while still maintaining his sarcastic comedic liveliness gleesons subdued but resounding performance was also a sure shot winner ralph fiennes continues to be one of the finest actors in the business with his hairraising thespian fineness as the menacing harry i also gladly in took the supporting acting experience with crafty performances by jordan prentice as the american dwarf actor jimmy and clemency posey as the poised chloe obviously the city of bruges does play an integral part of the films symbolization i dunno where mcdonaghs imaginative genial inspiration came from for his masterpiece direction  script but i bet this is a mcdonagh that has more tasty offerings for us to cinematically chew on for some time to come must also fare well to carter burwells soothing score might just get the top score as the best movie score of the year in my book so colonize yourself to colins colossal acting and the rest of the outstanding movie attractions that has to offer  excellent,black_comedy
is a black comedy whose idea arose from a vacation writerdirector martin mcdonagh took to the pristine town of bruges belgium mcdonagh reflected in the dvd featurette that he was in awe of the towns medieval beauty but had the simultaneous feeling of being incredibly bored after two or three hours he took these two disparate feelings and split them up over two characters colin farrell and brendan gleason are a pair of hit men who are paid by their boss to go to bruges for an undisclosed assignment they are supposed to pose as two tourists and maintain a low profile while waiting for a phone call ken gleason takes an interest in the sights of the town and jollily obliges while ray farrell is very bored he is somewhat of a cultural boob with low intellectual curiosity but he gets more likable as the film progresses as we slowly see that he starts to develop a curiosity about living a better life he is also bored because he has just accidentally shot a boy and is coping with guilt over that ralph feinnes also enters in the story a little later as the enigmatic boss the film is also populated by the kinds of characters that come with smalltown comedies an obnoxious canadian tourist a pregnant innkeeper an alluring coke dealer who ray falls in love with and her unfortunate boyfriend and an opinionated midgetthe film reminds me of analyze this or anger mangement in that it features a star robert de niro or jack nicholson in the above examples making fun of their screen personas colin farrell is playing to type in an extreme sense reflecting his public image shallow and mostly interested in booze and women in real life colin farrell is an avid reader and student of history who would be the kind of guy whos interested in a place like bruges but i digress its an interesting mix of genres but as is the staple of this genre the black comedy there are usually meaningless deaths i wont spoil what happens but i grew close enough to these characters that i came to hope that we wouldnt be seeing anything bad happen to themthe film also has an interesting and curious romance between ray and the coke dealer she seems to give him a lot of chances but it turns out that she has a dark side to her as wellthe dialogue was really good and it was clearly an engaging film but a pet peeve of mine in the dialogue is that everyone talks the same and uses the fword in every sentence the screenwriter did such a great job of giving everyone distinct personalities so i wish they would give them distinct styles of speech,black_comedy
simply fantastic the visual art in the film makes it worth the rent amazing location shots that are set amongst beautiful and historic backdrops compliment martin mcdonaghs perfect direction the acting in the film ranges from average to great but colin farrell gives the performance of his careerwhich is obviously not a grueling task the script was very inclusive and gave viewers aspects of dark comedy as well as straight comedy all of this was mixed into a pot of social awareness love story and satire the beautifully brutal action sequences were perfectly distributed between the dry and scoreless dialogue i believe is one of the finest of 2008 i absolutely loved this film,black_comedy
is easily the funniest movie ive seen this year brendan gleeson shines in his role colin farrell is sweetly believable and ralph fiennes steals the show the supporting cast is also outstanding ably supporting the stars bruges is beautiful a fairy tale town id never even had heard of before this movie the script is a crackerthe dialogue sparkles and the banter between brendan gleeson and colin farrell is hilarious is one of those films that demands repeat viewings simply because youre laughing so hard that you might miss the next oneliner admittedly it may be offensive to those of a sensitive dispostition but if you watch it with an open mind youll be surprisingly entertained my favourite movie of 2008 so far,black_comedy
contract killers colin farrell and brendan gleeson the former a clumsy hatchling with easily ruffled feathers the latter a calm veteran whose patience only intensifies farrells aggravation are sent to the picturesque old belgian world of bruges by their edgy ferocious boss ralph fiennes and told to await further instructions while gleeson peacefully absorbs the sights and historic buildings streets and quays farrell is pessimistic and finicky irritated with the lack of local nightlife from the wild playwright of the feral hypersensitive lieutenant of inishmore this is a wonderfully enjoyable setup for an actioncomedy buddy crime film it prepares itself with comic dynamics and quaint atmosphere just as it markets itself in trailers but it lets us down with an erratic handling of its tone as a jarringly dark twist in backstory unravels itself it could have balanced its mood swings if it did not so convincingly set itself up as the duo comedy as which it was marketedthe pace accompanies the tone in the dunce corner the films running time being nothing more than filled by the subplot of farrell striking up a romance with a thieving drug dealer he meets while she is working as a pa on a movie set with a temperamental dwarf actorthere is nothing wrong with a film that gets darker and darker as it unfolds buts missteps lay in its disappointing effect as well as its odd feeling of severing us from it as despite its beautifully antiquated medieval scenery and occasional moment of fulfilling humor among a promising cast of great contemporary english actors its struggle with its own contrivance being transparent more than the storys capacity to absorbby either following through with the spirit of its exposition or helming better control over its landslides into melodrama it could have avoided being an incoherent disappointment which if i came across it one day with a lack of better choices i would still watch again i sense it as a film that has the potential to grow on you despite its nearly crippling flaws,black_comedy
how do you make the story of a hitman who accidentally blew a hole through a childs head funny and light it aint easy but in bruge does it on several levelsyou definitely have to have a main character who can pull off something both dramatic and comedic and that someone is colin farrell miami vice a killer who finds hes having trouble living with the accidental death of child who got in the way of a bulletthen you have to have a great costar and he turns out to be brendan gleeson kingdom of heaven gleeson has been a favorite star of mine since his american portrayal of sheriff keough in lake placid his combination of dramatic chops mixed with witty line delivery made him the perfect choice for this roleyouve also gotta have some sort of tryst going on and theres actually several of those the primary is that of ray collin farrell and chlo clmence posy their brutal honesty with each other makes for some interesting mental sparring between the two and has some of the lighter moments within this otherwise dark dramedy the other is that between ken gleeson and pregnant belgium hotel owner marie thekla reuten kens distant manner opens up to marie during certain film segments and maries stunning good looks and prideful appearance make her a person to be reckoned with another minitryst comes thanks to a film being produced where one of its stars named jimmy midget jordan prentice is out to have a good time with whatever women he can find or drugsnormally location wouldnt necessarily play that important of a role in a movie like this that is truly a character study of dark people who are also genuinely decent in many ways but bruges belgium is important after ray farrell accidentally kills the small boy he and ken gleeson are told to get out of town and head to bruges for ken its like a vacation the stunning buildings and peaceful waterways put ken in laidback mode but ray is tense on edge and sincerely depressed at his accidental shooting of the small boy the two clash as soon as they reach bruges and their differences are mirrored in the landscape around them swans steeples guns and prostitutestheres also a comparative study going on between a famous painting of hell belgium that ken and ray check out to that of the movie being filmed in town by jimmy prentice and that of the experience ken and ray find while visiting this quaint belgian community i wont say more for fear of giving away too muchthe final bonus for movie watchers is checking out ralph fiennes the constant gardner as the overlyscrupulous death dealer harry waters hes a family man with a mobboss mentality who must head to bruges himself in order to set things right and once hes there things really heat up bullets fly bodies fall from tall buildings with resounding splats and he finds himself the victim of his own moral code in the end nicely playeda warning should probably be given to those who are squeamish or dont care for the overuse of foul language both play out significantly in the film but they are also integral to the characters and the life theyve chosen but you cant say i didnt warn you the r rating is definitely deservedwhats more interesting to me now though is that i would love to see bruges in person the extra features on the dvd include a boat trip through the canals of bruges and point out incredible spots of interest an added bonus for sure i just hope i dont see any cloaked midgets or men with silencers running around,black_comedy
it doesnt happen too often that international productions are filmed in belgium thats why it was big news in belgium when martin mcdonagh came to bruges to shoot his film over here a film with a title like this couldnt be filmed anywhere but in belgium you can argue right but the film could as well have been called in prague in sevilla in florence or in talinn if you want only martin mcdonagh sincerely seemed to be mesmerized by the city which we like to call the venice of the north bruges is beautiful fairytalelike and on a certain level the city really looks like an openairmuseum though the mayor of bruges and his band try very hard to make bruges a modern contemporary city and succeed to have it be more so its human for foreigners in the first place to be mesmerized by bruges and indeed it is possible that martin mcdonagh loved the city that much that he really wanted his film to be made over there in that case bruges is very lucky but whether bruges did everything to get this production to their city or it was the director or the producer who decided to film it makes no difference the result is great its a story about two hit men arriving as a viewer the only information we get at first is that something went wrong with their last job so their boss gave them the order to travel to bruges and keep low for a while try to be unnoticed and enjoy the great views the oldest of the two seems to be the smarter one he enjoys to do some sightseeing and loves the old buildings the museums and the great paintings by flemish masters he is brilliantly played by brendan gleeson you believe he can be a tough guy who is capable of murdering someone but on the other hand hes very soft sweet and nice gentle and a joy to be around one likes to listen to him when he talks and you cant dream of a better companion to find hanging around in a bar bruges and to have a couple of beers with his partner is the wild one he is played by colin farrell the actor who seemed to have forgotten for a couple of years that he was an actor hollywood wanted him to be a star instead an image that didnt him he is an actor indeed and he proves it here a brilliant one hes a comedian even i didnt know he was capable of giving such a performance really astonishing the rest of the cast is also great but of course everything stands or falls with bruges and the performances of the two leading actors as a flemish belgian it is a pity we dont get to see one flemish actor in the film while bruges is in flanders and the only belgians in the film are played by dutch french and walloon actors who  mind you  are all great i couldnt think of a negative word on this film its the best comedy ive seen in a long time i laughed my head off not once but also the second time i went to see the film bruges is so lucky that this film is made over here although mcdonagh and his cast make fun of the city and of boring belgium all the time its the greatest publicity bruges and belgium could dream of the film shows how beautiful some corners of our country are and how great it is to live over here i was proud to be belgian before seeing this film i am even more so after seeing it and i will see it again and again its so funny when something you love is made fun of we know its good so everyone can laugh also great are the constant laughs at the expense of the fat american tourists easy laughs i know but funny nevertheless,black_comedy
even if the life of a hitman thing has been done many times before is a great movie and miles above most of the crap being put out in theaters todaythe story is about two hit men ray and ken who after a hit that went wrong are ordered to go to bruges its in belgium and wait for their orders there ken goes around sightseeing but ray hates the place and wants to get out of there as soon as possible ray is still haunted by what happened at the last hit i wont give away what happened because it might be a spoiler and is pretty depressed but it all changes after ken receives a phone call from his bossas i said before the life of a hitman genre has been done many times pulp fiction you kill me movies like that i somewhat enjoyed you kill me but is a definite step upray and ken are two interesting characters that are fleshed out well for the movie they really are two good characters that you end up caring about by the end of the filmthe dialog is great and the black humor is very funny at parts some viewers might not get the humor but they can just go back to watching recycled crap like first sunday and meet the spartans i thought it was really funnybut the tone isnt always humorous as soon the story turns even darker the plot is interesting and theres many unexpected twists along the way its a good balance between humor and drama and the movie plays both perfectlyits a shame movies like fools gold get nationwide release and lots of publicity but a gem like gets forgotten if you want a great comedydrama i definitely recommend but if you want a fullon actionpacked thriller this really isnt what youre wantinghas an engrossing plot great character development and is overall just a good movie its out on dvd now and i definitely recommend that you rent it or even buy it it truly is great and i say see it,black_comedy
martin mcdonagh makes an impressive writing and directing debut with the very fresh and entertaining and surprisingly well rounded film though the basic storyline is rather simple mcdonagh knows how to keep it turning and twisting with generous amounts of humor as well as probing character development he has assembled a cast of very fine actors turned the cinematography of the gorgeous belgian city of bruges over to the capable creative hands of eigil bryld and finished his project off with a fine musical score by the gifted carter burwell with a nod to schubert and others the result is a beautiful little film with messages galore and always a visual treat to see repeatedly two hit men  ken brendan gleeson a chubby optimistic bloke who loves spending time with the sights of bruges and ray colin farrell an emotionally distraught young man in the throes of guilt from a botched hit that accidentally killed a young boy  have been sent by their boss harry ralph fiennes to lay low after the botched murder of a priest ciarn hinds it is christmas season and there are too few rooms available so ken and ray reluctantly share a tiny hotel room to await further orders from harry ken falls in love with the beauty of the city of bruges while ray ever anxious and distrustful finds some solace in a film being shot about midgets jrmie renie with behind the scenes girl chlo clmence posy how these two irish guys make the most of their enforced isolation ultimately leads to the real reason for their assignment a reason that includes a last hit that sweeps the audience to a surprising ending mcdonagh writes very well giving some of the best comedic lines to farrell who proves himself a fine fit for this difficult role yes it is another hit man film but this one has the good fortune to deal with very real people conflicted with their choice of occupation and who are hungry to share their tenuous lives with good friends though there is considerable bloody derringdo the film uses the chase and kill scenes to good advantage allowing the audience to feel the human side of those whose job it is to off others both colin farrell and brendan gleeson are superb and their roles are enhanced by a choice selection of character actors who speed the plot along nicely this is a very entertaining movie one that can be appreciated on many levels and one that suggests that martin mcdonagh has a solid future in cinema grady harp,black_comedy
you cannot say much about this film without giving it away and i wouldnt dare do that as it is so full of surprises that everyone should see itit so reminded me of crete i spent two years there and visited all the minoan sites of course all the tourists go to knossos and my wife didnt mind that as it is partially reconstructed but the other four were a real pain to her one is way on top of a mountain that is accessible only by a one lane dirt road all the time you are going up you hope a bus isnt coming down you finally get there and you see the site as it is  a 5000yearold unreconstructed site in my wifes description we climbed up here to see a pile of rocks it is exactly how ray colin farrell felt when sent to bruges with his partner ken brendan gleeson ken like me of course liked the sites the banter between the two is priceless martin mcdonagh not only directed a winner he wrote some of the best dialog that i have heard in a long time imagine a hugh grant film with hit men well he did one of those didnt her but this was far superiorand it has fleur delacour clmence posy in a very unharry potterlike role she was really greatthere are so many great characters in this film and some great actors too like ralph fiennes the english patient schindlers list and two harry pottersthis is definitely a dont miss,black_comedy
wow what a little gem this movie turned out to be i had heard absolutely nothing about it and just decided to rent it a random to say the least i was pleasantly surprisedturned out to be a wonderful black comedy about two hit men spending time i the belgian town of bruges waiting for a call detailing their next assignmentthe script was very good but the dialogue is nothing but excellent there are so many wonderful moments and hilarious oneliners but it never feels forced or strained instead the comedy comes naturally from the situations and the charactersi dont think ive ever seen colin farrell in a comedic role before but he delivers a fantastic performance the same said can be said about the rest of the cast who were all wonderfulwas one of the best and funniest movies that ive seen this year and ive seen quite a bunch its quite rare with a movie that manages to balance drama and comedy so wellit is definitely a movie that i am likely to watch many times again in the future actually i had to pause the movie about half way through to send an email to my friends recommending this film dont miss it,black_comedy
id heard a couple of reviews comparing this to pulp fiction and so was eager to see it whilst i can see the comparisons they are very different the only similarities really is that there are 2 hitman the dialogue is razor sharp and slightly ambling and are both brilliant pieces of film in their own way is a lot more sedentary theres no hollywood gloss in this film and younger viewers may find it a little slow paced but the script is funny the cinematography is wonderful and all the characters are interesting i loved it when yuri who thought that nooks and crannies was a more suitable english word than alcoves the performances were all as what you can expect from such fine actors as ralph fiennes but i felt that colin farrell made the film with the main character ray surely this is an oscar winning performance and it heightens my belief that anything that film4 put their name to is a stamp of excellence with all that said ill reserve my only slight criticism of the film till last i like some other reviewers found that the end was slightly disappointing was it that or was because i simply didnt want the film to end,black_comedy
i tell you what  life is offensive funny eclectic existential and just plain pssed off when youre a hitmancolin farrell plays ray a very bored philistine hitman who hates his life his conscience and everything about bruges his mate ken an excellent brendan gleeson is more stoic dependable and has seen it allwhat lifts this is not only the script by playwright and first time director martin mcdonagh but the deadpan delivery and wonderful sense of comradeshipwithout a doubt one of the better films about hit men of recent memory  better than matador et al  due to a stonkingly good script and lots and lots of little touches and surprises it has real depth and polish but it is best when it just plain vitriolictop drawer comedy with some action thrown in probably not grannys cup of tea but definitely a good film if youre in the mood,black_comedy
saw it and totally loved itnever really thought much of colin farrell before but man he was great in this movie this suited him very well mr gleason was as always excellent and me and my gf got to sympathize with both these characters as this is an european movie we knew something would happen and it wouldnt have a happy ending where you get saluted in the end but this makes the movie all the more realit has brilliant humor and i hope the americans can take it seen a few on here who cant tho as its not how europeans see them its just the huge generalization that goes on about americans as there are generalizations about ppl from any country its not much to cry about i feel every time i see something being said about sweden or swedish ppl in movies good or bad i just think its rather funny the profanity and blood yes its some of that but if you cant take that you should stick to watching lindsay lohan or matthew mccouaughey moviesmany has made tarrantino parallels to this movie and to be honest it didnt strike me at all when i watched the moviesure tarrantino has made good dialouges in certain movies but these days he seems to squeeze in so much talking that its just chit chat you can easily go to the bathroom when nature calls or get snacks during his dialouges without missing anything and in this movie you simply cantloved this one from the start to the end at times it was super funny espc that time in the park when gleason was gonna finish of farrell at the same time it was intriguing and full of excitementi truly hope this movie gets its recognition cause it deserves that and in all seriousness this is a film one shouldnt take so seriously on the jokes that might offend but laugh at it instead for me tho the most fun parts were the really silly ones not the ones that might been offending,black_comedy
i went to see last night and i was really pleasantly surprised i didnt have high expectations since i hadnt heard much about it and im not a huge fan of colin farrell but im pleased to say that i was blown away by this dark witty black comedyi was laughing within 5 minutes of the film starting and the laughs continued from there somehow farrell manages to make his assassin ray both likable and amusing and the bond between the two hit men is touching without being sickly sweetbasically this film has it all comedy drama action thrills and a hint of romancei would highly recommend seeing it you wont regret it although i would warn people of a sensitive nature that its possibly the most politically incorrect film ive ever seen alongside death at a funeral which happens to be one of the worst films ive ever seen so watch out for bad language xenophobia drugs violence racism and yes even scenes of an antidwarf nature enjoy,black_comedy
masquerading as an action black comedy the film sets out to establish the town of bruges as purgatory the main protagonists wait for judgement for their past sins in the town one character overtly expresses his desire for repentance the others sins are more deeply hidden the point is emphasised by overtly referencing boschs last judgementthe consistently witty dialogue is gallows humour and the pair are each made to suffer graphically for their sins the younger character is left with the possibility of redemption the elder perhaps resigned to a transfer to hell although his descent is through a frosty air earlier equated to a fairy talethe resolution is perhaps a too trite symmetry with boschs painting brought to life as a film setother than this over emphasis perhaps necessary for a mainstream audience this is a well scripted tightly directed film with marvellous performancesi hadnt laughed out loud watching a film for a long time,black_comedy
i saw this movie yesterday after reading the reviews here i thought that i am going to see a crime comedy similar to that of guy ritchies lock stock and two smoking barrels its not its a drama with comic reliefs and i am not sure whether overusing fuking and bruges is a sht hole is that funny or just suppose to ease the tension that the movie would have imposed on the audience otherwise with that said i really enjoyed the movie it got a tarantino like dialog though its not a rip off it has a beautiful setting of bruges and i enjoyed hieronymus bosch references colin farrells performance is amazing and plot is interesting there are few movies which i will think about months after watching them and i think this will be one of these movies,black_comedy
two hit men hide out in an unassuming belgian town in this thriller which starts out as a quiet twocharacter study and then jukes and jives its way to a screamingly violent conclusion is a lowrent pulp fiction knockoff but its a knockoff that pays off in spades with strong believable acting excellent cinematography and a taut amusing scriptray colin farrell and ken brendan gleeson have just completed a rather difficult job and have been ordered by their boss harry ralph fiennes to repair to the idyllic town of bruges to lay low for up to two weeks two weeks with you ray exclaims to ken no way rays a novice to the world of hitmanning and being as young as he is hes not too keen to spend two weeks in any spot thats not teeming with hot women or other fun things to do bruges isnt exactly a mecca of excitement you see on the other hand the more seasoned ken is pretty happy with staying in the placid little burg because itll give him time to sightsee and take it easyboth men start to believe theres something else afoot why bruges after all theyre londoners so why not hide out in london or even in the english countryside no they had to schlep over to belgium there are plenty of belgian jokes and a smart dig at americans that was both accurate and snickerworthy but before ray can get properly bored he meets a sweet young lady named chloe clemence poesy late of harry potter and the goblet of fire working on a movie thats being filmed right there and he sees a chance to redeem himself for past sins  but apparently chloe has a few dark secrets of her owngleeson and farrell are wonderful together and the film avoids such clichs as the young impetuous hothead and the veteran killer on one last job and you never get the impression that theyre just a couple of lunkheads who go around killing people randomly you know the type guy gets tired awaiting further instructions so he shoots someone to keep in practice and of course nothing goes as ray and ken expect it to go theres no way of course that theyre going to stay the entire two weeks in the podunk town with nothing happening right yeah probably notso they wait around for harry to call and give them further instructions and when he does all hell really breaks loose but setting that aside for the moment here are some other entertaining aspects of the movie drug use gunplay midgets and blood yes midgets okay dwarfs and although theres no dwarf tossing there is a karate chop to a dwarfs neck which is awesome in and of itselfanother plus is the film is remarkably well shot filming on location in the actual town of brugge in belgium cinematographer eigil bryld brilliantly juxtaposes the angularity of the buildings and the beauty of the landscapes with the brutality of the mens violent behavior and coarse language the pooling of blood on stark gritty pavement surrounded by gleaming snowdrifts and the pulchritude and quiet desperation of bruges itselfalthough not as wittily intelligent as pulp fiction is still quite clever  and not too clever for its own good either its not one of those movies that tosses in funny dialog just to be funny or socalled twists just to keep the viewer guessing two charming gutsy performances by gleeson as the unorthodox older man and farrell as the twitchy younger one boost this one up a notch about the typical caper thriller,black_comedy
in bruge is an incredible film about two assassins struck in the mideival belgian city of bruges the movie is by martin mcdonagh his first although he has won the tony for playwriting and is an incredible story teller he has been described as tarantinoesquire and the dialogue certainly comes off that way as well as the comic presentation of violencei thought the drama was very well placed though many will disagree and it eventually added to the strong character development and overall effect of the story dwarfs are very prevalent in this film and provide much of the comic relief as well as the foreshadowed endingthe movie is funny violent rude with tons of swearing and an incredible story i recommend it highly,black_comedy
this movie could have easily have been the mobhitmanbuddy movie clich but it wasnt this movie is a better movie technically than i expected collin farrells character is reason enough to see it although the ensemble of actorscharacters overall are excellent and worth the price of admission as well farrells character may be viewed as unpc but i think it is important to his character he comes across ignorant that ignorance it is also part of the charm of the characterthis was one of those movies that i cant help but suggest to others because it was such a good time the movie also showed a great view of the city of bruges which needs to be on my plans when i get to europe next,black_comedy
is writerdirector martin mcdonaghs second film the first being 2004s six shooter i never saw the latter but i saw the former last night and it is a very good very entertaining movie mcdonagh still has something to learn about writing but hes nearly there and i think i should have to keep an eye on imdb for further works by this guyis a great collection of wellcrafted sequences first is the opening exposition on bruges itself a doddering old medieval town which irish felon ray well played by colin farrell despises outright his entire commentary on frumpy tourist towns early in the film is hysterical and quite accurate ive been to a lot of frumpy tourist towns and thought most of what ray says more than oncethe film continues on with other hysterical scenes like rays encounter with obese americans this film is quite hard on america actually but i didnt mind one bit theres also a botched robbery where typical touristtown criminals try to roll ray for cash and get far more than they bargained forthe film then moves on to introspective moments here is where farrells costar brendan gleeson comes to the fore he plays a quiet career criminal with a conscience concerned for the future of rays very soul i cant go into detail without announcing spoilers but these scenes are good toothen theres a great closing sequence where the astoundingly profane crime boss fantastically played by ralph fiennes catches up to the two hit men for a big showdown in the doddery villagethere are so many great moments and characters in this film i couldnt really type them all up but heres a quick list a oneeyed thief a racist dwarf a goofy european movie set a tourist trap tickettaker who takes his job waaay too seriously a beautiful local drug dealer horse tranquilizers a vulgar phone message and a pair of smokephobic canadiansmy one and only problem with this film is the overall writing as i said there are a lot of great sequences in this film and a lot of great dialogue however theres something not quite right with the structure of the piece it has been said that the two toughest parts about writing a story are the beginning and the end mcdonagh seems to have trouble with beginnings this film is quite fragmented up front and takes a while to build up steam i found this quite distracting he also doesnt really segue well sometimes youre wondering why did we move to this scene although once you do get there you love what youre seeingi think mcdonagh is well on his way though for these flaws are something that can be overcome given adequate effort and experience overall i liked and recommend it for those who like goofy criminal capers with a heart,black_comedy
i loved this movie i saw it at sundance probably best classified as a dark comedy has a mix of comedy drama and action there are a few violent scenes great job by writerdirector martin mcdonaghthe movie made me laugh from the opening note colin farrells voice over during the opening credits asking where the fook is bruges the movie follows two hit men stuck awaiting the next order from their boss farrell is dealing with some of his own personal demons much of the first half of the movie is talking heads but due to the clever writing and comedic moments often cynical and notpc the movie never gets stale both lead actors  colin farrell and brendan gleeson  are the superb and they make the perfect odd couple it is nice to see colin farrell playing a role other than the cool slick guy farrells character verges on whiney but that is part of what makes him endearing ralph fiennes add a bad guy to the mix of eclectic characters,black_comedy
two hit men wile away their days waiting fori forget bored after the initial sightseeing device wears thin the duo together and separately take some wild rides with a carnival of farfetched quirkladen characters a supermodel apparitioncumreality slut a cokedup racist dwarf a housemothermary in her third trimester bipolar drugdealers etc its as though the writer of this mess believes that comedy requires caricature great dialog can only be comprised of fourletter words and modern storytelling means stringing together 100 minutes of funhouse non sequiturs in order to keep an audience on its toes colin farrel puts in his worst performance to date indicating forcing and making faces to get his motivations across obviously the director is influenced by the tarantino school of filmmaking but sadly he missed the class on thematic points and the protagonists journey focusing on the flashy outrageous and cartoonlike aspects of recess the writerdirector claims he got the idea when he himself visited bruges he found the city so gothic and beautiful but then how bored he was after only two days and how he started to want to find a girl and get drunk etc isnt that inspiring to think that someones boredom can become the main plot line of a movie the oft repeated central question of the movie seems to be why are we why indeed very thoughtprovoking,black_comedy
omg i am dumbfounded by all the glowing reviews i think that i have to fault the script the most trite formulaic every ironic interaction was telegraphed to the viewer minutes ahead of time when colin farrells tough guy character is in the restaurant and has an interaction with an obnoxious weenie american ive seen this exact scene so many times before it was an agonizing 5 minutes as you sat through the predictable screen writing 101 set up moves culminating in the oh so ironic punch line painful colin farrells acting was way too forced and overthetop for me he seemed like he had to try way to hard i found it distracting admittedly the script and the directing are largely responsible here maybe ive seen too many movies but this was just plain bad,black_comedy
if youre trying to decide whether to watch this title or not and are using reviews to help you make a decision all i can tell you is look no further i also was very skeptic about this film the plot seemed ok acting crew looked great but something just didnt add up but that was all before i actually got the urge to watch this dare i say it masterpiece this film has that one key element that i seek for in films it can hold you glued to your seat and keep your eyes pinned on the screen the entire time this is the kind of film whose scenes have a way of sticking with you and in a way you keep remembering parts of the movie on daily bases i was very very surprised in a good way of course by this movie its incredible to see how much can be done without skyhigh budget explosions and hollywoody environment the plot of the film is as much interesting as one could get and the oscar nomination really speaks for itself all in all do yourself a favor and see this great film you wont regret a single minute of it and to add up this is my first review for imdb,black_comedy
centered in the small and unappealing town of bruges in belgium this very british based production achieves hollywood perfection redefining the ability to cross cut two differing genres is a comical yet tense work that stands superior to any past production piece regardless of its genre in which a deep feeling of envy should be feltemploying a narrative that does not stretch any further than being simple yet engaging it is a story that features both deep sorrow and realistic humour as two hit men ray and ken exile to bruges after a hit goes terribly wrong it focuses on the morals and trauma surrounding the pairs past killings as they engage with the historical beauty of bruges and the alternate lifestyle it offers the director martin mcdonagh is vigilante not to glorify the pairs criminal career in any way which is essential to the realistic factor the film employs as there is a deep focus on the aftermath and trauma of both their failures and lack of mercy for their victims the plot from early on is fairly engaging but it is the truly unsuspecting plot twist that engages the viewer further into the the tension that begins to climatically build from that point regardless of the change of attitudes and tipping balance of genre focus that switches between comedy to drama at various points the comical and emotion provoking actions that the characters commit provide a narrative that is not only unique but surprisingly enjoyablewith a strong focus on a shrewd use of comedy throughout provides the viewers with an extensive collection of memorable scenes due to the many comical moments and factors that account for the films comedy based success being dominated by a fairly broad range of foul mouthed arguments often ending in violence the more significant comedy factor is present within the difference in ideology and interests between ray and ken with the pairs similarities stretching no further than their corrupt career path the pair often resemble the powerless father and brat like child relationship in the early aspects of the plot yet it is the lack of belonging the pair experience in the somewhat unideal town of bruges that provide the most credible element of amusement throughout as two irish hit men in a small belgium town is unsurprisingly unideal as their actions from early on indicateincorporating a fairly small yet diverse range of characters the casting follows other aspects of the films success in being impeccable with colin farrell heading the cast as the guilt stricken hitman ray his performance of a far from stable individual with a lack of enthusiasm for his partners historical interests or bruges itself is of the highest caliber farrells revival of his often disregarded irish accent is highly approved of as it certainly emphasizes the comedy within his dialogue and is obviously an essential factor for the characters portrayal brendan gleeson shares not only the strong irish accent employed by farrell but equals the high standard of his performance gleesons portrayal of the culture loving hitman ken tends to be so genuine that his characters career choice tends to seem hard to believe which is far from a criticism considering his characters purpose is to blend in with the law abiding citizens of bruges ralph fiennes on the other hand is a far more clouded character for the most part as ken and rays boss harry displaying the ruthlessness not present within the exiled pair of hit men fiennes performances as yet another villain is just as flawless in comparison to his contributions in past productions and his casting colleagues in this onewhere as the visual factors of are immaculate its relevant soundtrack deserves the same credit with a primarily piano based soundtrack it is not only suitable for the location of the film but also adds to the sense of foreboding which ensures the comical factor disappears in the more serious sequences of the films narrative without this imperial soundtrack the impressive balance between drama and comedy would certainly be lostundoubtedly is one of the most unsuspecting film successes of the 21st century with a narrative that is easy to follow and thus more engaging a likable cast of characters and flawless performances by the cast themselves genuinely is a must see film and shouldnt be overshadowed by its lack of popularity on the big screen,black_comedy
ive always preferred watching old films  even when they werent so old i preferred films made in the golden age to all those modern films made in the 60s but i still occasionally try new ones out usually to my disappointment or disgust but is one of the great exceptions ive now seen this a couple of times how such seedy violent profanities can appeal to me still puzzles me but theres no doubt to me that this is a brilliant film  with many faults dazzling to watch my daughter wasnt as impressed as me so maybe it helped not to be as used to modern movies or maybe its just that youll either love it or hate ittwo irish hit men colin farrell and brendan gleeson hole up  definitely not an excrementhole  they dont know why except to await orders from their gangster boss ralph fiennes back in london farrell is mentally tortured by the recollection of accidentally shooting a young boy in the head when the order finally comes to gleeson it comes as a surprise to put it mildly with everyone constantly swearing their heads off with some great lines all bickering taking the mickey the story veering into very dodgy territory at times all depicted with a slapstick frankness great photographycoloursense of humourstyle editing and atmospheric music so what if the denouement was a little contrived and telegraphed to the viewer well in advance it all made perfect sense in a glorious black comedy favourite bits from so many the opening sentences after i killed him  farrell and the bunch of elephants interested in the church the dismissive references to gay beers the wingeing skinhead shot in the eye by a blank fiennes sorry for calling his wife an inanimate object the wonderful meeting between gleeson and fiennes in the caf with so many sidesplitting unrepeatable comments made or retracted i really really hoped farrell wouldnt die too i never thought i could laugh so much at so much coarsenessits fast and stylish with beautiful bruges at all times looking like its from a effing fairy tale not recommended if offended by sexviolencebad languageadult themes as i very often am but only in what it shows the filmmakers think of their audiences  however this is an eye popping work of art in my admittedly limited experience utterly unique and recommended,black_comedy
is an impressive feature length debut by playwright martin mcdonagh its spoton pace sparkles with intelligent dialogue and black humour within minutes i felt i knew the principal characters irish hit men ken and ray brendan gleeson and colin farrell for years and felt drawn in like an invisible third protagonist to join them on their leffefuelled strolls along the gothic canalsthe titular city functions more than a mere cinematographic backdrop it evolves with the plot becoming more otherworldly and menacing as the pitch of impending doom heightens reaching its crescendo in the final scene as ray stumbles into the living canvas of boschs last judgementit appears obligatory for smart movies these days to reference cult cinema and does contain several such nods including a recurring homage to nic roegs dont look now itself referenced in the dialogue this is does not unduly distract merely reinforces mcdonaghs anchorage in the fabric of unnerving european cinemamany will principally remember this movie for its laughoutloud surrealism such as the ketaminestoned racist dwarf yet beneath the buoyant dialogue and memorable set pieces lies a convincing morality tale the choices and questions effortlessly posed here are no less serious than those in more selfconscious and ponderous recent redemption tales i actually found myself pausing the movie at one point to ask myself what i would do in a situationwith tarrantino firing blanks these days i for one would be delighted to see mcdonagh establish himself as the modern champion of smart edgy cinema,black_comedy

dark and moody with a bitter sense of irony this film tastes like an old red wine thats about to turn its still enjoyable even though its slightly more bitter than it has to becolin farrel has really come about i couldnt stomach him for a while after his alexander performance val kilmer is guilty too pretty sure nobody in ancient greece had an irishbritish accentanyways really liked colin in this movie he did an outstanding job the whole cast was absurdly funny throughout the tower scene still makes me laugh when i think about it oh and if you like watch calvary its brilliant just like this film,black_comedy

hello mr mcdonagh hello martyi think you made a few nice movies and just saw three billboards thank you for your cinematic evolvement or how should i call it every movie is getting betteri played in your first movie but got cut out i think you missed your first oscar there but sure your chimney will be filled with those shiny little men with or without my helpthere was one scene cut out of where i was holding 2 dwarfs under shot while batteling each otheri think that if i was born for acting that is precisely what i dreamt of twin peaks but weirderlet me recall upon my humble role in the end there was a scene on the plaza with a kind of weird characters from a jeroen bosch scene who is from holland but thats is only a detailthis was way beyond the game of thrones era when small people became popular even as my role was called apron man it had nothing to do with the marvel legacy spiderman and other cweirdos fasten your seatbelts and eat my shorts you never know when i ll do my come backanyways i understand why you have cut the scene out it would have been taken the rhythm out of the plot nothing to do with my acting of course and certainly not of the counter actors of whom chris received an important role in a famous dutch series the othet guy has a nice job at a tele operator and i dated his niece who needs fiction anywaysjust to recall tou my availabilities is nice but you are doing better every time so let s agree that i can do a kind of birdman kind of movie with heath ledger in mindyours trulyapron man,black_comedy

gotta love that ray fines pronounced ralph fiennes yeah i know get a name but hes good in everything and hes great in this gem too many good things about this movie im a movie fanatic and is in my top ten its that goodthe shakespearean twist at the kids playground where brendan gleesons character changes from killer to life saver is genius but this whole film is a work of geniusand ray fines is fine,black_comedy
when a routine assignment goes awry two hired killerssurly amateurish farrell and serene experienced gleesonare exiled by their slightly unhinged but principled boss to bruges a quaint tourist town in belgium while awaiting further instruction and contemplating their situation one of them tries to take in the sights while the other shows nothing but disdain for it a unique and riveting blend of dark comedy and character study with intriguing welldefined characters edgy but amusing subject matter and a variety of profound themes including purgatory redemption and honor among lowlifes made all the more worthwhile by colorful acting and a vivid setting ,black_comedy
original and entertaining thriller that takes place in the picturesque bruges belgium has a reputation for being the most boring country on the planet and this movie fully explores that theory though apparently through proceedings its not great cast funny thought provoking and moving certainly derserves all the plaudits from many film lovers and has become somewhat of a cult movie,black_comedy
though its a little rough around the edges thanks mainly to some brash backwardsthinking edgy dialogue a mcdonagh trademark 2008 plays fast and loose with convention to usually crowdpleasing effect making for an unpredictable and pacy piece that doesnt stick to the confines of its genre its a generally entertaining twistandturnladen time that has some tangible consequences and proper payoffs for pretty much everything it sets up including a complete central character arc ultimately though this tight thriller is let down by the occasionally forced sometimes purposefully inappropriate humour and its overall detrimental edginess 710,black_comedy
im not at all a fan of colin ferrell this is probably my favourite movie of his that he is in and i still think hes pretty good but not great the script is different and pretty funny its actually quite interesting what really brings this movie up though is the stellar performance of brendan gleeson who is just awesome in this ive seen it more than once and it still holds my interest mostly because of him,black_comedy
can we all as a whole come to a consensus that martin mcdonagh is a screenwriting genius i confess is actually my least favorite of mcdonaghs filmography so farmy favorite being notsopopularly seven psychopathsbut thats not to say that this diabolical thriller didnt showcase his distinct talent beyond words is an offensive recklessly nonstop hilarious dark comedywith a heart i like it verdict a,black_comedy
is a charming yet dark film it rides the line of comedy and drama it is a film that is sure to keep you on your toes the storytelling is of a rare breed in modern cinema and because of this it is easy to appreciateanalysis of notable work writingdirecting the absurdity of the story of ray and ken is what makes it so charming two dangerous men spend some time together in a quaint town called bruges after a job goes wrong it all seems a bit peculiar but oddly it feels real it is humorous and unprofessional but seems as if these characters are real we are drawn in an easily invested into their situation martin mcdonagh keeps the tone under wraps all throughout the film when something gets to be too ridiculous he tones it down and brings some seriousness to the scene when things get too serious for their own good he brings in some more ridiculous humor he is in total command of the tone of the film and he nails it all the way through cinematographyediting the look of the film is one of bleakness and beauty mirroring the views of ray and ken eigil bryld ties these two worldviews together visually in such a beautiful manner the sequencing of the film is high energy there is never a dull moment or lapse in storytelling each scene pushes into the next and is filled with wonderful moments dialogueacting here is yet another fantastic part of the film there are lovely quips all throughout the film but they do not feel forced or out of place they add to the absurdity of the film but also its charm colin farrell and brendan gleeson are a wonderful on screen pair they had remarkable chemistry and they very much brought the film to life ralph fiennes plays a dangerous and inconsistent crime boss he shifts from stupidity to sternness in a split second and it is incredible musicsound perhaps one of the low points of the film the music doesnt always seem to fit the mood of what is being portrayed on screen although this could just be another aspect of the chaotic story we are presented with the sound design is full of beauty and ugliness there are a few scenes that turn out poorly for our heroes and the sound design adds to the level of pain we feel production designspecial effects the sets and locations of bruges are a marvel to behold they are full of wonder while still being rather bland the special effects are adequate for the film they draw no attention to themselves positive or negative save one rather gruesome sceneconclusion is a film of great wonder and excitement but also bleakness there is much to ponder about after viewing it it is a crazy ride all the way through and is one that is sure to be enjoyed by audiences with a quirky taste,black_comedy
this movie raises existential questions about life and meaning when two hit men are ordered to spend time in bruge a picturesque flemish part of belgium along the way to facing questions such as why pregnant mothers and children deserve special protection that lifestained adults do not youll wade through drunken druginduced attempts to dampen the meaninglessness of life together with attempts to connect in romance and pleasure and even some admirable bravery i thought the story was just too indulgent in terms of violence that its legitimacy and storyline was somewhat undermined still it does deliver a wake up call to those who are tempted to float dreamlike through life without grounding themselves in first things that genuinely are seeds of true meaningful fulfilling life,black_comedy
i knew nothing about except that it takes place belgium and yet i was completely surprised by it 10 minutes in and i was beginning to get the sense that i was not going to like this film much it took a while longer but slowly i was drawn into the story and started to care a little bit about the characters a few more story twists later and i was engaged and before i knew it the film had finished there are quite a few problems with but despite all of them i actually i did enjoy it its humor is often times dark which a lot of folks dont getlike in general some of the scenes are contrived and theres quite a bit of killing for a film that is in large part a comedy so if youre the type of person open to all of those elements in the same film see it if youre not one of those folks then stay away,black_comedy
absolutely wonderful film in every sense of the word nothing was missed here the dialogue the actors the characters and the plot are perfect with a wonderful setting and soundtrack to back it up what appears to be a standard dialogue focused crime movie turns out to be much more than that and the end product results in what is in my opinion one of the best films ever made,black_comedy
i watched this movie after seeing a youtube video about movies with hidden meanings it mentioned that was a metaphor for purgatory or hell and i was intrigued i wasnt disappointed this was one of the best dark comedies ive ever seen funny witty intensely dark and harrowing and i never knew what to expect my favorite character in the movie was ken played well by brendan gleeson the older hitman who we find out halfway through is a widower still wearing his ring and still mourning his late wife the major theme in the movie is the gray areas of morality and how there can be honor among thieves or in this case hitmen,black_comedy
a great day this has turned out to be im suicidal me mate tries to kill me me gun gets nicked and were still in fing brugescolin farrell plays ray a young irish hit man who botched his first job and ended up shooting an innocent young boy he and his partner the older more seasoned ken brendan gleeson are packed out of london by their overbearing crime boss harry ralph fiennes almost unrecognizable with cockney accent and perpetual sneer to the quiet belgian tourist town of bruges they are to stay until they receive further orders from harry they are urged to enjoy their time in the city which harry remembers from his childhood as being like a fing fairy tale or somethingthis hilarious moody very violent film by writerdirector martin mcdonagh is incredibly difficult to characterize is it a comedy an actionheist flick a downer drama hard to say whatever it is it blends elements of all these genres brilliantly features excellent comic performances by the three leads and even while youre cracking up you may find yourself pondering larger questions of death morality and purposewhy we are where we are both physically and spirituallythis is a unique and uniquely enjoyable film that with humor examines the conscience and the part it plays in our lives our deaths and perhaps most poignantly whatever comes in between a word of warning you must have a fairly high toleration for disturbing violence and extremely thick irish accents,black_comedy
masterpiece this is very simply an amazing film i sat down to watch it for a creative writing class and found myself amazed by the incredible writing at work herethe plot is complex and can be very emotionally draining but it only serves to turn this film into an artistic beauty colin farrell is perfect in this film he plays a character somewhere in between desperate and lost and yet still finds a way to make you laugh his best performance by far brendon gleeson and ralph fiennes deserves a lot of credit as well as their performances absolutely blew me awaythis is one of those films where everything is said and done and thought for a reason nothing and i mean nothing is done without purpose in this absolute sculpture of a filmps i wouldnt suggest it for date night l,black_comedy
not your typical assassination flick as the film combines elements of ruthless violence and squeamish humor side by side the character of jimmy the dwarf jordan prentice was a nice touch to provide all that conversation about midgets committing suicide a topic apparently that hitman ray colin farrell couldnt get enough of for a couple of assassins ken brendan gleeson and ray displayed a lot of honor and integrity in the way they conducted themselves they must have taken their cue from boss man harry waters ralph fiennes who honorably killed himself at the end of the picture when he wound up shooting jimmy by accident i would have expected nothing less although to be accurate jimmy wasnt a kid so harry would have had some leeway there id have to assume ray made it back to london at some point seeing as how his narration closed out the picture but the ending could just as easily be left up to the imagination of the viewer im pretty sure he made it myself though with a return trip to bruges in his future for some more culture and fun,black_comedy
is the story of two british hitmen lying low belgium after an assassination goes wrong this movie is a perfect balance of comedy and depression martin mcdonough seamlessly transitions from heavy subjects like child murder and suicide to goofs and gags and fat americans several scenes are simultaneously heartbreaking and hilarious there is also a masterful handling of reincorporation that is quite reminiscent of hot fuzz there were several scenes in this movie that seemed to just be oneoff jokes but eventually affected the plot and characters in profound ways later on the characters were all very distinct and fleshed out and its been a long time since i genuinely cared about fictional people so much the plot is absolutely one hundred percent pitch perfect it is meticulously balanced on the scale of unpredictability and poetic beauty on the far left of this scale lies something like game of thrones where main characters are killed left and right with no satisfying conclusion to their arch on the far right is star wars where the story is neat and satisfying but anyone who has seen a movie in their life knows exactly what will happen ten minutes in is somehow far left and far right at the same time the plot twists and turns in unexpected ways and it doesnt stop until the very end yet in the midst of this untidy anarchistic plot a clear lesson and meaning still arises,black_comedy
quite simply is a consistently hilarious dark comedy accompanied by a wonderful performance from farrell and satisfactory performances from the supporting cast additionally the film transitions competently between comedic and serious moments and has a number of appreciated though not entirely unanticipated plot twists is undoubtedly funnier than any of mcdonaghs more recent work but lacks the standout moments of psychopaths,black_comedy
this movie achieves so much but remains so focused so easy to understand and streamlined it amazes me again and again i hardly rewatch any movies this is one of the few i do rewatch every other year it has everything you could ask for humour love thought action and nice visualstakes the dust of the gangstergenre by putting in more of a connection to the viewer we get to see shootouts drugs and prostitutes punches being thrown around etc yes but what we also get are relateable character which actions and motives are quite relateable it has a quite enjoyable sense of humour that is never misplaced which i imagine is very difficult in such a violent and emotional movie the leadroles all do an amazing job and help a lot to understand what the characters are feelingthe lovestory isnt that deep and rich but absolutely makes sense in the movie it is believable and you do want to see it flourish so it absolutely serves its purpose in the plotthe location is amazing the words fairytale town are used several times and that pretty much describes it pretty well the way it is shot and the time of the year christmas add a romantic but also cold and lonely touch to it lonely because bruges is a shithole the fairy tale theme is woven not only into the visuals but also some parts of the story can remind you of a fairy talesoundtrack is another aspect i love about this movie just like the plot the location and the character ray it adds to the feeling of this sad yet beautiful taleto top it off we get some stuff to ponder over atonement is a big deal here where is the line between good and evil what should you do if you did something horrible and so on all this is blended together so well that it has been one of my favorite movies for about 7 years now and im planning on watching it again some time,black_comedy
proof that stereotypes exist for a reason this film is a rare and touching study of what unites the englishman and the irishman ruthlessness humanity humour and fair play all at the same time excellentmaybe this explains why an irishman is captain of the england cricket team,black_comedy
has one of the best cathartic endings ive seen for a movieit was executed in a way that it changes the entire outlook of the movies first half where the narrative seemed simple at a surface level yet the emotions will certainly run deep upon viewing it on retrospectiveits deeply admirable that a comedy like this that is often bitingly unapologetic and dark can be fused with the movies humorous yet tragic examination of a mans inner turmoil guilt ones sin and his path to redemption through means of finding his own sanctuary through ironic terms,black_comedy
is a great comedy film that is peppered with true emotional scenes and great oneliners i really enjoyed watching this film as it gave me a real laugh and also really made me emotionally invest in all the characters especially ray and ken the way this film made me feel is very much down to the writing which is all the work of martin mcdonagh it is a shame he doesnt do more films as he knows how to write a great script i implore you to watch this and then watch seven psychopaths as they are both masterclasses on how to write an engaging plot with great character developmentthe plot then centres around two assassins ray and ken who go to bruges after a hit goes wrong there they take in the sights and await further instructions all hell breaks when ken is asked to kill ray i will not ruin anything else for you dear reader i will just say that things develop quite well and the pacing is solid some of the best scenes in this film are just of ray and ken talking to each other and the banter they have colin farrell is excellent in this film and plays ray really well there are scenes where he goes from joking with ken straight into crying about bad things he has done these scenes show off the talent he has as an actor and really gets you invested in ray and the tortured soul he is i always say a mark of a good actor is if he can cry convincingly and farrell does this really well another great performance is brenden gleeson who plays ken really well his character is as tortured as ray and it really shows in the performance gleeson gives he is more the serious type in this film whereas ray definitely is the comic relief that is not to say he has no funny lines everyone in this film does but you can tell he is the straight man ralph finnes as harry is brilliant and his character being the main antagonist moves the plot a long at a reasonable pace he has great lines like the first scene he is in the youre an inanimate fuing object scene which is to me one of the funniest and best put downs ive seen in a film its is delivered so well be finnes that the scene really gets you invested in his character from the start and you realise that he is a wellmeaning bad guy the actual cinematography of the film is great and gives you a real sense of bruges as a place and setting in fact the way it is shot gives the impression that bruges is not just a place but an actual character in the movies as well it gives a tone of old european cities so well in fact that i might have a holiday there in the future in a time when most hollywood films have a boring tone it is refreshing to see good tone and cinematography the music in this film is not very prevalent but it really doesnt have to be what makes this film good is the dialog and look of the film not the music which is only in the background and not at all the main focus of any scene in the film the music is only there to enhance certain scenes and that is all we need it to do the jokes are fuking hilarious and clever in this film honestly there are scenes in this film that had me crying with laughter the american tourist joke with the stairs is genius and a great bit of social commentary on fat annoying american tourists and their stereotypical mannerisms whilst abroad the best thing is that while these funny scenes and jokes are very entertaining they do not distract from any characters development the jokes enhance the characters for example ray is a funny character with some great comedic lines but it doesnt take away from the fact that he has done wrong in his life and you as the audience feel his repentance at all the bad things he has done this film is just brilliant and well worth a watch it goes without saying however the main thing that i found a problem with and it is a little problem is the lack of effort the supporting cast gives the midget was not a very well rounded character and chloe was not very inspiring as the lead female character in fact the pregnant woman who owns the hotel was better acting wise than heri think this film is brilliant with a great cast for the most part and a great story that is told in a clearly presented way the plot and characters make it so much more emotional that it becomes more than a comedy film i cant say enough good words about the script and i really do look forward to 2018s three billboards outside ebbing missouri which is the next film martin mcdonagh has written i would advise you to watch any film he has done as you will be entertained,black_comedy
i think my expectations were built up too high for this moviei kept hearing how amazing it was its a fine story with some great lines of well written humor but it felt a bit like a pulp fiction wannabe i think the biggest weakness is the ending having everyone just die isnt much of a resolution it makes we wonder why i invested the time following these characters for the last hour and a half everyone in the movie did a great job i liked mad eye moody as ken even though i didnt buy him as a killer for hire ralph fiennes gets to be the crazy crime boss like the one in sexy beast and he does it stylishly colin farrell carried the lead just fine i would have liked to have something to take away from my viewing rather than just have the movie stop but it was fun while it lasted,black_comedy
london hit men ray colin farrell and ken brendan gleeson are sent to bruges belgium to hid out by their boss harry waters ralph fiennes ray had accidentally killed an innocent child ken takes in the sights but ray would rather drink and go home they encounter a film crew with a racist midget and ray falls for chloe villette clmence posy ken is conflicted after harry contacts him with the new ordersits funny and dark martin mcdonagh has filled his film with a black comedic tone farrell fills it with his fidgety energy and troubled humanity hes also hilarious delivering mcdonaghs sharp insane dialog one is never sure if farrell is going to say something funny or hit somebody over the head or both gleeson provides the solid foundation,black_comedy
the plot is very well constructed containing essential elements of both tragedy and comedy a mixture resulting in a surprising acidity the characters are driven surrounded by the dream city of bruges through psychological conflicts both funny and desperatehowever is an excellent example of how an original and brilliant narrative can be undermined by overperformance of an actorabsolutely flawless interpretation of ralph fiennes in the role of harry fiennes is a rare actor with stunning versatility able to transform in both aberrant amon goeth schindlers list as the innocent justin quayle the constant gardener harry is no exception fiennes embodies with incredible easiness the surgical brutality of the character capturing his private moral principles with naturally this adds a fundamental coherence to the outcome of the film anagnorisis peripeteia without which no doubt all the work would collapsethe exact opposite can be said about colin farrell performance a desperate attempt to add a childish innocence to the character overrides his likelihood in other words an exaggerated performance inconsistent with the sobriety of fiennes and brendan gleeson probably a view shared solely by this writing considering the golden globes received by that performancei believe that the work of farrell data venia weighed in the assessment belittling by contrast an excellent narrative,black_comedy
i remember the marketing back in 2008 for its being sold as some farcical comedy it isnt and the movie made for a remarkably pleasant surprise colin farrells never been my cup of ea but i really liked him in this movie flawed character cheeky little sht hes got great personality and one of the movies biggest gifts is making you feel for two leads a pair of murderous hit men its a film full of foul language prostitutes and a dwarf and yet it excels at being both sad and rewardingsometimes its a quirky sightseeing tale others its a crime movie  but essentially its a dark comedy and a great one810,black_comedy
sometimes a movie comes along and surprises you years after the fact i didnt see this in 2008 but waited till 2015 and wow be prepared to view a comical nostalgic view of europe the bad guy comical sense of humor works well for my light hearted sensational interests this movie entertains and places you in another anxious context that will surprise you i believe this was not just well directed entertainment but well written as well id go action comedy and crime sometimes talent such as colin farrell rises to new levels because of his fellow cast i think this is what went on take a look at this movie and give it your honest review,black_comedy
irish hit men ray collin farrel and ken brendan gleeson have been ordered to hide out by their british boss harry ralph fines soon after ray botches up his first job and accidentally kills a little boy ken older and more experienced wants to make the best of the unfortunate circumstance by visiting bruges famous museums churches and canals while the young novice ray just wants to drink beer to overcome his guilt and forget that he is in fact is clever heartfelt and entertaining with a surprisingly fresh voice that challenges moral principles and questions the acceptance of violence in film without knowing mcdonaghs rsum as a playwright it is apparent that his writing is eloquent and full of energy the dialogue in this film is fantastic which helps with the pacing since the main plot points are exposed very early on additionally mcdonagh wrote bruges as one of the main characters in the movie and made the city an active participant in the story rather than a pretty background unlike many first time directors mcdonagh is not too eager to flash what he can do with the camera he beautifully photographs the picturesque old city without resorting to showy camera movements or angles that would have been distracting and even unnecessary instead the camera mimics a tourists behavior by lingering on ordinary subjects like streets and buildings as a result the visual contrast between the tranquil city and the turbulent hit men is strikinganother noteworthy aspect about is its unique approach to the gangsterhit man genre ray and ken are not the stereotypical hit men the stoic nonchalant jef costello in le samurai or the mysterious anton chigurh from no country for old men rather these two are quite ordinary they face surreal situations like getting into an argument about the cost of an entry which surprisingly does not result in the ticketseller being shot in the head they get nervous about first dates take contacts out before bed and get bored by sightseeing the intentionally anticlimactic scenes such as chases being halted so the pursuer can look at his map doing a countdown before a shootout or even complementing the gun being used to kill one another exist not only as a visual gag but also to humanize the charactersis not simply about guys with guns but about guys with guns who are conscious about their actions and operate by a set of principles harry is a gangster with principles and a man of honor who will go to the extreme to keep his word it is hard to believe the gentle softspoken ken kills people for a living its what i do he says although he is never seen killing anyone on screen ray is suicidal and understandably so and what is so refreshing about farrels character is how he repeatedly admits his crime and expresses his guilt the outstanding performance by the actors and the nuanced writing by mcdonagh underscore the subtle comedy and tragedy that ismartin mcdonagh is quickly catching the attention of many and deservingly so he does not exploit violence a major theme in his films and plays rather he confronts the audience with the moral dilemma of tolerating it and even being entertained by it has gained critical acclaim and a best screenplay oscar nomination but is a miss among moviegoers mainly because not a lot of people are aware of its existence it is a must see for dark comedy fans and anyone who enjoys an entertaining film with great dialogue and complex characters,black_comedy
is a 2008 film directed and written by oscar winner martin mcdonagh and i dont know why this man has only directed 2 feature films the movie follows two hitman that are sent to bruges by their boss to wait for further instructions after a hit gone wrong colin farell plays ray a young and obnoxious hitman who wants nothing more than to leave bruges and never come back brendan gleeson plays ken rays more older experienced partner who wants to take in the beauty of the city while they are there both of the characters play off of each other in a hilarious way and it adds to the black comedy of the movie ralph finnes especially shines even though he does not show up until 75 into the film thats my brief rundown now for spoiler timewarning do not read if you have not seen spoilers below i especially enjoyed the third act of the film and thought it was a fantastic climax the ending showed death redemption sacrifice humor and most importantly dreams it wasnt until a second watch that i started to notice the theme of dreams recurring in the film the character chloe said that the movie that was being shot with the midgets was a dream sequence and when harry asked ken on the phone what ray thought of bruges ken said ray called it dreamlike and the finale of the film takes place in this dream sequence movie set i am probably reading too much into this but maybe was rays test to redeem himself and he succeeded sending him to heaven at the end of the film and the dream messages were telling us that the entire film is a dream and it is only god testing ray or something keep in mind this is coming from and atheist i think this is a cool theory to think of even though it is probably all a stupid coincidencethis movie has probably one of the best screenplays of recent times the dialog between the main two characters can be hilarious dramatic and even sad when it needs to be the writer and director martin mcdonagh has a great way of grabbing the audience and not letting go his great work on this film allows the audience to feel completely immersed in the film dont even take my word for it roger ebert gave it 4 stars and called it a fantastic character study the movie is on netflix instant and vod if youre looking for a funny thrilling sad heartwarming good time definitely check out,black_comedy
dialog was very enjoyable and the script was excellent when you take this subject matter and try to put it on film it sounds like a ridiculous task but it works  professional killers with a sense of humor and heart really yes really the only complaint i had was that the actors were difficult to understand at times with their accentsvery entertaining film with witty characters usually not a huge firth fan but he did a nice job and his character was likable i did enjoy the mix of humor fear despair and genuine concern for the charactersrated an 810 because of the script,black_comedy
this was a good dark comedy couldve have been great the casting was on pointexcept for the girl she was 2 dimensional and not fully actualized she was a moot point in the movie and couldve been played without any words being spoken at all and still would have come across the same way the dwarf didnt go too gimmicky like movies usually portray them however the other characters were preformed beautifully the writing was excellent sometimes almost tipping into cheesy however the acting brought it back from tipping over it starts off a little too slow but slowly rolls into a more interesting film the only flaw in the movie is that the rhythm feels more like a mini series more so than a movie,black_comedy
looks on the surface to be a typical english dark comedythriller in the vein of early guy ritchie watch it and experience something absolutely phenomenal i beg you dont let this one pass you by is painfully hilarious and painfully sad at the exact same time imagine crying through your tears yeah it pretty much sums this movie up it uses its criminal characters to observe the delicacy of life and the excruciating consequence of one horrible mistake yet these characters are so tragic that when they go for a laugh youre roaring laughter and sadness intertwine so well isnt it a mystery why,black_comedy
the first thing you realise about is that its a very good tourist advertisement for the city its almost too easy for the set designer lavish old churches amongst medieval architecture cobblestone streets gorgeous canals a dainty market square beneath the beautiful setting is a dark and twisted comedy that manages to say quite a lot irish playwright martin mcdonaghs dialogue is at times reminiscent of pulp fictions being snappy cynical often irrelevant but its very important in establishing the relationship between two hit men in ray and kenfarrell gives a wonderfully nuanced performance as the younger of the pair the opening narration tells us of his cardinal sin in murder but its much later that we find out that he also accidentally killed an innocent young boy in the process and that it was his first contracted kill farrell manages to portray these without ever explicitly telling the audience his performance is one of great range and character on the surface he is bored impatient brutally dismissive honest that american did have a heart attack at the top of the tower and cynical but theres also moments of innocence and wonder and childhood that he exhibits which makes it more clear the gravity of his situation and sin at heart ray is not a bad man simply one on the wrong path ken brendon gleeson is the only one who recognises this theres not too much in common with the pair snappy exchanges showcase the very apparent difference between the twos idea of a good holiday and just a waste of time mcdonagh manages to give a visually breathtaking and interesting tour of bruges all while establishing the relationship and the plot they discuss heaven hell and purgatory at the art museum a thin veil for the hit mens pondering of morality and clash when ray refuses to go up and see the view at the bell tower while ken pays his 5 euro each scene of the tightly knitted screenplay is crucial to the climax of the film every last detail significant theres a running motif between the criminals of the film in the pair and their boss harry ralph fiennes plays a calm but unbalanced mob boss unflinching in his duty but all the same possessing a moral compass like the other two mcdonagh expresses this with humorous dialogue which is driven purely by character both harry and ray are impulsively violent when need be but in sight of the pregnant marie their softer personalities come out its a clever and almost exasperating scene which wouldnt normally be in a film as they time the start of their action sequence in unison there is clearly a line that even these men wont cross ken reaches this with the realisation of rays impeding suicide despite initially agreeing to kill him as a result of his debt to harry its a wonderfully ironic twist which again is driven by wonderful acting and dialogue im not allowed to and you are hows that fair all three characters possess an underlying complexity beyond just the simply criminal life of killing people ken doesnt even commit any murders in the entire film in fact only killing himself in an attempt to save ray his life debt trust and integrity to harry is undone when he realises that the reasonably untainted ray has the capacity to be something better no more prominent an example of the code that they possess is harrys suicide at the end which hammers down the main thematic virtue the sort of innocence and purity that is symbolically represented in the boy and seen in glimpses of ray must remain clean of bloodstain and ruin harry kills himself when realising what hes done ironically the victim is the very opposite of the ideal a drug addicted dwarf who hires prostitutes the significant act is in ray who frantically tries to correct this act and spare harry even as he is dying by his hand rays characters progression is complex foreshadowed and consequential even whining endlessly at the beginning at being stuck for two weeks he shows no real purpose desire or destination his ambitions are simple and sensual in nature chasing after a beautiful women and stealing drugs this aimless perspective is marred by the sincerity of the guilt at the back of his mind showcased sparingly but in raw and genuine moments of emotional regret by farrell like when he breaks down at the playground in the ambulance he finally decides on a goal to find the mother of the boy and accept her punishment its the first time in the entire film we see resolve to live and its the culmination of the hints of moral goodness that we know ray is possible of the ending is purposefully ambiguous on whether he does manage to reach that goal much better than the one in the original screenplay which has him contemplating suicide once again only to hesitate when chloe rings him for ray the fairytale city of bruges is a complete nightmare its a 2 week purgatory which constantly eats away at his conscience and reminds him of his guilt one way or another he must escape manages to deftly balance the lighthearted humorous side of the situation and of the characters with the subtext of selfhatred anguish and cardinal sin its a thematically complex character study filled with stark juxtapositions of the poignant and the absurd most will find it as charming as the fairytale city that it is set in,black_comedy
what a great movie flawless in anyway colin farrell is in his best performance it is natural funny and kinda loose its brilliant brendan gleeson was perfect supporting colins work both in the deepsad and the funnynonsense times ralph fiennes was also pretty good in the few minutes he was on screen as i said this movie is flawless im not saying that its the best movie ever made or anything but it is one of few movies that you feel like what you see is exactly what the director wanted you to see the sad dialogs the dark humor the politeness and rudeness all of it felt like right it might not please everyone principally the belgians from bruges for his black comedy and the constant unnecessary swearing the story is excellent the cast worked brilliantly the director had his great work of art i feel the need to swear a little bit in a homage to the movie i apologize to anyone who get upset about something in this review both before and after this point this film is fcking awesome colin fckin farrell is fcking amazing in this sht and you must see if you are from fcking bruges wherever the fck bruges is,black_comedy
this is a brilliant essentially flawless moviereally cinema raised up to the level of true art and poetry so why arent i rating it a full ten because while i like black comedies and this definitely qualifies as one of the best it was just too grim for me at least on the night i watched it everything about this movie is really great but it is really black and not in a playful or tongueincheek way but in a very dark contemplative fashion the comedy is pretty good but only interspersed here and there and is not a dominant part of this movie without a doubt this is a superb movie but it is essentially a serious sort of philosophical movie with a fair amount harsh and realistic violence as long as you know what you are getting yourself into youll likely enjoy this movie but be forewarned it is much more black than comedy,black_comedy
 the three fat americans that was laughed by ray at the beginning of the story ended it up one of them had heart attack this was when harry and ken try to go upstairs to fight each other the doorman told them its close because some american had heart attacks  ray and the girl had dinner at the restaurant ray was trying to be rude to make fun of the canadians but he didnt know he thought they were americans so that he said something about vietnamese he realized it after he got caught on the train departing from bruges  the doorman stopped ken at once he wants to spend all his coins its the coins that let him finish his last plan throw it to get someone notice it from the tower and so that he could kill himself with no one hurt  before ray could blow harrys head off from the stairs he hesitated because he was afraid of murder another baby  and of course most importantly at last harry shot at ray and blew the little boys head off he couldnt see the head all he saw is the kid style clothing and this showed up when ray came out from the prison talking to the girl in an out door bar  at the restaurant ray and the girl talked about what they do for living when ray asked do i be looked i shoot people the girl answered no only children ray was so embarrassed that he grabbed the glass of wine this what i think also let ray feel more insecure that he decided to suicide the next day reviewevery story can be told well but an amazing story needs to have a lot of hints and key points that are leading the story to be more integrated truly is one of my favorite films the overall ideology has been really well clarified the rhythm of the content is very interesting and audiencefriendly i get the sense of humor as well,black_comedy
okay so unless youre into very slowpaced movies and whispering dialogue mixed with bashing americansyoull hate this movie or at least fall asleep to it while watching it this is your typical british comedydrama with an embarrassing attempt at being comical i know all movies shouldnt be a generic americanstyle action movie but ive seriously never seen a dramacomedythriller this awful particularly a british one trainspotting was brilliant snatch was amazingetc i usually dont mind movies picking fun at other nationalities but the way they did it to the americans was outright ridiculous and even stood out as being irrelevant to the storyline save yourself some time and watch something else i was certainly fooled by the reviews and ratings into wasting a portion of my life watching this abomination of a film,black_comedy
great beginning heavy english accent everything very promising as seen in funny brutal english flicks i am a big fan of lock stock snatch fight club whatever movie you name with bad moral and funny bad people killing other not so funny bad peopleis slower it promises and actually has more character more european scenery but to what end all abnormally amoral films like the ones name before live up to a glorious and cynical ending not so this one the climax is of extraordinary bad taste and humor me flinching and not laughing at allthe first movie in a long time i stopped watching before the end avoid it,black_comedy
playwright mcdonaughs debut feature works only up to a point as a crime comedy however considering up to what point is quite remarkable featuring a supporting cast ranging from quirky eurotrash and plain old jolly eccentrics but as a moral drama its almost as top of the pops one could ask for the trailer didnt make it seem as such then again it is hard to express the kind of conundrum that the main characters get themselves into while also appealing to a base of fans that love quiptype one liners ie youre a bunch of bleeping elephants or if i was retarded or grew up on a farm bruges would impress me but i didnt so im not impressed when is at its best and until its selfconsciously symbolic touches in the last five minutes it usually is at its best whatever that means it expresses what i love seeing in films about career criminals the total inner turmoil of what was done coming back to haunt the person if its true that no good deed goes unpunished the same would probably go for bad deeds in the world of where the atmosphere of the practically medieval city is the character ken observes like a fairytale and a sharp contrast to the dark side pervading ken ray and harrythe basic thrust of the plot is that ray half wiseass womanizer and half halfsuicidal played by farrell did a job back in london a murder which went horribly wrong in just one misstep i wont reveal it here though i should except to say that its one of those cardinal rules career criminalshit men have to stick to and so he and the older less cynical ken gleeson who seems to be one of the most honest looking types in the character actor world a spoton casting choice are sent to bruges to receive more instructions but those instructions sent by the easily angered harry ralph fiennes doing almost a hilarious imitation of kingskey in sexy beast arent followed through and then some manner of chaos ensueshere and there mcdonaugh takes what appears to be a lackadaisical attitude to the characters in this otherwise tense and uncertain fatalistic situation as if an oddmatched comic duo are in a place one likes and one only can stand for mocking midgets scuse me dwarfs in moviemaking and hitting on the one hot girl in all of bruges but its such a strange form that mcdonaugh is working with here with its mix of tones that it suddenly feels in the context of the slightly bizarre and chilling circumstances truthful it goes without saying the cast helps give the material a boost and that mcdonaugh doesnt throw too many outofleftfield curve balls with the plot if he does its not of the sort we know were usually hitting in this kind of crime story loaded with gallows humor and catholic redemption minisagain short if i were a bloke in britain or a fella in dublin or a dupe as a writer this is the kind of stuff id immediately try to go for its smart serious mature genre work that relies on just enough bloodshed and violence and trauma to haunt its audience proper and do its duty to supply another batch of wonderfully offkilter comedy scenes for fans of british gangster flicks that this is nowhere near as shallow as a ritchie pic goes without saying,black_comedy
i headed into my screening of the new colin farrellbrendan gleeson film wanting to like the film as much as any film i have travelled a distance to experience this yeari am one of the few that think farrells interviews over the years have been far better than any of his performances but gleeson is someone that i have admired since he stole a few scenes from gibson and the gang back in 1995s braveheartputting the two irishmen together in a film ripe with violence and humour was as welcomed into my days itinerary as that favourite uncle that always came to the house bearing giftsbut when the full experience came to a close i was left feeling like i opened up the gift only to find a rattle rapped inside a knitted sweaterstars farrell and gleeson as ray and ken two hit men hiding out in the brussels town of bruges after rays first assignment suffers some collateral damage the two couldnt be more opposite ken is the elder fatherlike figure that would spend his days traveling the city and taking in the historical sites and buildings ray is the cynical partner and comic relief that prefers to chase skirts and head to the local pub for a pint or two of local lager together the two are frick and frack murtaugh and riggs lee and carterwith not much going on in the small town the two seem to squeeze their entertainment value out of the locals thanks to large consumptions of beer some cocaine and quirky acquaintances that provide leisurely distractions to both ray and ken as they await further instruction from crime boss harry ralph fiennes particularly small man jordan prentice as jimmy as a midget on location shooting a dream sequence in a film jimmy provides all the laughs that dont come from rays adolescent behaviourthe fun and games take a turn for the serious when harry orders ken to off ray as punishment for the hit that resulted in complications unfortunately this is also where the film turns predictable you know just know that ken is not going to kill his apprentice ray and that harry would end up having to come to town himself to rid himself of now two problemsand this all takes us to a bloody finale that should have been more fun that its conclusion and more satisfying than its endingi definitely cannot fault the writing via a screenplay from director marin mcdonagh who at one time had more oscars with one than martin scorsese when ray utters such nonpolitically correct phrases as if id grown up on a farm and was retarded bruges might impress me but i didnt so it doesnt i could imagine farrell and gleeson sitting around a script reading table laughing uncontrollably over the audacity of the lines that are played with quick witted precision in front of the camerabut the film from top to bottom confused me and left me bouncing off the walls trying to figure out what type of film it was trying to become it started off with the black humour and utter ignorance of a payback then went into a lethal weapon buddybuddy film only to change pace and go incredible serious leading up to the final chapters that were more bloody than most of the horrors i have seen in recent weeksfor all that i cannot give a recommendation it is one of those few films that i do expect to watch again on dvd and i hope i can be swayed into seeing the film for the individual parts even if they dont flow together cohesively but in the meantime i recommend that you dont go to bruges but you stay at home and do a virtual tour on the internet insteadwwwrobertsreviewscom,black_comedy
this would have made a good 45 minute one off tv show there wasnt enough material here for a full blown film the acting was fine but the script was poor the story was interesting but had too many clumsy plot devices the whole love interest was just a set up to arm ray the subplot concerning the dwarfmidgetsmall person was pretty pointless too i was expecting an intelligent thriller and got a really boring and over long film instead was it longer than the average movie maybe not but it did seem so i was bored throughout and just wished they would kill each other and get it over withif you have to see it then please wait for it to be shown on tv or borrow it from some poor fool who bought the dvdme i bought my copy from amazon and will be relisting it today,black_comedy
director martin mcdonagh says he was inspired to make after being stranded in the city and concluding it was beautiful but boring i know the feeling stuck there as a 15 yearold on a school trip my classmates and i spent the day following round the hapless bloke in the yellow suit on the day that mcdonalds were launching chicken mcnuggets got rave reviews but i fancy my own story is no worse than a rather underwhelming tale of two hit men i found the comedy thin the characters unappealing and their motivation unbelievable and the ending predictable a clichd gangster movie isnt any less so just because it has a historic setting i think my adult self might think more of the city but this movie left me cold,black_comedy
was one of those movies you could see becoming great from a distance the trailer definitely showed promise and the cast and concept seemed good a while went and i forgot about it but then it suddenly movie popped up again so of course i went to see itnot really sure what to expect other than colin farell and old guy and ralph fiennes interacting in the bizarre location of bruges belgium the movie was a delightful surprise there is a good dose of humour dark and somewhat lighter and theres more humanity than in all of hollywoods summer blockbusters combinedsuperficially a slow actioner is a morality play which shows the newcomer directors background in the theater the interaction between the characters the amazing twists and turns of the story and the great acting between the three lead menbrendan gleeson a surprise to me his harry potter role did not impress but how could it have is the main thing to expect from this movie with a clever and exciting climactic ending to top it offif you liked kiss kiss bang bang or layer cake or any other subtle offbeat dark comedy then this is definitely for you beware of blood and violence at some parts and heavy themes at others this is not a movie to take lightly but give it a chance its worth it,black_comedy
 two hitman named ken and ray brendan gleeson and colin ferrell respectively are ordered by boss harry the always excellent ralph fiennes to go to bruges a quaint little nothing town in belgium ken enjoys the sights but ray doesnt soon ken gets orders to kill ray for botching a jobthis is a gem of a movie both hilarious and suspenseful it has the comedy that can only come from european sensibilities good writing and careful story arcing that sort of thing the directing and editing are also of notice the film also has the good sense to keep things down to earth which actually makes it all the funnier colin ferrell is twitchy irritable and has no control over his tongue while brendan gleesons character is a sober dignified calm soul ralph fiennes plays a foulmouthed straightforward assassin with a code of honor he needs to do more films like this he more or less steals every scene hes in without even tryingon a sidenote i wonder how this will affect tourism despite rays constant putdowns of the city and one horrid joke about belgium but never mind that probably in the positive for all press is good press the city for its medieval quaintness practically is a character in the film the movie will probably raise peoples awareness of the city in any case its an impeccably plotted storyarc with dramatic moments almost as powerful as the laugh out loud moments and lord were there manyhilarious and overall enjoyable gets an a,black_comedy
i have a hard time finding credibility with anyone who references larry the cable guy and thinks that if there is a dwarf in an independent film it must be peter dinklagei saw this movie last night and thoroughly enjoyed it not since pulp fiction have i seen a movie combine humor violence and a cast of tragic characters so well look you cant compare the two to say this was as good or better than pulp fiction it isnt period pulp fiction is regarded so highly because it was so unique and interesting for the time this movie isnt trying to be pulp fiction it doesnt stretch and grasp at the absurd the way a movie like boondock saints which in the grand scheme loses points for trying so hardthis movie is full of laughs violence that is surprising and makes you uncomfortable about what you just saw and an ending comparable to a shakespearean tragedysome of it is a little predictable but that predictability is offset by the few times when the film does manage to shock you enjoy this movie for what it is you will be entertained and its definitely worth the price of a ticket,black_comedy
apparently i grew up on a farm because impresses me very much directed by martin mcdonagh the film is an interesting character driven movie the characters in this movie are as human and fully fleshed out as it gets a really dark comedy the film is about two irish hit men ray colin farrell and ken brendan gleeson going into hiding in the belgian city of bruges after a hit went horrible wrong they are waiting for a phone call from their violent crime boss with unbending principles harry ralph fiennes for further actions the city of bruges become a center point of the plot as both see it in different ways ray sees the oldest well preserved medieval city as boring and a personal hell nightmare for him wanting to get out of it while immature and his youth showing ray throughout the film is plunges into a state of depression and a torturous emotional experience guilt for the hit going bad without spoiling it he understand he violated moral standards of his crime and looks for a way out by extreme pleasure only to find himself paralyzed more to the guilt ken the wiser of the two sees the city as a dream due to its old buildings architecture and the rich history of its streets like samuel becketts waiting for godot novel the two characters play off each other on everything from living life to how to die in what to do while waiting for harry ray wants to party it up with a drugdealer love interest chloe clmence posy and dwarf actor jimmy jordan prentice while ken wants to go siteseeing the film is rich with symbolism and ideas i love the film within a film notice such in the way ray met chloe and jimmy a dream sequence kinda out of pastiche or homage of nicholas roegs dont look now a nod of the head the whole scene would foreshadow a lot of the end the arrival of the phone call is the films climatic moment as it put the film into motion a nice reference by showing the opening shots of touch of evil is clue thats things will not end well for the two the movie is about the conflict of principles harry is play out as the grim reaper of the film as he thinks that anybody who did the same crime that ray does deserves to die ken acting as the guardian angel believes people has the capacity to change and deserves a second chance its a human struggle of how to seek justice by having the medieval city as a background all three of men represent the both extreme of religionist viewpoints on how justice is served when ray and ken visit the art museum and look upon the last judgment painting by hieronymous bosch they walk into a surreal dream somehow how purgatory might be looked at based on irish mythology the idea of waiting for their inevitable fate in an unknown land is a common theme in philosophical irish literature when ray look upon the painting the flaying of sisamnes by gerard david we knew that the guilt was eaten himself him ripping him apart all the actors did pretty well in this film colin farrells character is somewhat likable but i found myself not caring much about his fate due to some really annoying prickly jerk moments it kindly turn me off the film i found myself relating more to the ken character because he had more a moral code then again the movie didnt had any heroes much to root for its perfectly alright to kill people but dont you dare accidentally shot a kid what type of moral code is this film presenting i found myself choosing the less of two evils the hope of redemption and forgiveness is held out by ken to ray doesnt resolve as this film gives bloodsplattering conclusion where nobody wins i dont think ray learn anything besides wanting to live hes doesnt seem like he wants to live to do better its seem he want to live for lust or fear of dying reasons hints why i found chloe to be a really horrible character brendan gleeson display one of the best performance i ever saw of him ralph fiennes is just brilliant the twisted humor is a hit and miss i found myself laughing in a few meanspirited jokes and at others not at all i did like the comedy of errors the pacing is good each scene didnt seem like a filler as it serve its purpose and move on quickly i did find it dragging in the pointless dwarf hooker party scene i did love the perfect irony ending the film was nominated for best original screenplay award at the 81st academy awards in 2009 and i can see why it was wellwritten maybe a bit too nihilism for my taste the violent and gore was alright not to cheesy nor unrealistic the jump from belfry tower of bruges was a bit out there gross the language was alright for a gangster flick but i did find harry fbomb letter just too cartoony the music score by carter burwell is forgettable and disappointed i cant remember a damn thing about it as a travelogue i think the film is most impression as i didnt know much about bruges before this film the camera shots are great high angle shots are used on church item creating the impression that religion will be theme throughout the duration of the film looking down on the characters close ups are great to show the coping of the aftermath of mistakes mise en scene for the dreaming scenes overall worth seeing no matter if youre or not,black_comedy
im a fan and i dont mind the violence which is an essential part of a film about hit men the characters are violent men but we see that they all have a softer side the darkness at the heart of even a beautiful place like the touristy city of bruges is evident and although the city is shown in all its beauty im ready to believe that there is indeed a seedier side  there always is in any place of beautycolin farrells performance is excellent as is brendan gleeson and of course ralph fiennes the supporting cast are also very good and the balance of humour and tragedy is satisfying i also think the ending is great unexpected and appropriatei have been to bruges several times and it is exactly like that except hopefully without the violence i recommend this film to anyone with an open mind who appreciates lovely architecture dark humour and doesnt mind very strong language,black_comedy
is a truly wonderful film set in belgium  starring colin farrell ralph fiennes and one of the greatest performances from the past 5 years in cinema from brendan gleeson the plot in brief is two irish assassins are sent to a hide out after a mission gone awry with little or no idea of their objectives out in belgium after some sightseeing their boss gets in contact and the whole dynamic of the film is shaken as emotions of hate selfloathing and prevailing love and compassion become apparent the film spirals into a grandiose tarantino esque encounterthe action takes awhile to come in meaningfully fitted into the narrative and unlike so many other modern day pictures never needs to be excused fortheres plenty of gripping intense and highly emotional scenes at its apex felt in one of the most poignant moments of the past decade in film involving brendan gleeson and a perfectly chosen track from the dubliners whether its the soundtrack or cast this film has celtic blood coursing through its veins and no matter how alien the surroundings are this iconic scene couldnt have been more pertinent with regard to the overarching theme i may just have had a tear in my eyeand whether its midgets in dreamlike art house productions in the cobbled streets of bruges or fat snooty elephants or americans walking up a narrow staircase the dark humour is great and will certainly satisfy those in hunger of satire amongst the morbidity bursting at the seams of the piecefor anyone who has seen sexy beast fiennes is the ben kingsley equivalent the rabid mob boss with a bloodlust but not without a conscience this film is too clever to deal in the absolutes good vs evil of traditional hollywood the moral compass wavers throughout and becomes a confrontation based on outlooks over complex subjects like retribution and punishment grounded where no one is of the divinethe cinematography is breathtaking and the whole plot feels very shakespearean as a modestly sized ensemble of characters are weaved into the film always with a purposeand perhaps most of all i finally got colin farrell,black_comedy
i love this film and have seen it a number of times it has many superlative elements and one flawthe story is compelling and laden with themes the use of brugge as purgatory is encapsulated in the scene where ray and ken meditate upon the last judgement by bosch the theme that nice men can do bad things recurs a nod an homage is too strong to dont look now and another nod to nosferatu the vampyre as harry in silhouette pistol whips the attendant of the brugge belfry kens own redemption attempting to redeem ray shows that its never too late to change the path you have chosen harry also a bad man remains an honourable man youve got to stick to your principles im sorry i called you an inanimate object the ultimate revelation that the midgets role is central and is not a picaresque conceit is masterly the brilliant dialogue and the haunting score especially der leiermann illustrate that carter burwell really understood the film and endow the film with a congruence that is all too rarethe flaw that self referential bit when harry tells marie that this is the shoot out it jars but its like grit in an oyster emphasising the overall brilliance of this film,black_comedy
had no doubts giving this one an 810 just back recently from a cumbersome rating dilemma which saw me settle for a similar score for pans labyrinth which further strengthens my stand that imdb should let us vote with more accuracy for example 77 what pans labyrinth shouldve deserved i loved i thought there really was nothing wrong with it how the dark elements were incorporated into the film as well as the mesmerizingly haunting soundtrack that just weaved into everything nice and well colin farrell did surprisingly well with his native irish tongue it was all set up for him to nail the role brendan gleeson does well in his role too ralph fiennes does a stellar job being cast as the boss harry waters classically and stylishly encompassing the character blatantly or so he is extremely comparable to ben kingsley in sexy beast the magnificence of the belgian surroundings coupled with the soundtrack is what really brings this movie along the screenplay is also equally matched if not better i would recommend to all whove seen one too many of the usual stuff in the days of transformers and 2012 and cgi this is refreshingly engaging to those who appreciate the art of a good movie,black_comedy
this film is simplybrilliant from the cinematography to the dialogue to the acting each area of this film is done to perfection the story is brilliant the acting is genuine and the script is hilarious enjoy i hate to go on and on about how good this film is but apparently you must write 10 lines of text so thats the reason why im elaborating on my original first paragraphthe best thing about this film for me was definitely ralph fienes  his comedic timing is top notch warning this film is violentthe films dialogue is quick sharp and very very witty colin farrel is superb  his crying is really heartfelt as is his understandable grieve over a major plot device that occurs early on the film although this film is brilliant i have only given it 4 as oppose to 5 as i felt the film became a little drawn out towards the end plus i would have preferred a more conclusive ending that the one that was presented to the audience despite this the film is still great and one i would certainly recommend any persons reading this review to check out,black_comedy
what a fantastic little movie and i mean no disrespect by using the epithetic little in fact its a word that conveys extremely well the charm of this film set in a small town in belgium bruges one of the unlikeliest but cleverest settings of a crime film even the title couldnt have been more eloquent since the whole point of the film is that two irish hit men are basically spending time waiting for their boss instructions after a botched job while one of the two protagonists brendan gleeson as the calm and moderate ken takes the opportunity to do the most normal thing we would do in a touristic place his younger partner and friend ray colin farrell more freespirited and tormented impatiently thinks of leaving the towntheres a melancholic feeling inhabiting the first part of the film as if were waiting for something to happen the action takes its time  but that didnt bother me at all the pacings slowness gives us enough time to follow the characters and understand their personalities and in the specific case of ray the big trauma that tortures his mind and might have something to do with their waiting and as the film progresses you realize that rays pain reveals another one even subtler hidden in kens heart its a film with an unexpected depth that doesnt distract from the whole comedic atmosphere and reveals what is for me one of the best written scripts of the last decade actually i still wonder if i saw a black humor comedy or a lighthearted drama but in both cases i know ive seen one of the most unconventionally original films which is hard not to review without sounding like a pompous criticso  what i loved the most about is this little universe it created something very distinctive that i cant compare with any other film a unique atmosphere where tourists actors thieves prostitutes meet together and discuss everyday or futile matters like we do in reallife when we go visit a foreign place its a cinematic meltingpot made of curiosity discovery and knowledge creating a supplementary delight while watching the film as if the town was a character we learn about it too and thats how the movie works first as a comedic medley of all the intriguing and entertaining situations we face while visiting a foreign country something that gives the impression of an episodic and nonlinear story but the power of the script is that all these situations evolve crescendo and then finally combine for a totally satisfying and gripping climax even more gripping because it took time to come to this situation where the official antagonist appears ralph fiennes as harry the boss with some serious anger managements problem we know we are getting closer to a memorable shootout and a movie as original as couldnt have disappointedbut i dont want to spoil anything from that movie just to say that the performances from gleeson farrell and fiennes are absolutely amazing and convincing in their mix of goofy seriousness and melancholic depth in many moments all through the film especially in the scenes featuring ken and ray you never cease to feel extreme empathy for these people whose presence seems to serve a purpose that goes beyond the mission as if it meant something even deeper strangely deeper they cant even figure what  as if bruges was in the crossroads of these fates where something new was going to explode from these cocktails of feelings of traumas and repressions like those kind of holidays where we do change from redemption or alienation or both  but this is not a movie to overanalyze the intellectual approach is smoothly invited near the ending when we collect the right pieces of the puzzle and wait for us to find the last the most precious piece which still relies on the central characters soul rayray is not necessarily deeper than ken and at many points ken is the most likely to get our sympathy but what makes ray more interesting is the way hes highlighted and foiled by the people he meets ray makes us encounter strange and unforgettable characters in a way that seems to go nowhere like the very trip in a random place named bruges and the greatness of that film is to make you wait until the end before you realize they couldnt have chosen a better place to live this adventure as the quintessential charm of the apparent insignificance which offers the best setting to explore our lives own insignificance until the ultimate realization that some things must change damn whenever i try to praise the comedy i end up talking about a dramaindeed seems to be more a lighthearted drama that transcends the dramatic element and translate it into something so deeply funny that youre never quite sure if you should laugh or cry but why hesitating the barrier between the two is so tight you can go back and forth from one emotion to another without feeling any emotional jetlag and like the story the emotions provided gets more and more intriguing and disturbing until they culminate in a tower where comedy thrones hand in hand with the psychological thriller in a bloody honeymoon in a small town named bruges  bruges finally put in the belgian map in belgium the country that man bites dog another masterpiece of black comedy put in the map too  bruges as the crossroads of destinies or deadend or both  bruges as the town we hate so much we just cant live in but cant leave it either

it seems odd to start with a films score but the impact that carter burwells work has on this film should not go unnoticed his scoring creates a mood throughout that to paraphrase from the film puts the film somewhere between reality and a dream much of the time  its that good ralph fiennes is brilliant and is reminiscent of kingsley in sexy beast  brutally principled and seemingly perpetually angry brendan gleeson also contributes a strong performance i was prepared to not like farrell but in reality he strikes a good balance between lackadaisical thuggery and poignant vulnerabilityi tried to think of who mightve done better in the role actors like ewan mcgregor for instance but actually i couldnt think of any ewan included the movie itself strikes that same balance that farrells character does the relatively few scenes of violence are bloody blunt and realistic there are some very funny moments and humor drifts throughout in pubs and plazas bruges is charmingly old world  the film is as appealing to the eye as the score is to the ear matters of awful gravity like the killing of children and violence against women somehow dont drag the film down to an unenjoyable depth the film stirs thoughts of situational ethics and that there compelling the viewer to consider what one believes makes it a worthy watch the preciousness and corrigibility of youth and the sacred status of the expecting mother juxtaposed with mercenary violence  well done,black_comedy
after watching 5 minutes i knew that this will be a great movie great conversations great music great atmosphere 3 of the most important things for me when it comes to moviesthe only thing that stroke me as a bit odd was the character colin has been playing a naive childish consciencesmitten killer with a short temper and a disposition to violence even though he was childish and naive he still was skilled at flirting and decently witty an impossible to play character collin farrel made the best out of itmy other problem has been the story the story isnt too bad but i found it had too many coincidences but if you dont really pay attention and if you dont have to analyze everything to death as i tend to do you will probably not notice how empty the story is simply because it is told quite well if you are a fan of cool gangster movies like tarentino movies this might be for you its a great movie but its not as witty as a tarentino movie and sometimes the conversations seem a bit too odd,black_comedy
many critics reviews of have given somewhat faint praise to the film for freshening up a bit the dying genre of the glib gangster flick but this does an incredible disservice to such an insightful and thoughtprovoking and big film as and it is a very big film the biggest ive seen in years  a film of big ideas and by contrast a film just as adept at meditations on the innumerable small details of real life its a film as big as life and not bound by any easy comparison to any single identifiable film genre its even bigger than real life delving effortlessly past the smug external demeanor of a young hoodlum and into the dreams and nightmares of his tortured soul this is simply colin farrells greatest role that i am personally aware of previously i thought he was just some sort of brooding poser not to mention poofter is that the brit term  some sort of marketinggenerated icon for the gays and gals complete with scruffy fashion and face growth and cute accent but after this role his sins are forgiven and he is redeemed like his character is he immediately gets sean connery stature in my book brendan gleason is terrific as wellbut as to a reexamination of the gangster ethos in general here is something quite remarkable the film makes us to truly understand how that world is inherently a world of authority no different than any other government and the men that occupy that world kill other men only because they deserve to be killed at least in the estimation of the authorities of that world who are to be obeyed however things like killing children and suicide are morally unconscionable to them just like they are to most people and the men of that world are in fact real people that need to be redeemed and are in fact redeemable  not in some simplistic revival meeting kind of way but via a path as complex as circuitous as the world they have voluntarily chosen to inhabit but a path that is ultimately compelling and believable in the process though some of them with the strictest moral codes do not find salvation this is in such marked contrast to previous films like the godfather in which the catholic church for example is just an elaborate prop and backdrop exploited by proud and callous men to bolster a false appearance of stability and respectability consider michael corleone staring stonefaced through his infant sons christening while having all his enemies whacked truly humanizes gangsters in a way that has simply never been accomplished before in any other film is this romanticism or realism it feels like the latterbut what is remarkable is how that emotional realism is achieved in the context of a vivid psychological and cinematic dreamscape of bruges a place that is nevertheless quite real a cloistered world existing in a modern one  oh well i could pile on some more metaphors but its late great flick though really great a lot greater than many braindead critics in the external reviews above give it credit for so many great scenes  farrell gazing out from the train as he leaves bruges at a dismal marshstrewn landscape with overcast skies a landscape reflecting the state of his own soul the young boy accidentally killed while waiting for the priest still clutching his handprinted list of sins to confess 1 being moody 2being bad at maths 3being too sad and yet throughout the film the unforced humor that emerges time after time in spite of all this its a film of vast range and ambition its such an inexplicable disservice to compare it to a selfconscious genre flick like pulp fiction not to say pulp fiction is bad maybe this film is better watched alone than in a drunken crowd at sundance i dont know four out of four stars,black_comedy
so im flicking through the pay channels last night and came across this movie just after the credits rolled i see collin farrel and go hey i like that actor i think ill watch i was immediately grabbed by the surreal dialog that goes on this screen play was a work of genius i dont know who martin mcdonagh is but i will be looking for what else he does and see it im not sure how to say it but it has the right mix of drama and comedy that had me staying up until 1am on the week day and i have 4 kids the cast was awesome colin farrel plays the tortured soul of a hit man trying to come to terms with a hit gone bad and hating being brendan gleeson plays the other hit man who loves bruges and wants to tour the town the banter and dialog between the two of them and the town folks had me riveted and laughing for 2 hours then half way through ralph fiennes pops up in the movie ralph fiennes the twists and turns this movie makes blew me away 910 i only did the 9 because i guessed part of the ending 15 minutes before it happened,black_comedy
whenever one of my friends comes over for a movie night i always desperately try to elbow this movie into our play list generally the consensus of this film is that it will be a boring british film i mean how could a british film be exciting with brendan gleeson and ralph fiennes set in a small belgian town what my friends soon realize is that this movie is completely off the wall it masterfully balances comedy violence and drama there are so many laugh out loud scenes that if i tried to describe all of them i would explain the entire film suffice to say by the end my throat was sore from laughing so god damned much the characters are amazingly well realized especially ralph fiennes who provides an amazing performance also people who say that colin farrel is a poor actor will retract those comments after seeing this film an absolutely peerless movie that has the best to offer from three genres that generally dont mix well my one complaint is that some scenes are not for the squeamish and a bit unnecessary if youve seen the film you will immediately know what im talking about,black_comedy
ken an ray two irish hit men are seen arriving belgium the have been told to go to that city after a job had gone badly back in ireland their boss harry figures the medieval city will be perfect to get this duo away from all the commotion the crime has caused back home ray doing his first job has to get rid of a priest in doing so he also kills an innocent child on his way to confession the mere idea in killing a minor is something so repugnant that even the criminal boss is horrifiedharry remembering fondly the time he visited that lovely old city decides to send the two men there ken who is older and wiser decides to take it easy and tries to discover the hidden treasures of bruges while ray a much younger and inexperienced man thinks the city stinks literally having them share a room is too much for ray ken on the other hand doesnt appreciate his babysitting job knowing his younger partner is a loose cannonray discovers the gorgeous chloe that appears to be working in a movie being shot in the city ray wants to have fun finding that chloe is game for whatever as they are getting comfortable at her place her boyfriend eirik arrives wielding a gun and pointing it to ray who is able to get it from him little did he know it had blank bullets in the struggle ray fires a shot wounding eirik in one eyeken receives an urgent message from harry he must eliminate ray ken is not mentally prepared to execute what harry wants from him in fact when he finds the proper time to do it he changes his mind ans asks ray to go away and try to stay away from ireland and england but as fate has it ray is found out by the police because of a violent encounter with a canadian tourist at a restaurantharry decides he cannot trust ken he shows up to take care of business the confrontation has harry and ken going to a tower that faces the main square what happens next will surprise us because of the way things develop the ending parallels what happened to ray when he killed the boy by accident in this instance harry proves he might be a criminal also but one with scruplesis a fine film by playwright turned director martin mcdonagh whose leenanne trilogy the liutenant of inishmore and other plays have delighted theater goers in the last decade decided to work on an original story that he magnificently sets in the gorgeous and touristy city of bruges belgium mr mcdonagh shows why he is one of the best writers working these days with this debut he makes probably the impossible task of making a film that everybody will use as a base of comparison against his future filmsthe cast is first rate brendan gleeson the star of his short film six shooter was born to play ken the older criminal that has seen a lot during his hard life in that world this actor clearly shows why he is one of the best character actors around equally surprising is colin farrell this actor brings an intensity to his ray the ambitious young man who made a mistake in misjudging the way he was to eliminate an enemy and has to pay dearly for it ralph fiennes gives one of the best performances of his career as the crime boss with a conscience his presence in the film is based on a raw energy we just didnt expectthe supporting cast is excellent clemence poesy is the beautiful chloe the woman that catches rays eye jeremie renier the wonderful belgian actor has a small part as the skinhead eirik thekla reuten appears as the pregnant hotel owner zeljko ivanek has a small but important part as the offended tourist that protest about smoking in a restaurant jordan prentice is jimmy the dwarf actor working in the film that is being shot and becomes friendly with raythe film is photographed lovingly by eigil bryld he takes us through the magical city of bruges to witness the action never making the mistake of making it a travelogue carter burwells fine musical score contributes to our enjoyment of the film credit must go to the director for bringing all the elements together in this amazing production,black_comedy
was a better than expected action crime thriller comedy because of the great performances by colin farrell and brendan gleeson as two hit men held up after a difficult job and raplh fiennes in a brief role as their angry boss writerdirector martin mcdonagh does an admirable job of bringing this movie to the big screen with just enough humor action and some suspense thats makes an enjoyable film the rest of supporting cast are good in their roles but its farrell gleeson and fiennes who stand out amongst them impressed me it was funny at times and violent with dark humor most of the screen time is given to the two leads farrell and gleeson who definitely make the best of it their scenes together are worth watching the film alone ralph fiennes does lack screen time because he doesnt show up until late into the movie but he does a decent enough job with his smart part i recommend anyone looking for a movie to watch thats different and entertaining at the same time most of that because of the terrific performances by farrell and gleeson if youre a fan of action crime thrillers with humor or anyone in the cast than is the movie for you,black_comedy
bruges is a fairytale its also in belgium we are repeatedly reminded of both these facts throughout the movie a dark comedy that isnt afraid to push the envelope on topics ranging from hit men and religion to midgets no dwarfs racism and tourist etiquette this movie is not for the queasy or the easily offended as the violence is grisly and the jokes dance in the glory that is unpolitically correctnesshowever dont get me wrong there is a lot that is easy to like about first the scenery is gorgeous and the picturesque quiet town serves as a delightful backdrop and foil to the story which is at times pleasantly crude after watching this movie many feel a strong desire to visit bruges and even i a tourist more like ray in taste than ken admit that there is a strange almost magical appeal to the town indeed often it truly does feel like a fairytale place especially when contrasted to the violence and pitchblack humor that fills much of the filmsecondly the cast is absolutely flawless as ray colin farrell brings an odd sort of charisma that immediately endears his character to the hearts of the viewers ray could easily have been overly rude and obnoxious but instead it is almost impossible not to like him and care about what happens to him in this movie colin farrell has perfect comedic timing and expressions that are alternately hilarious and touching and he proves that he can indeed act something which many  including me  have known for a long time and reminds the world why he reached alist status at the ripe age of 25 as ken rays perfect foil brendan gleeson brings a more subtle brilliance to the screen lending his character a sort of quiet dignity that is rare in hit men even those in the movies in addition to their pitchperfect performances what really makes the friendship between ray and ken work is the undeniable chemistry between the actors also it must be said that even though he appears in less than half of the movie ralph fiennes gives a memorable performance and is in turns hilarious and menacing the supporting cast is worth noting and especially jordan prentice and clemence posey does an excellent job of well supporting the main actorsthe next most noteworthy aspect of is the nearly flawless direction and writing by martin mcdonagh this is mcdonaghs first feature film he is most known for his theater work and for winning the oscar for the short film six shooter and it is a better debut than almost anyone could ask for there is barely a line of the dialogue that is unquotable and perhaps even more remarkable is the way mcdonagh seamlessly blends all the elements of the action comedy romance and drama work together in perfect balance giving the movie a unique and unforgettable feel also while it is undeniably hilarious it is the emotion that really makes stand out as well as the subtle message of redemption and friendship,black_comedy
one of the outstanding movies of 2008 is that rare cinematic high wire act that manages to juggle any number of seemingly contradictory moods and tones simultaneously without ever once dropping the ball alternating between the absurdly funny and the deadly serious the movie written and directed by martin mcdonagh offers a wise witty and surprisingly touching take on friendship guilt redemption and the strange code of ethics that guides the behavior of the professional killer those who appear in the movies at leastcolin farrell and brendan gleason are superb as ray and ken two british hit men who are sent to bruges belgium to hide out after ray accidentally kills a young boy in an assassination gone wrong stuck in this strange medieval city the two men make the best of a bad situation ken by taking in the sights and immersing himself in the rich history and culture of the place ray by moaning about how bored and homesick he is all the while trying to work through the guilt of having the blood of an innocent child on his handsin a screenplay crackling with irony and wit mcdonagh paints the portrait of an unusual friendship between two men who seemingly have little in common beyond their chosen profession and a mutual respect for one another ken is mature well educated eventempered and pragmatic while ray is unbright hotheaded and easily provoked by the words and actions of others yet somewhere beneath his roughandtumble sometimes rather befuddled exterior beats a giving heart and an appreciation for the good that can be found in certain people gleason and farrell give performances of immense sophistication and depth with farrell in particular creating a fully rounded portrait of a loveable killer his body compressed down into a perpetual slump while a host of conflicting emotions flutter across his expressive face farrell demonstrates that he has the physicality an actor needs to make a character come to life on screen in a much smaller role ralph fiennes also makes his mark as the mob boss who has some strange notions about what constitutes morality and honor when it comes to killingadd to all these various virtues lyrical direction by mcdonagh beautiful cinematography by eigil bryld some colorful minor characters and architecture guaranteed to knock the viewers eye out  and you have one of the true movie going pleasures of recent years,black_comedy
yeah is a film thats like a fairy tale first of all the acting is fascinating colin farrell shows with this film what his potential is brendan gleeson had impressed me too and ralph fiennes was like always i think that this film is a very well made dark comedy the development of the story is thrilling and you get no time bored the relationship between ray farrel and ken gleeson is illustrated excellent in the movie the characters are real and you can feel with them to create characters in movies isnt easy but this is one of the most important elements that make a film a film and this is made successful in this picture which lets hope more from martin mcdonagh as a film directorthe tension in the beginning of the film is very important it gives the viewer the chance to discover the two hit men but when you get to know that kens mission is to kill ray the real tension begins and at this point in an old town like bruges which is like a fairy tale the fairy tale begins i recommend this picture to everyone one of the big films of the last years youll be not bored and youll enjoy this piece of thrilling storytelling,black_comedy
if i had to describe in one word it would be  theater because thats how i felt after i saw itstory about two irish hit men brendan gleeson and colin farrell who were sent to hide by their boss ralph fiennes is dark comedy with brilliant screenplay dialogue is just fantastic its incredible how you can be pulled to screen watching dialogue about midget war or touristic attraction of bruges but dont be fooled  behind on first sight irrelevant conversations and witty dialogues lie existentialistic questions about life and death and everything between why theater well through this brilliant dialogue base of every good play as stage develops relationship between four main characters  nihilist ray collin farrell experienced ken brendan gleeson energetic harry ralph fiennes and bruges itself besides this there are great supporting characters  hotel owner marie thekla reuten midget jimmy jordan prentice rays girlfriend chloe clemence poesi and many others acting is excellent with actors fitting roles perfectly very nice surprise is collin farrell who has proved he can carry film as leading actorwith european touch of martin mcdonagh became one of the best films i saw this year if not the best what needs to be mentioned again is outstanding scriptso was the play good brillianti even think shakespeare would like it,black_comedy
when i was going to see this i didnt have the highest expectations but in bruiges surprised me it was a great movie and one of the best comedies of the year im not the biggest fan of colin farrell either but i have to say that he was fantastic in this movie his character is so convincing that i will probably always see him as ray from now on brendan gleeson made a great performance as well but fiennes could have been better i see his performance as rather flat the directing and cinematography was great they make bruiges seem so beautiful and exotic the writing is superb some scenes are really funny bu theres also a lot of suspense and great dialog overall in bruiges was a great movie it surprised me especially farrell and i recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good time,black_comedy
a few of months back when my uncle returned home from one of his many business trips a dvd copy of returned with him being a fool i ended up judging the film by its cover and deciding not to dedicate precious time to viewing it a combination of incidents including the christmas holidays and having nothing better to do resulted in me giving the shithole of bruges a trywhat i found is quite hard to describe comedy perhaps i hope im not too rude to say that this film was too good to be categorized as a comedy drama that might be it but then againno anyways the film takes place where the  is bruges its in belgium two hitman are sent there after completing a mission and are being asked to wait for further instructionsbeautiful beautiful cinematography of christmas time in a small town known mostly for its well preserved medieval and gothic character a most captivating original soundtrack composed by carter burwell brilliant script writing including a great great dialogue as well as a impressive direction debut both by martin mcdonagh adding to that a cast led by colin farrell brendan gleeson and ralph fiennes along with magnificent smaller roles by more unpopular faces portraying a dwarf a female lover a russian gun supplier an historical tower manager and a local policeman and there you have your mustseeill end by referring to what turned this film from just being good to being great to me at least and this is the ending in my eyes the ending is a homage or perhaps a pastiche to a painting of hell and judgment day we are acquainted with in a museum along the film this ending these images they will stay with you well after the credits are gone it takes a little something for a film to make me watch it twice has this little somethingenjoy,black_comedy
colin farrel and brendan gleeson work perfectly together as characters with opposing minds the performance of colin farrel reminds me of his great and under appreciated work in phonebooth the beginning may appear slow to many but it is the cause for it becoming popular upon others the constant and offensive dialogue by farrel will cause many laughs and spark the interest of any movie lover gleesons role further enhances everything that farrel does in the film ralph fiennes plays his role perfectly and is compatible with the other charactersa person choosing to watch this film will be delightfully surprised and enjoy every second the cast mends together fantastically and there is not a single character that doesnt cause an eyebrow to be raised the storyline itself is incredible and will make any person glued to their seat ready to see what is coming next the film has seen some critical praise but the general public does not seem to know about this movie it is time for anyone who has not seen to take a good look,black_comedy
this is the first feature film of director martin mcdonagh his previous foray into film was the short six shooter which come to think of it would be an ideal addition when is released on dvd is a superior english gangster film similar but not an echo of those two other great english gangster films the long good friday and sexy beast indeed the harry waters character played with venomous realism by ralph fiennes is strikingly similar to the don logan character played with even more toxicity by ben kingsley in sexy beast but there is where any resemblance ends whereas the the long good friday was about power and how easily it can slip through ones fingers and sexy beast was about a retired criminal being persuaded to carry out one last job is about the aftermath of a hit ray and ken farrell and gleeson respectively play two hit men the film opens with postcard scenes of the old city of bruges in belgium while a voice over explains why these two men find themselves in this ancient city ken is the more pragmatic of the two he is quite content to do a spot of sightseeingwhile awaiting further instructions ray on the other hand thinks bruges is a dump ray just wants to get back to the city he was born in dublin but as the film progresses its gradually revealed why both men have to hang around till they receive these further instructions when the instructions finally comes is not what we expect both brendan gleeson and colin farrell are terrific especially farrell as ray the supporting cast is equally good  jordan prentice as jimmy zeljko ivanek as the canadian and eric godon as yuri there were a few instances in the film i found somewhat confusing  but to list them would be both superfluous unnecessary and would spoil other film goers enjoyment is a rollicking yarn expertly crafted with great dialogue and many an unexpected plot twist i recommend it unreservedly,black_comedy
the film that made me make an account in imdb dark comedy at its best having regard to the soundtrack you start off with a depressive toneand it never actually stops also with the characters constantly whining about their current location the film never seems to make you feel comfortable but the film touches us all through having those little everyday awkward situations the film is depressing but it will make you laughand in the end you will feel like you just witnessed one really great movie even tho you still have to shake off the depression that little seed of joy will end up blossoming some time later ,black_comedy
a really fantastic and darkly comic film the entire cast is superb which is especially fortunate in this case as they really do guide this story through to an unpredictable and brilliant ending ken and ray are two hit men sent to bruges its in belgium you know to hide out after a contract ray carried out went bad it is difficult to adequately summarise the plot without giving too much away so i wont bother but guns humor emotion and a great set of characters give rise to an excellent film ralph fiennes  harry  a cockney crime lord  evidently operating in dublin brendon gleeson  ken  an aging hitman colin farrell  ray  a youthful hitman with a some pretty serious problems910,black_comedy
some films you can watch over and over again but just because you wouldnt watch a film twice doesnt mean its rubbish this is the case withfor a film that uses the word fck and its derivatives 126 times thats an average of 118 fcks per minute you really wouldnt notice as they are lost in the fantastic dialogueis a wonderfully crafted film in all respects martin mcdonagh wrote and directed the film and brings out the best in the two irish leads colin farrell as ray and brendan gleeson as ken ken and ray are two hit men sent to bruge by their boss play by ralph fiennes after a job goes wrong all of which are amusingly characterised and portrayed realisticallythe film oozes atmosphere and i wouldnt want to spoil the story but it is both touching and funny as with any kind of successful dark comedy there is an array of quirky characters including a dwarf a oneeyed boyfriend pregnant hotel lady gun seller and a drug trafficker all the actors performances are a joy and overall it is a piece of excellent executed movie making with some great momentsid recommend this film to anyone that wants to see something original,black_comedy
i had interest in seeing because of all the great commentaries i had heard about itand the film did not disappoint meis a brilliant movie with many positive elementsthe best element from this movie is the screenplayit shows intelligence on a lot of occasions and it has a lot of excellent dialogsbut the best element of it is the characters it hasin spite of the main characters being killersthe spectator finishes empathizing with themthe performances also help to this moviecolin farrell and brendan gleeson bring great performancesthese two actors make their characters memorable and thats not easy to getso they both made a great achievement which will sadly be ignored by the awardsdirector martin mcdonagh made an impressing first film and it will be very interesting to watch his next projectsthe only fail i found on this movie was thaton a specific momentit was a bit slowbutin spite of thatis a brilliant movie which i recommend with a lot of enthusiasm because i liked it very much,black_comedy
my god all the recent movies that i had pretty low expectations for turned out to be great unexpectedly before this one it was keith this movie is simply freakingincredible i mean it dont make you wow like the way we react watching movies with super effects but this movie has crazy twists the award most original film is a perfect one for bruges a fine blend of drama and comedy never watched anything like this the movie also has a lot of irony that make you burst into laughter even when the actors are being seriousi like the father figure of ken who look chubby nice and really care about ray cant believe hes a hitman i like chloe shes pretty rays a nice guy too tho sometimes hes rude therefore i dont like the ending where everyone i like died but what can we do its a dramahighly recommended,black_comedy
i like to think of movies like as genuine gems when i say movies like i necessarily think of films with similar subject matter i tend to think of those kind of films which justappear out of nowhere you hear about a movie the promotional material looks rather impressive the film looks like it belongs to a genre youre interested in you allow yourself a glimpse of the basic plot no more lest the experience is spoilt and it sounds like something that in the right hands could be inflated into a compelling piece of cinema is a tick in each of those boxes as of writing id definitely consider it one of the best films ive seen all year if not the best outrightwhat makes you say that you may ask i guess the simple answer is this  everything yes i know very simple  but everything in this movie just falls right into place and the result is a finely polished caper flick if i had to pinpoint the films strongest individual part id say it was the script writerdirector mcdonagh is also a renowned playwright and the same quality translates to the films story has a very playlike feel to it largely due to its heavy reliance on character development as the two leads gleeson and farrell are nothing short of brilliant they are capable of taking several different duo clichs and twisting them into something that feels surprisingly fresh and even when theyre not paired together they maintain strong presences onscreen gleeson is perfect as the amiable ken but farrell truly shines as ray who balances cockiness with insecurity deftly even though i havent seen much of farrells other work i honestly think he turned in a potential careerbest act herethe supporting cast is also treated very well even the smallest supporting characters are a source of great comedy or great drama whatever may be needed whenever they reappear in the story it never feels forced but fits in perfectly out of all of them jordan prentice steals the show as an embittered american dwarf whos to make an arthouse film the only real weakness i could find with the cast was clmence posy as drugdealerlove interest chle who isnt necessarily bad but isnt really given anything spectacular to work withthe film rolls along at a great pace there is the very occasional scene that doesnt feel like it goes anywhere but the rest of it manages to be great the balance between comedy largely as a result of rays nonetoopleasant altercations with locals and nonlocals alike and drama is excellent the film has countless laughoutloud moments yet it also has some genuinely shocking twists in it it manages to remain compelling all throughout its running time another aspect i feel really gives the film a distinct feel is the location of bruges itself youve got to love those films where the location virtually becomes a character in the story and bruges memorably described by ralph fienness harry as a beautiful fing fairy tale town certainly comes into its own as such a character the locales are brilliant none so much as the bell tower which is easily the most memorable building featured in the filmto conclude i loved plain and simple its a hundredodd minutes worth of entertainment both comedic and tragic what few flaws this film has are made up for by its many strengths it may be a little strong in the violencelanguage department but if that doesnt bother you you should enjoy this easily one of the best films ive watched in a while,black_comedy
absolutely funny a very good funny dark comedy settled a small beautiful town in belgium at the end of the movie you have the desire of visiting that fairytale place i really enjoyed the movie and i recommend to anyone the main character is absolutely hilarious with his charming irish accent and a lot of gags its an antiamerican movie but very funny if you are american you need to be autoironic to like the movie but if youre you would spend almost 2 hours laughing the story is absolutely original and the characters develop it brilliantly and you will remember the last pearl of wisdom about spending a life,black_comedy
a new contract killer ray colin farrell and his older wiser partner ken brendan gleeson are sent to hide out by their boss harry ralph fiennes after an unexpected accident from a job goes wrong which ray is very unhappy with the situation being sent to a city he doesnt quite know although his partner is happy being in the city especially for sight seeing and learning the history of bruges ray meets chloe clmence posy in a movie set which he completely finds himself attractive to her since chloe is a drug dealer for a living both men find some happiness in the city while being stuck there which they have to wait for harrys call in the hotel although ray is battling with depression after his first hitwritten and directed by martin mcdonagh made an fresh intriguing darkly funny comedy that has hints of drama and sadness as well mcdonaghs premise could have been really clich theres plenty of movies about hitmans also his movie doesnt try to be cool as well which its quite unique farrell is excellent in the picture i havent seen him this good in a movie although his dialogue are hard to understand at times since he has a thick irish accent gleeson is terrific as well posy is certainly a great talent to watch for since shes very beautiful as well fiennes is a hoot as the vulgar boss which his dialogue are hilarious jordan prentice is also good as the racist druguser dwarf actordvd has an sharp anamorphic widescreen 2351 transfer and an good dolby digital 51 surround sound i would have love to get an running commentary track by the filmmaker or even from the cast members but sadly we didnt get it the dvd features are good which it includesdeletedextended scenes bloopers and featurettes this is one of the few movies i been really impressive with from this year releases it was certainly much better than i hoped for and it manages to be quite touching at times for sure is going to be one of my ten 10 movies of 2008 this feature is not to be missed super 35  ,black_comedy
i expected a british comedy which i love and got it but i also got a movie that has that single indescribable quality that so few films have i rank this one right up there with films like fight club lost in translation and no country for old men which i hold in high regard on a final note does any1 else think that bredan gleeson should get an oscar nomination for best supporting actor i do i was very impressed with his acting in this move i felt that it was much better than it was in gangs of new york and way better than in the fifth harry potter film id like some other opinions on this so let me knowaside from the acting i also enjoyed what i saw as an increase in realism when compared to other american films not realism in the sense that i thought the character ken should have survived that amount of blood loss and a fall of somewhere around twelve stories  let alone be able to mutter words and have them make sense but the realism in that they did not curb anything for sake of getting a lower age rating they said what they wanted too and used an uncommon amount of blood when compared to many other films especially the last time ken is shot and when he hits the pavement from the tower lastly did any1 else think that the costumes and scenery for the movie that was being filmed at the end was supposed to be a reference back to the painting that ray and ken discussed in the museum let me know your thought on the matter,black_comedy
you see the previews and wonder if its a piece of crap or something cool guess what  the latter very interesting dynamics among the characters even harry fienes as the crime overlord quite funny in spots quite tragic in others a whole set of peculiar minor characters including the midget the wonderful old world scenery of a medieval city where anyone can go sightsee the old buildings up the twisty narrow staircases unless youre a pack of elephants you certainly might laugh at times at others you might almost crya real fine mix of everything you want to see in a crime movie and its set,black_comedy
came out of absolutely nowhere and put our faith back into the british gangster flick with its fast paced script amazing acting talents and sheer wittinesscolin farrell is slightly underrated in his acting talents but mainly due to the fact his acting cv consists of roles in slightly terrible films daredevil for one but to deny this man his praise for his portrayal of ray in this film would be nothing short of a disgrace holed up in a the shitty little town of bruges after a hit goes wrong you can see that the character of ray is too large for such a small town brendan gleeson brings us one of the best characters ive seen him play in a long time as ken the professional hitman acting more along the lines of a father figure to ray is one of the freshest pieces of british cinema ive witnessed since sexy beast and we all know the two main reasons that film was fantastic but in this the angry english hitmangangster type role is left to the ever great ralph fiennes playing harry whos psychotic and ruthless persona sets up for a fantastic villain kudos to farrell gleeson and fiennes for bringing us such an a brilliant piece of film and to the director for making one of the best british flicks of 2008,black_comedy
bruges the most wellpreserved medieval city in the whole of belgium is a welcoming destination for travelers from all over the world but for hit men ray colin farrell and ken brendan gleeson it could be their final destination a difficult job has resulted in the pair being ordered right before christmas by their london boss harry ralph fiennes to go and cool their heels in the storybook flemish city for a couple of weeksvery much out of place amidst the gothic architecture canals and cobbled streets the two hit men fill their days living the lives of tourists ray still haunted by the bloodshed in london hates the place while ken even as he keeps a fatherly eye on rays often profanely funny exploits finds his mind and soul being expanded by the beauty and serenity of the citybut the longer they stay waiting for harrys call the more surreal their experience becomes as they find themselves in weird encounters with locals tourists violent medieval art a dwarf american actor jordan prentice shooting a european art film dutch prostitutes and a potential romance for ray in the form of chloe clemence poesy who may have some dark secrets of her own and when the call from harry does finally come ken and rays vacation becomes a lifeanddeath struggle of darkly comic proportions and surprisingly emotional consequences 910,black_comedy
sorry the language but this is by far the best hitman movie i have ever seen it has the best dialogs ive seen in years and collin farrel bravo youve just gotten in my book as an actor fresh jokes hilarious and it also has serious parts the music is well orchestrated and fits the movie well you really get a feeling how bruge is as a small town with personality but the thing that makes this movie is the characters the 2 main hit men and the way they interact with each other is so believable although very strange you should definitely see this at the cinemaa must see,black_comedy
this must be my first time ever writing a review for any movie on imdb i often refer to the reviews on imdb but never quite felt the need to comment on the movies i have watched it seems is not very well known but it is definitely the best movie i have seen in a whilei was told that it was a witty movie about two hit men and thats about all i really knew about the movie itself id never seen the trailer or anything i must admit that bruges is a beautiful place and the cinematography excellently brought out the finer points of the little town id have to say that it was slow in the beginning and left me in a state of curiosity but things all worked themselves into place eventually and the movie itself was more emotional than i had expected i loved the irish humour and it was a good balance for the emotional strings that the movie managed to pullive told everyone ive talked to that they should watch this movie its simply that good,black_comedy
somehow ken i believe that the balance shall tip in the favor of culture like a big fat fcking retarded fcking black girl on a seesaw if theres a line that perfectly sums up its the aboveoffensive emotional hilarious and brilliant would also be good individual wordsthis film is by far one of the best this yearfor me it ranked up and around no country for old menplease god let martin mcdonagh make more movies preferabley with brendan gleeson againfor those who worry about colin farrells comic timing worry nothes spot on complimenting the immense gleeson and fiennes brilliantlyfiennes is clearly in his element playing against type as a hard as nails cocky gangster who could be in the nest guy ritchie moviethe films strength is in its ability to have you laughing one minute and crying the nextmartin mcdonagh knows how to write we all know thaton the path from stage to screen he has used his unique manipulation of the english language to prove his worth time and time againas well as being an accomplished writer hes also a bloody academy award winner i saw this the day it was released in ireland in a less than half full screen in the middle of the day and everyone of us was laughing away together in a shared experience of what will no doubt be a classic irish rollercoaster ride of a filmchrist i even wanted to go to bruges by the end of it,black_comedy
i saw this movie on a whim i had heard good things about it from friends and the reviews seemed positive enough but i wasnt necessarily chomping at the bit to see it i wasnt terribly impressed with martin mcdonoughs oscarwinning short film revolver but based on the buzz i figured was worth a look i was very mistaken in my assumptions this is an absolutely fantastic movie colin farrell and brendan gleeson are both phenomenal and ralph fiennes though he only appears halfway through the film is perfect as a hardedged crime boss with a short fuse colin farrell tends to catch a lot of guff for his performances but i have always found him to be a very talented actor he may not always choose the best roles but in everything that ive seen him in he has engaged me as a viewer here his work is superb he nails everything about the character of ray and is utterly believable as a hitman wrestling with his demons clemence poesy is good as well and obviously very beautiful and enigmatic though her character wasnt as fully fleshed out as i would have liked bruges makes a gorgeous backdrop for the action of the film and having recently returned from belgium myself not bruges however though now i wish id gone there the charm of the country and the overwhelming sense of history is captured perfectly the fairytale town is not only beautiful but its atmosphere and the palpable sense of medieval ideals are essential to the central ideas of the story and what a story it is in my opinion the script is the strength of this film thematically emotionally and narratively this script is firing on all cylinders mcdonough does a fantastic job of connecting the characters not only through their actions but through the dramatic tension inherent in maintaining proximity with people whom you may not really like the relationship that evolves between ray and ken is brilliant and the secondary characters fill in the gaps admirably the sense of sacrifice and redemption is handled very well and at no point do the actions taken by the characters feel forced or unrealistic nor do their interactions with one another feel overly expository everything is very evenhanded and mcdonough has crafted one hell of a wellbalanced the trailers lead one to believe that this is a sort of noircomedy it is in a sense and there are many funny parts but there are some very serious themes presented here hell guilt redemption and sacrifice are the themes that drive the story and martin mcdounoughs ability to inject humor into very serious subject matter is part of what makes this film so successful overall a great movie and an exceptionally original piece of filmmaking,black_comedy
in an era when script tends to play a poor second fiddle to visuals this fine story restores your faith in storytelling writer and producer martin mcdonagh already has a distinguished pedigree as a playwright the lieutenant of inishmore being perhaps his finest work to date when some playwrights bring their craft to the big screen they fail to grasp the possibilities that a space beyond a stage offers them with mcdonagh he brings the best of the intensity of the stage to the screenthe storyline is simple two hit men flee london after a job to bruges and await instructionsplayed by colin farrell and brendan gleeson the first hour is an absolute joythey talk they reflect they discuss in a manner very reminiscent of travolta and jackson in pulp fictionintermittently very violent the film oozes restraint making the bloody outbursts even more shockinga perverse gunmans morality also underpins everything which passesralph fiennes has great fun as godfather harry in a role which acknowledges that played by ben kingsley in sexy beastas is the hallmark of most playwrights the story has a proper end and is all the more satisfying for itwith tarrantino and ritchie seemingly spent forces at the moment the field is open for the likes of mcdonagh and the coen brothers to blaze a trail for 21st century crime capersat just over an hour and a half the film also displays a rare discipline as the viewer quickly learns to soak in each setting and each exchange of badinage  so little is wastedas of early may my favourite film of 2008,black_comedy
over a blank screen an irish accent starts a monologue that ends with a brilliant opening joke and i realise that im going to like this film like a violent and very adult episode of father ted the two main characters ray farrell and ken gleeson are hit men relocated to the sleepy belgium town of bruges after a job in england goes wrong the pair are constantly at odds and like any great comedy duo play off each other amazingly well the dialogue is fast and funny and the only let up is to make way for action or at times poignancy the films charm lies in the fact that you can never quite tell what it wants to be just when you think its a sharp script based comedy like kiss kiss bang bang it changes direction to become a tense thriller via moments that wouldnt seem out of place in a farley brothers gross out movie as well as an impressive use of swearing and some totally unpc insults there are effects that would make even the strongest stomached patron wince a little but as part of the whole package including a great little part from fiennes as big boss harry this is one of the most enjoyable cinema going experiences ive had all year a hidden gem with all the elements that other films lack humour excitement a storyline and characterisation it is also blessed with an overwhelming sense of not being afraid to play out for an adult audience brilliant,black_comedy
theyre all here the big issues i refer not to some huge pile of copies of the shabby magazine the uk homeless use to fund their narcotic predilections but to the weighty literary themes death love honour friendship sacrifice and possibly redemptionall this wrapped in a shroud of the darkest black humour and topped with a comedy bad guy comedy baddest guy actually because all the main speaking parts in this movie except for one are bad guys when measured by the traditional moral yardstick we have hit men drug dealers petty thieves prostitutes and casual racist midgets all in the undeniably picturesque setting of bruges its in belgiumcolin farrell who i had previously thought to have the killer combination of good looks and bad acting delivers an excellent comedic performance with impeccable timing but it is brendan gleeson as his friend and partner in crime who steals the show ralph fiennes steps out of typecast to deliver a chillingly surreal yet downtoearth cockerney gangster in a will self plays bill sykes mannerother comments and the forums ask how did it end and for me it ends like it ends  what you choose to believe happens next is up to you but it doesnt feel unresolved,black_comedy
where have all the black comedies gone well we just found one of them and its really good if youd seen the trailer you might well be expecting something entirely different perhaps a bit of a comedy farce but please dont be put off wonderful characterisation fantastic performances real surprises sublime dialogue funny and beautifully tragic what else can you ask for colin farrell is absolutely superb bringing life to a character at a level that is surely beyond the call of a man who has made it in hollywood to compliment farrell without acknowledging the other main characters is to sell them short so brendan gleeson the rather beautiful clmence posy and ralph fiennes heres to you please go and see it because we need more films like this,black_comedy
i have to agree with most of the main points in the positive reviews of this film the script is great brendan gleason colin farrell ralph feinnes and the flemish actors are excellent and the setting is used well the burghers of bruges can expect a spike in the numbers of large overweight englishspeaking american tourists thanks to this film but the thumbsdown reviewers also make good points colin farrell mugs a lot the arc of the story is predictable once the boss fiennes places his call to ken gleason the climax at the tower is hard to believe the bulletriddled ending is equally hard to believe and reminiscent of the ending of the departed equally unconvincing the film is full of quotes and paraphrases from past films a medieval square altstaat at night comes straight out of the third man one character deliberately shoots another in the thigh reminiscent of brendan gleasons signature work the general the final scene is a paraphrase of the final scene of the coen brothers blood simpletheres a point that jumped out at me that hasnt been raised yetthere are two or three gags at the expense of americans in the film that wouldnt really be objectionable but for the fact that some of the gags are conflated with racism i cant object to jokes at our expense  i am an american since theres a germ of truth in every one of them the racism however is gratuitous we dont need this movie to tell us its a problem speakingagain as an american racisminamerica cropped up enough times in this film to draw my attention away from the story itself after the first two or three mentions i was sitting there waiting for the next antiamerican racist gagso on the whole i scored the film 9 for production values and 4 forwhat rudeness resulting in a 7 star rating,black_comedy
this black comedy is not for the faint of heart it is at times very violent also there is drug use and sex between unmarried adultsi believe there is a misconception about some reviews ive seen of this movie this isnt a movie about two hit men the character played by colin farrell is only an attemptedhitman my feeling was he was playing a person who did have a violent past but he was not a psychopath like any professional hitman would have to be he likely thought that as a hitman he would only be killing bad people but his first hit goes terribly wrong and this movie is about the guilt he feels from that if youve ever made a mistake in your life with terrible consequences youll be able to relate to his character farrell does a great job in this movie and nobody does brooding like he canthere is tremendous drama in the movie but it is still a comedy most of the comedy comes from farrell but ray fienes is also hilarious as the boss who is a psychopathanother movie out this year dealing with hit men is no country for old men personally i think this movie is better,black_comedy
reading through some of the other reviews for i began to wonder if i had seen a different filmthe one my wife and i saw  on dvd  had a great story but a story that was destroyed by overwordy heavyhanded and unfunny dialogue and a director who seemed unsure of what he wanted the film to be was it supposed to be farce perhaps a gentle comedy maybe a thriller with comedy overtones perhaps a black comedy who knows at times we felt we were watching an episode of the british tv sitcom father ted but without the funas i have already stated it was a great story but it needed two primary changes a scripteditor with a ruthless approach to dialogue and a director with a true sense of what the film should have beenfinally a thought imagine what a wondrous film this would have been with the coen brothers at the helm,black_comedy
i was anxious to see and of course that put me in the wrong mind set except for the icy photography here and there watching the film has been a waste of timethe dialogue sound was awful  may be not to the irish ear but hey we cant all be irish the music was okone remarkable detail is that no vehicle is seen during the whole film except for boats which made bruges rather look like venice this sensation was heightened by the heronimus bosch style outfits in the endno use crying over spilled milk suffices to say that is like a guy ritchie film gone bad not my cupatea,black_comedy
for his first feature film pronounced broozh irish playwright martin mcdonagh the pillowman has fashioned an absurdist black comedy about hit men hiding out in the medieval city of bruges belgium taking stock of their life while awaiting their next assignment the film offers fabulous acting by a stellar cast glorious scenery worthy of the best travelogue and the characters poignant metaphoric journey from cave to cathedral yet the story line about thoughtful hit men and the mobsters code of honor is artificial and selfconscious and contains some insensitive humor that comes off as more of an ill show you if you think i am politically correct exercise than something intrinsic to the characterscolin farrell plays ray an english hit man who botched his first assignment and has been exiled to bruges by his london handler harry ralph fiennes together with rays partner ken brendan gleeson the absurdity of having two mobsters trying to come to terms with a city full of culture and history is quite funny and engenders some feeling about being a stranger in a strange land the culture unfortunately is lost on ray he calls bruges a beep hole and humors ken who is interested in seeing the sights and attractions of the old city in the process mcdonagh goes out of his way to be offensive to everyone including gays dwarfs blacks and women and also dumps on americans a safe target showing an overweight couple taken aback when ray suggests that they would have trouble maneuvering the winding stairs to the top of a monumenthe paints bruges as a city with russian gunrunners and chloe clemence poesy an attractive drug dealer selling drugs to a racist dwarf jordan prentice while an art movie is being filmed but this has more to do with the demands of the script than the reality of bruges mcdonaghs idea of humor seems to be his characters putting down the world around them ray calls the timeless art works rubbish by spastics and says he would be impressed with bruges if he had grown up on a farm and was retarded do you think this is good he asks ken going round in a boat looking at stuff neither have any idea why they are there i guess if its tuesday this must be belgiumwe soon find out that ray is racked with guilt because he accidentally killed a fiveyear old boy who was in the line of fire as he was murdering a priest naturally he has no remorse for killing the priest because that is his chosen profession and he was only doing his job the hardball hit men turn softies right before our eyes as they ruminate about guilt sin and the hereafter and question what they have done and whether it means they are going to hell ray says aside from trying to live a good life i have to reconcile myself to the fact that i have killed people fine time to think of that while they do not exactly engage our sympathies the relationship between the two men is touching and they deserve credit for being willing to reexamine the choices they made in their lifeone is forced to wonder about these choices even more when ken turns up as an advocate of ghandian nonviolence after harry emerges from london to act out his sociopathic principles what remains after the soul searching is a bit of a romance some cool tarantinolike hip dialogue some obligatory chase scenes and a contrived plot sequence involving a murderous exboy friend of chloe who is blinded in one eye when ray shoots him with a blank in selfdefense at the bottom of this is the gangsters code of honor that we are supposed to admire but never seems to be a part of anything real yet in spite of its infuriating flaws is always entertaining and at times moving and does make me want to visit this entrancing city now that the lowlifes have been dispersed in true shakespearean style,black_comedy
while it has its charmsmost notably gleesons ken and his love of medieval architecturemostly stumbles under the weight of trying too hard to appear witty and quirky the dialogue although delivered sincerely enough by farrell gleeson and especially fiennes seems forced and i could not stop myself from realizing that i was listening to a script likewise the screenwriter mcdonagh who also directed is under the delusion that dropping the fbomb often will take care of things such as making the dialogue hip and funnythere are throwaway moments of true charm here though harry fienness love of fairytale bruges the random robert powell comparison a completely unbelievable yet somewhat refreshing shootout where a normally victimized female stockcharacter a proprietress refuses to budge from her place between the shooters and above and beyond all the true sense of brotherly concern ken gleeson has for ray farrell but once it gets caught up in the unfunny alcoves and racist dwarfs and a female character desperate to be shocking yet merely sweet and pretty and ultimately useless the picture sinksin time mcdonagh may write a better script one that does not feel like a students first attempt to impress his professor and us,black_comedy
prior to seeing martin mcdonaghs i had heard that it was a straightforward comedy it turned out that while the movie starts out comedic it gets more serious as it progresses colin farrell and brendan gleeson play hit men ray and ken respectively after ray accidentally kills a boy head honcho harry ralph fiennes sends ray and ken to bruges belgium this is the sort of city that by rights should attract just about every tourist certainly ken spends as much time as possible sightseeing ray however cant get over his previous actions and his short temper gets him into trouble everywheretwo wrenches get thrown into the works when ray strikes up a relationship with local drug dealer chloe clemence poesy and harry orders ken to kill ray the events resulting from the second part really set the movie on its more serious coursei guess that the movie disappointed me a little in that it turned out not to be the comedy that i expected but for the most part i liked how it posed the question of what is right in such a convoluted situation and lets the audience decide for themselves sort of like what no country for old men does worth seeing if not the best movie and if i may say so jimmys jordan prentice description of the race war sounded like what charles manson envisionedalso starring elizabeth berrington anna madeley thekla reuten ciaran hinds rudy blomme mark donovan ann elsley and jeanmarc favorin,black_comedy
saw this with nolow expectations but came away pleasantly surprisedthis is a well written story with interesting characters and fine acting that captivates and entertains the actors provide solid performancesand they complement each other very well the film has an interesting plot that becomes more complex as the story unfoldsthe action moves along at a good pacethe location is beautifully filmedthis is what a good film should be like and its enjoyable to see,black_comedy
there is a pleasant surprise to entering a movie theater with zero expectations having not seen the trailer or read any reviewsa dark dramatic comedy i enjoyed the camaraderie between colin farrell brendan gleeson and ralph fiennes each actor playing off the other clmence posy someone id never heard of put in a surprising performance playing farrells love interestkudos to the filmmakers for shooting which is the silent costar here with its centuriesold architecture historical significance and homey atmosphere id like to visit this city the next time i make my way to europe,black_comedy
full of good humour smart dialogue and interesting characters  plot,black_comedy
this was an enexpected film in an unexpected location its got all the stuff of a classic and someday will be,black_comedy
i watched this one night as nothing else was on at that point was not really a big fan of colin farrell so was not particularly looking forward to it i was so wrong its one of my favourite films of all time and watch it every christmas its so funny i just loved it brendan gleason is a legend,black_comedy
this movie is enjoyable if you want to clear your mind a bit nothing difficult no wit just a slow movie with thugs guns girls and drugsas a belgian however i visited bruges multiple times the spirit of bruges is not as shown here the cinematography makes it a desolate medieval city maybe it is for the characters allthough in real life it is a poetical place cultural warm and civilised not as cold as shown here even in winter for that 610 because it is ok i have seen worse but it certainly isnt a high profile film,black_comedy
i watched this movie few years back and i watched it again now in 2017 i still enjoyed even more than last time the soundtracks in this movie are amazing clean action simple  the most important thing is the natural beauty in this movie a good suspense plot little action and a good drama i recommend you watch it,black_comedy
a good film with lost of black humour in french called a film noir like the title says it all happens lots of twists to throw you off track sometimes a little slow for my liking i voted only 7 because of this but it keeps you entertained with a surprising end  colin farrell brendan gleeson make 2 perfect hoods an amazing performance of 2 small time players english whilst there crimes are big time hope this is not a spoiler a scene of this film is used in the amazing clip of nouelas sound of silence it is a film of rare quality directed by the writer of the script martin mcdonagh who made a great performance and captured the ambiance perfectly,black_comedy
i am obsessed with this film and have watched it approximately 25 times since i discovered it 3 weeks ago the acting is endearing the score haunting the story line graphic the plot is an allegory of the christian idea of god being too morally exact to love us and our eventual redemption through sacrifice while i dont buy into it i do find this theology fascinating and the characters are each of them completely redeemableyes there are a few small things i could pick apart if i wanted to be that person but why this film is delightful and i cherish it its also a travel advertisement for bruges which is now on my list,black_comedy
reviewed july 2011it deals on a very serious and sad story to be called a comedy but its consistence in humor is way too dense than your regular fun movie it does not pack any laugh out loud kind of jokes but the one that leaves a smile on you with its subtlety and darkness and a nod of appreciation for its wit a hit goes bad as a kid gets killed by accident and the two guys ray colin farrell and ken brendan gleeson responsible for it are asked to go to bruges belgium to get away from the heat takes a little while to get used to colin farrells histrionics as it starts and it gets better as it goes gleeson does full justice to a terrific role bruges the town itself is a character and justifies the title of the movie last and not the least clmence posy has the best smile going around and she is mostly used as a pretty doll it packs sharp and dark satirical dialogue that is full of wit and fun and there are many sequences which makes full use of it be it the ones involving the midget or how they go on in the climax about honor though there is nothing to enlighten you here which one shouldnt be expecting out of any movie it is a thoroughly enjoyable film with fantastic writing and performances,black_comedy
has been and i think will stay for a while the most interesting combination of cinematic gold ive seen in its genre the story line dialogue acting scene progression cinematography its all great what captured my interest the most though and really the ultimate reason why ive been able to rewatch this film over and over the years is thanks to a uniquely captured interplay found inside the story a propelling force created by and between the films lovable antihero character creations i saw something thats hard to describe its really something i think you can just feel as your laugh continuously catches you off guard throughout theres a lot of great humor in honesty and i think the actors captured the essence intended by the writing they nailed it it almost feels like improvisation it reaches an organic level bordering on legendarytheyve captured something here the unexpected candidacy resulted in comedy that caught me off guard in all the right ways the assassin with a conscience an empathetic chord striking and interest attracting element that will hook you in and keep you coming back for more the writing i found here is the benchmark renting then leasing now owning space in the back of my mind there i think it will remain as a constant personal aspiration of my own ever even coming close to writing like this as an end result much less post production would be something i could really consider a true accomplishment a great dark comedy great if not the greatest one of my favorite movies of all time based upon shear creativity do i think its under rated not if your from an audience that watches housewives of atlanta or honey boo boo not if you you are addicted to the opposite of laughterand enjoyment not if youre a toddler probably thats fair not if you are a potato its awesome crushed it,black_comedy
i will kick of the review by quoting another reviewer a bad review to illustrate that some people simply do not know what they are talking about one thing i am really sick of in englishlanguage movies not only this one is all these continental european supporting characters with absolutely flawless english in this case colin farrells enormously annoying belgian love interest not only do they never make any mistakes they speak the language so brilliantly that they can hold their own in witty conversations with native speakers firing from a sparkling repartee that includes puns on english words that i assume wouldnt work in their own language how about making a movie for a change in which belgians germans italians etc speak english the way they really do ie badly of course no explanation is ever given why they speak english so well usually one of the nativespeaker characters just makes a stupid surprised face and says something like wow your english is really good and thats that on to the next pun in europe they often do speak flawless english often better than the british this film is simply wonderful on so many levels great script brilliant acting colin farrell deserves every accolade for his role i would encourage anyone to watch this wonderful film,black_comedy
when you think of a dark comedy you generally associate it with dark humor however in the case of it is the story and themes that are dark with the humor used as levity unlike others which use it simply to get a laugh out of their film the comedy in serves a purposein terms of acting this movie is topnotch with all actors at the top of their game namely colin farrell as ray brandon gleeson as ken and ralph fiennes as harry every actor absolutely nails their roles and give truly convincing performances on top of that every character is multilayered and interesting in their own unique way ray couldve just been a mentally unstable whiny guy who didnt want to be but he was also a guiltridden suicide case who doesnt know if life is truly worth living anymore ken couldve been just another old mentor figure but he was also a conflicted man being forced to decide between what is right and wrong harry couldve been just an easily enraged menacing villain but he was also an incredibly honordriven man and a clearly loving father to a certain extent even the side characters all add their own unique likability to the film huge props to this film for knowing how to create truly interesting and likable charactersnow that thats out of the way lets get to what truly makes this film great the themes explored in the dialogue despite technically being a comedy like the truman show this film is so much more than just something to laugh at themes explored include guilt depression suicide death morality and even the meaning of life this movie somehow manages to seamlessly blend all of these themes into its narrative using the oldest trick in the book when it comes to exploring themes dialogue this movie has amazing dialogue between its characters and truly makes them feel like real people by having them swear use slang and occasionally joke while discussing the themes mentioned above a round of applause for martin mcdonagh who wrote and directed the film and truly breathed life into his workso to summarize is an absolutely incredible movie with interesting themes fantastic performances and very good direction its refreshing to see such a well made comedy which knows that humor alone is not what makes a movie great despite its somewhat underrated status i consider this film to be a mustwatch for anyone and everyonethe end,black_comedy
hi this is my first time writing a review about a movie  and im glad the first is for this great movie and i wanted to my first review being for a movie that worth it  and im sure that absolutely worth itworth the time and worth to keep this movie in my collectioni really enjoyed watching this movie and i like the characters and everything and damn i really liked the city of bruges it was a great beautiful city i dont know why ray hated bruges this much anyway thank you director and crew and anyone involved for this great movie i enjoyed my time thank you it was worth itrate 810 i had seen better before and i gave 10 to only 3 movies before so yeah 8 is good i think thank you again,black_comedy
came out in 2008 to raves reviews and awards like the golden globes and 1 oscar in this 1hr 47mins of funny moments of comedy and 2 hitman on the run and throw in some drama to the mix in a weirdest tourist town in in belgium for a film i gave this film 810 guiltstricken after a job gone wrong hitman ray and his partner await orders from their ruthless boss belgium the last place in the world ray wants to be directormartin mcdonagh first film is a stylish black comedy thriller staring ralph fiennes as harry a family man but a cold blooded hitman with a vicious london crime boss who sends his boys to a picturesque city to lay low for more orders when ken played by  brendan gleeson he plays this character very good trying keep colin farrell character a playboy fast talking partner from going crazy and running away but sets out on an adventure with ray meeting skinheads surreal tourists a another film set with dwarfs on a euro thrash film and prostitutes and when the last call comes from harry the fun turns to life or death situation as colin farrells performance won him a deserved best performance by an actor in a motion picture  comedy or musical in a golden globe and meeting other lowlifes along the way abusing over weight tourist his character doesnt like the tourist side of bruges also nominated for oscar best writing original screenplay martin mcdonagh this is a kind of irish film following harrys advice takes in the sights of the medieval city with great appreciation but the charms of bruges are lost on the simpler ray who is already despondent over the innocent death especially as it was his first job things change for ray when he meets chloe part of a film crew shooting a movie starring an american dwarf named jimmy when harrys instructions arrive ken for whom the job is directed isnt sure if he can carry out the new job especially as he has gained a new appreciation of life from his stay in the fairy tale bruges while ken waits for the inevitable arrival into bruges of an angry harry who feels he must clean up matters on his own ray is dealing with his own issues ive really liked colin farrell but who knew he had such a good sense of comedic timing there is a running gag involving fighting with a bottle and karate that he manages to keep fresh as it pops up throughout the film brendan gleesons character provides the moral center and plays the straight man to farrells ray this works well as the movie turns more serious towards the end however for my money the best performance is delivered by ralph fiennes who plays harry the pairs criminal overlord back in london whereas gleeson character embodies the moral center fienness harry fills the role of principled immorality plays the straight man to farrells ray this works well as the movie turns more serious towards the end however for my money the best performance is delivered by ralph fiennes who plays harry the pairs criminal overlord back in london whereas gleeson character embodies the moral center fienness harry fills the role of principled immorality if there is such a thing if there is such a thing fiennes creates a character with a dubious moral center and is a quite believable figure of shoot first sightsee later after seeing the trailer looked like a plodding british comedy with little originality and repetitious humor hence the low expectations yet exceeded my minimal expectations and unlike my impression from the trailer was an original drama with good acting and a nice blend of comedy mixed in it was funny in the right places and appropriately dramatic when the story shifted into high gear towards the end the another aspect of the film worked for me was rays love interest early in the film he manages to woo chloe a drug dealer with drum roll please a heart of gold for my tastes the budding romance comes across more as a vehicle for jokes and drama but its a small thing and i doubt anyone but me would notice i intentionally left a lot of plot points out because as ive mentioned this film surprised me in a good way and i dont wont to ruin it for anyone elseis a good film go see it,black_comedy
at the beginning you know that they are bad guys but you aint sure how bad later on when you find out it just keeps you amazed they are very violent but seem calm and like normal people acting is amazing the are three powerful actors and they performance just lifted movie up doubt and friendship between farrell and gleeson characters is amazing as they go through tough time intelligently written screenplay keeps this movie as one of the better in crime area colin is very strong actor as he proved it also here as struggling with killing of a child after their boss comes at them its just chaotic and violent as hes pursuing ray through bruges after finally shooting ray he also shot a boy and in believe that its dead he takes his life that is a powerful thing to do very twisty plot but it makes movie even better ending is moving as farrells character is in ambulance and going to hospital but audience has no idea what is going to happen to him as we are left to choose his destiny by ourselves brilliant writing and screenplay is done by mcdonagh 354,black_comedy

i cant really say in enough words how much i love in fact there arent words in my language which can express how deeply in tune to it i feel every time i put the dvd in for a watch which is at least every four months or so the dual forces of comedy and tragedy have combined here using martin mcdonoughs genius script writing as an avatar to create something raucously funny and profoundly moving the comedy is of the spiciest and very darkest nature my favourite and the tragedy tugs at both the heart strings and the tear ducts scarcely giving you time to wipe away the tears of laughter from the scene that came before the best in uk crime fare some of the most balanced peculiar writing and fully rounded characters who are as flawed as human beings get colin farrell delves deep and gives the performance of his career as ray a would be hitman who has messed up bad and now heads for bruges its in belgium with his mentor ken brendan gleeson pure brilliance and humble class ken loves eccentric little bruges with its historical architecture and quaint townsfolk ray is bored to tears and pouts like a toddler they meander around the town getting into all sorts of mischief including a dwarf who has fascinating ideas about the ultimate race war museums cocaine the belgium film industry and more ray sets his sights on the gorgeous chloe  and ken does his paternal best to keep him out of trouble while wrestling with his own gnawing guilt the film gets a shot of pissy adrenaline when their boss harry comes looking for them in the form of a knock it out of the park funny ralph fiennes fiennes rarely cuts loose and bounces off the walls like he does here and his harry is a delightful creature to watch in action angry petty volatile clever and out for blood just a joy to behold as playful as the script is theres a purgatorial sadness to rays situation a fateful sense that hes been dumped not just to fool around get drunk and utter witty barbs in that brogue which he does do a lot but to deeply ruminate on his choices and ponder where his actions will lead him moving forward from his terrible deed maturity permeates each exchange between him and ken a fledgling and an old timer shooting the breeze about heavy topics which neither of them pretend to understand but both are neck deep in i always cry at certain scenes always laugh my ass off at others and never cease to be affected right to my emotional center and the marrow of my funny bone each time i watch this look for a brief cameo from ciaran hinds in the opening few minutes every second of this piece is filled with lush thought provoking dialogue awesomely unpolitically correct dialogue that doesnt censor a single impulse from its characters and a yearning to explore the decisions which cause people to be labeled good or bad something thats inherently complex yet feels lightly treaded on here masterpiece,black_comedy
did you just watch fargo and are now left wanting for something equally as dark and funny look no further is the tale of a a depressed hitman who is granted the opportunity to visit bruges a town known for his history and one which he hates he stumbles upon a no name midget actor who ends up interfering with his local love interest a local groupie who ends up trying to rob him though more interested in his companionship she forgoes her fiduciary pursuits in older to pursue her suicidal love meanwhile our protagonist has been ordered dead by his boss for reasons unmentioned spoilers all in all this is a dark comedy with ample surprises and a witty script 910 would watch again,black_comedy
pun intendedin the kind of film weve seen so many times before from both britain and hong kong buddy killers go to another country to lie low after a hit but thats not the only reason theyve been moved out of the picturewhat separates from all these other flicks is the fact that it has moments that are entirely psyourpants funny the actors all do a great job the pacing of the film is superb and the soundtrack captures the tone and setting excellently  i honestly cant recall the last time i commented positively on a soundtrackhowever the ending is both predictable and illogical  given the inconsistencies in damage  which really led me to reducing a stellar 8star film to a 7 which is definitely still greatps not everyone will get the humour of the film but for those who do you wont be disappointed,black_comedy
ive seen one other movie from martin mcdonagh seven psychopaths that one happens to be in one of my top 5 favourite movies so i thought id see something else from martin mcdonagh since the guy seems to know what hes doing hes an excellent writer and it can be seen in as well mcdonagh is phenomenal at writing dialogue its natural yet colourful and while it might not be the most politically correct it works and no one is trying to convince that the characters of this movie would be extremely good people still the moral code of the characters is interesting they are hit men criminals yet killing an innocent little boy is clearly wrong and all of them seem to agree on that the view of some of them might just be harder than othersthe music affects this movie a lot in the beginning the dialogue sounds more like a comedy but the music makes the whole thing feel like a weird european drama the copy i rented just had the genre comedy listed in the back nothing else and the beginning gave me a lot of mixed feelings about that since the beginning seems rather serious  apart from the dialogue other than that the music mostly amplified the feeling of the movie at every point the beginning just stands out if youre not preparedbut is this film really a comedy well if it is it certainly isnt the typical simple joke kind of funny its extremely dark funny i was actually surprised at what kind of stuff i found myself chuckling at this shows how wide the comedy genre actually is since it includes typical comedies such as 21 jump street not too funny but cheerful movies like the grand budapest hotel and then really dark comedies like and death to smoochyin bruged wasnt what i expected considering the quite crappy description behind the dvd cover still i enjoyed it however it was quite slow sometimes still the story is intriguing and so are the characters definitely worth seeing,black_comedy
colin farrell is a very underrated actor his performance in this movie was amazing his character was interestingly complicated and he did a brilliant job playing it the entire atmosphere of the movie will take you to another world with the amazing cinematography and the wonderful soundtrack the movie will keep you interested throughout the entire running time but it can be a little too violent in some scenesthe movie is well written the funny scenes and the emotional parts mixed perfectly making it an outstanding moviethe ending is the best thing about the movie it was a perfect ending to a perfect movie,black_comedy
hit men ray and ken have been told to lay low and await orders a city in belgium after a job gone wrong while ken is happy to relax and sightsee ray could not be unhappier of course aside from the fact that ray does not care for the cultural offerings of their surroundings he is also dealing with past wrongdoings that play heavily on his consciencewhile this may sound like the makings of a dour story not that theres anything wrong with dour stories i love them i do not think any film has made me sad and then laugh in immediate succession without devolving into parody this movie may be the only one that has and does so more than once indeed i sometimes laughed whilst i was sad and rather than the integrity of the scene being ruined i was confounded should i be laughing or crying i say without devolving into parody because some films unintentionally make light of the more downbeat moments thus detracting from them does not fall into this trap yes the film can be classified as a black comedy and yes much of the often very dark humour is amongst the funniest ive come across in my time watching films however the more serious portions of the film which mostly deal with rays struggle with his guilt are truly sincere and heartfeltcolin farrell gives a truly great performance he makes it easy to sympathise with ray you really feel sorry for him it seems to me that farrell generally is not given the respect he deserves as an actor this maybe more a reflection of the roles he chooses rather than his ability if you dont like colin farrell watch and maybe youll change your mindbrendan gleeson as always is excellent as the older ken ken may be a hitman but its hard to believe due to his warm amiable and gentle nature at the same time gleeson also manages to bring a certain gravity to the role notwithstanding his trade ken could very well be a role model for a young man at least in terms of his mannerisms ken is like a father figure to ray he genuinely cares for rays wellbeingthe foulmouthed character of harry rays and kens boss is played by well i wont say if you do not know already its better to find out when you watch the film perhaps youll be surprised even though we only hear harry over the phone for the first half or more of the film he exudes a strong presencenone of the main characters i refer to ray ken and harry are truly despicable yes theyve committed evil deeds and are deeply flawed however they all have their principles many of them actually honourable and stick to them this instils respect in ones heart for the characters if not unreserved love but how can you not love kenthe film also looks very good the nighttime scenes in particular stand out especially the ones with fog you might say its like a fairytale or somethinglast but not least is the dark and pensive score by carter burwell which exemplifies the themes of guilt and redemption and really underscores rays anguish burwell is fast becoming one of my favourite composersis a dark film imbued with much humour pathos and humanity it succeeds because of its characters it is one of my favourite films and i hope you feel the same after watching it,black_comedy
this action drama centers around three characters from a criminal organisation two hit men and their boss become involved in a situation that creates unusual circumstances and outcomes the relationship between the characters are complex and change continually throughout the movie the movie is also set in a town in belgium which creates a different setting and environment from the main characters own experience many local characters also become involved with the hit men developing additional story lines that interweave with the overall direction of the film many of the characters are quirky giving the movie a slight art house appeal they acting is great which allows the usual characters to be believable in the situations at hand this is a great crime drama with a number of twists and a different overall ending than expected,black_comedy
our senses often become so jaded by continuous moviewatching that past a point nothing excites us anymore we begin to recognize the structural tropes and anticipate the twists and turns before they make an appearance on screen vigorous attempts of movie makers fall flat before our indifferent eyes it has been my problem for a while now and then this movie came along with its simple premise and after a long time i was immersed in a movie experience the plot is simple enough two contract killers complete a hit job assigned to them and obeying the orders from their boss come to the dutch town called bruges apparently to lay low for a while younger one ray collin farrell seems like he has not yet hardened enough to fit comfortably into the mold of his job older one ken brendan gleeson has already come to terms with the demands of his profession he treats ray like his kid brother and is very indulgent towards rays constant complaints and bickering over their having to spend time in this ancient and dull bruges this irritableness of ray is later established to have a deeper source for a reason he has a guilt upon his conscience too heavy for his professional experiencethat of accidentally killing a boy during a botched hit job this guilt drives his thoughts towards death but what he doesnt know yet is that that is the very fate for the fulfillment of which he was sent to burges even ken doesnt realize it until an order to kill ray comes to him from the boss what kevin does and the later consequences consist the rest of the story this movie is a marvel of storytelling it reminds us again what little details are enough to make a compelling story it creates its own world the rules of which barely correspond with the real or even cinematic worlds that we are accustomed to every image and event are premeditated and accounted for and the setting of bruges is interwoven so skillfully within the screenplay that it becomes an active character itself i stumbled upon this movie without realizing that the director is the same person who later went on to made seven psychopaths another movie that i loved very much ive observed many people comparing martin mcdonagh with tarantino but i think this director is going his own way and doing his own thing he is added to my list of directors whose imdb accounts i keep checking to see if they are making anything new,black_comedy
so it started a bit slow ranting about bruges and where the hell is it but then things got more clear and just the plot got more interestingthe movie idea is thorough filled with drama tense scenes emotional irish dark humor and comedy bits and some thrilling action in the end even somehow sad the cast from colin farrell brendan gleeson to ralph fiennes theyre so engaging and so into character i actually was a bit hesitant whether i watch it or not cuz i didnt really expect much of it since its now a 7 years old movie and it turned to be more than i expected i think the movie didnt get much recognition that year maybe its not in the level of no country for old men or there will be blood but it definitely deserved a bit more publicitythe story is really intriguing and always keeps you wants to know what happens next it has the element of unpredictability which also gave it a mysterious look started from the first minutes the guys arrive brugesanyway i cant believe why until this year i waited to watch it  but i finally did,black_comedy
i cant believe this film is currently rated so high over here it looks good for the first couple of minutes but soon you realize its going to be rubbish mainly because of one of the poorest scripts i can remember in recent timesthe dialogues are so badly written as to become really worried about mcdonaghs future in the business if he insists on shooting his own material hes technically quite correct as a director although there are some worrying choices in that department too like the rather too long sightseeing sequences of bruges that sometimes feel like youre watching a travel documentary instead of a movieand the dialogues oh boy they are trying so hard to be funny smart and witty a la tarantino but they fail miserably some of the stuff like the midget discussing whose side hed be on if a war between dwarfs was to start sorry i cant remember the silly unfunny details are downright embarrassing and so are other bits during the whole movie the storytelling is not exactly brilliant eitherbrendan gleeson is quite good farrell is annoying as hell and fiennes overdoes it a bit too muchnot worth your time or your money avoid,black_comedy
after watching the lady killers and reading all the reviews here saying it was not funny and then watching and seeing all the reviews calling it funny humorous hilarious and entertaining i have to wonder if the world has truly gone mad i decided to finally give this movie a try after hearing an interview with brendan gleeson on fresh air with terry gross i will say this for the film it is powerful has beautiful cinematography all round fine acting and a good score i can even see elements of black humor like the encounter in the park  im not obtuse but unless you enjoy seeing graphic senseless violence in myriad forms and find it funny to see it repeated over and over and over i dont think you can call it funny humorous or even entertaining and certainly not hilarious i would also call it unforgettable which sadly i prefer to do with such violent fareive lost count of all the violence but i do know we get to witness in graphic detail two suicides one by blowing his head off with a gun in his mouth the other by jumping off a tower onto the pavement two children lying in pools of blood from accidental shootings a contract shooting or two a blinding a beating to death a beating to near death a shooting victim who inexplicably lives and probably more that i dont remember the endless gratuitous violence in makes fargo look like a currier and ives christmas cardwhats the point killing people is now a joke in the 21st century tell that to norway there seem to be some unexplained plot elements like why ray shot the priest in the confessional i dont recall him receiving any instructions or even getting a gun i also dont see how the little boy got shot accidentally maybe i missed something but i am not going to go back to figure it out in the real world the shooting of a priest and a small boy would be in the news nothing and ray goes bragging about it to a woman hes just met this is not realism it is adolescent fantasythere are people who enjoy watching graphic violence there are american films that cater to those tastes but i never watch them then you see foreigners who think these films are realistic depictions of america i presume and sincerely hope this is not a realistic depiction of brits or europeans im not quite as sure about russians from what i read in the news more to the point is this movie an indicator of european tastesstepping back for a moment i think what this film indicates is that there are serious social and moral problems in most places drugs violence prostitution murder there also seems to be a decline in aesthetics due to hyperstimulation demanding more and more intense experiences so that some people have lost the ability to appreciate subtlety and delicacy of humor such as in the lady killers i suppose there is a place for films like which is a sort of 21st century take on fellini surrealism i would have found it more palatable without the graphic gore and violence even though it is fiction and make believe i find it still tends to deaden the soul frankly i found it a degrading experience to be dragged through this sewerbut not everyone agrees oddly enough bruges the city has worked the movie into its tourism marketing i hear tourism is upso whats next for martin mcdonagh how about a week in the life of two sadistic serial killers or a mass murderer who blows up buildings and shoots up a childrens camp or a suicide bomber who hijacks a school bus those movies should be a barrel of laughs for this crowdspoiler alertthe ending is bogus harry shoots ray with a large caliber dumdum bullet clear through and he not only lives but ray runs half way across town with harry in chase so harry shoots him again and again and again yet ray is carried off on a stretcher alive and conscious you must be kidding is this one of the jokes others find so hilariousthe whole point of dumdum bullets is that they mushroom on impact shear open shredding the innards of the victim beyond any hope of medical help and remain there in fragments instead of passing through the body intact as shown in the film death is usually nearly instantaneous  a dumdum bullet is designed to stop a rampaging animal dead in its tracks  or human  with a single shot you would not see a bloody exit wound in the back look it up note to imdb on spell checker its d u m d u m not dumb dumb,black_comedy
in newspapers they wrote that genre of this movie is comedy but i am not sure  colin farrell was very good but he cannot make this movie great  there are many things which i didnt understand  first which genre is this movie  crime  no action  i am not sure  drama  close to dramathriller i cannot see why  comedy  definitely not  then what is second why is it such good movie  why is it so good rated  third what is the point of the movie  maybe i was too strict  movie has good parts but they arent well connected  i really enjoyed in views of bruges  movie is illuminated but there are some parts which arent enjoyable  i can see that it is made with some black humor which has dramatic and i can tell tragic parts,black_comedy
beautiful scenes of bruges  an above average performance by farrell can not save this clunker for starters every line in this movie sounds like it was written for maximum irony or humor there isnt a single line that sounds like something someone in such a scenario would actually say secondly every plot development is predictable  completely implausible if its true that bruges has no police  that no one ever calls the police when crimes are committed it would seem to be reasonable to conclude that bruges would be the hub of criminal activity in europe but its not  peoples behavior in this movie is just completely implausible from beginning to end the director so obviously drags out the final scene with what is probably supposed to increase tension for the viewer but its really just tiresome how many times does he have to shoot the farrel character  not do it how many times does the farrel character have to get away but just stand there to what for him to catch up it has all the subtlety of a film students final project finally ralph fiennes cant act  hes particularly atrocious in this thing im surprised by all the praise heaped on this rather derivative hip gangster flick but then again the quality here on imdb really has taken a nosedive over the past decade if flashy hip gangsta films are your thing then maybe youll enjoy this but if you really want to laugh lock stock  2 smoking barrels has many more laughs  feels more natural than this thing in spite of its more implausible scenarios,black_comedy
im not one of those people who cant stomach violence in a movie rather im find with violence as long as it fits the story and isnt gratuitousthe vast majority of is an absolute scream i never knew that colin ferrel could do comedy like he does the dialog which is very tongue and cheek and politically in correct had me in stitches throughout the idea of hit men with ethics could have become tiring pretty quickly but the director makes it work for the whole moviemy only grip is the incredible violence in the last five minutes the story line probably required the killing that occurs but why did it have to be incredibly graphic i have no idea why directors feel the need to spray blood all over the screen in a final climax in this way the movie is like an american movie with the inevitable final chase scenestill a very witty film,black_comedy
two killers find themselves in the medieval town of bruges for a little involuntary rnr after a hit goes tragically wrong one of the shooters ken brendan gleeson finds the old city quaint and fascinating the other ray colin farrell despises it as a boring backwater in a tedious country both the leads and ralph fiennes who plays their profane volatile boss harry are excellent in a clever sharply scripted story of a short but bloody path to redemption religious symbolism is deftly woven in throughout the movie in which bruges serves as heaven purgatory or hell depending on the character including imagery from hieronymus boschs famous painting last judgment itself sort of a black comedy overall an excellent if somewhat violent and profanityrich film,black_comedy
there are not many movies i stop watching after the first half hour has passed  this was one of them it is advertised as an intelligent comedy then we see a boy about 10 years old murdered by a head shot yeah comedy and the murderer hiding picks up a local lady tells her on a dinner date that he is a hired gun and starts a bar brawl with their neighbor and his girlfriend yeah intelligenti suppose no police arrived at the scene arrested him and compared his fingerprints to the one he left on a sheet of paper that belonged to the boy he murdered we saw him do that in the murder sceneim sorry but i really dont know why i should care for stories taking place in this parallel universe,black_comedy
i just watched again after a gap of maybe two years it gets better every time i see it as i always see something new in the story the acting  everythingbrendan gleeson in particular is a consummate actor and in my humble opinion deserved to have won every award he has ever been nominated for this was certainly an oscarworthy performance from brendan and close to that from the other key actors tooyes its violent and visceral and theres a lot of swearing but its the language we might expect from characters like these not for the kids or the fainthearted then but everyone else should go see this masterclass in jet black comedy,black_comedy
is an extraordinarily clever dark comedy about conflicted irish hitmen cooling their heels well the plot twists and turns as crazily but purposefully as the streets of the medieval city in which it is set the acting is spot on throughoutthe actors clearly enjoying the jokesand in several scenes the writerdirector manages to draw breathtakingly exquisite comedy from the most apparently serious conversations if youre going to kill a man in an alcove you want to know youre using the right word after all this is actually one of the best movies ever made and represents a signal achievement odd that it didnt get more recognition than it did but its subject matter and strange humor may have just been too taut to allow comparisons with 2001 or the godfather its not quite as good as the former though almost and a lot better than the latter puts citizen kane in the shade which is like spending three hours well,black_comedy
all i could muster to say after watching was nothing literally dumb stuck on how brilliant this movie was read quite a few reviews complaining about soundtrack not in sync with the story line but for me that was mesmerizing what can be better than the on raglan road by the dubliners for that particular scene  do not want to put spoilers here but that scene stole the show colin farrell  his best performance so far quirky yet emotional brendan gleeson  brilliant would be an understatement for his portrayal of ken ralph fiennes  i now cannot imagine anyone as harry but him the message he leaves with the motel owner receptionist was hilariously accusingstars of the moviestory  have never seen any movie with such a story this for me has raised the bar for defining good movies  completely off shelf fresh though its a movie on hit men it will make you feel sympathetic towards all characters in the movie though they have grey shadesbruges  the film is extensively shot a medieval city beautifully shot excellent cinematography i just fell in love with this place and now bruges is on my dream list of places to visitdialogues  quick quirky funny and yet speaks a lot about integrity and humanity harrys role stands out you got to stick with your principlessoundtrack  excellent tracks through out the movie absolutely fitting scores matching the beautiful city and again on raglan road with that particular scene gives me goose bumps its a must watch movie a complete fresh way of looking at things though it has a serious story line the way it has been written makes it funny yet emotional quirky yet soothing cruel yet sympathetic do not miss thisalso like to share this poem on raglan road by patrick kavanagh sung by the dublinerson raglan road on an autumn day i met her first and knew that her dark hair would weave a snare that i might one day rue i saw the danger yet i walked along the enchanted way and i said let grief be a fallen leaf at the dawning of the day on grafton street in november we tripped lightly along the ledge of the deep ravine where can be seen the worth of passions pledge the queen of hearts still making tarts and i not making hay  o i loved too much and by such and such is happiness thrown away i gave her gifts of the mind i gave her the secret sign thats known to the artists who have known the true gods of sound and stone and word and tint i did not stint for i gave her poems to say with her own name there and her own dark hair like clouds over fields of may on a quiet street where old ghosts meet i see her walking now away from me so hurriedly my reason must allow that i had wooed not as i should a creature made of clay  when the angel woos the clay hed lose his wings at the dawn of dayheaven,black_comedy
i highly recommend this film for any quentin tarantino or guy ritchie films but really to any lover of film there is a reason films like this arent big hollywood block buster hits because it is a highly original dialogue driven film that will go places you couldnt foresee happening this is a hilarious dark comedy which may be a little to dark for some especially one scene in particular about mid way through but i really consider it more of a crime drama than a comedy the best way to watch this film is to watch it without seeing any trailers or reading any reviews that contain spoilers so you can get the best experience when you watch it the premise seems simple two hit men hiding out after a recent job but trust me when i say it is much more complex than that if you enjoy this film i highly recommend watching martin mcdonaghs second feature seven psychopaths also i havent seen many shorts but his first and only short six shooterwhich won an academy award i have seen many times its only about 30minutes in length and features a simple premise as well but it is a powerful 30 minutes and you can watch the entire thing for free on youtube  just search six shooter martin mcdonagh,black_comedy
im going to start with the good things about this movie 1the great crew of actors and their well done acting we have colin farrell brendan gleeson and ralph fiennes who was the best of them all he appeared the least but did a hell of a job but that doesnt mean the others failed all of them made this movie good and this is one of the reasons i enjoyed it 2the place the title says it i dont know if that is where the movie is really shot but still it is a beautiful small town and we get a chance to see it in more than one scene 3the story and the twist colins characterray is a hitman and comes with brendans characterken because he accidentally killed a little boy what they dont know is that ralphs characterharry sent them there so that ray could have nice time before ken killed him but of course that is not so simple in the end harry has to come and do the job himself and he ends up having the same faith as ray expect he didnt kill a little boy but a dwarf and he doesnt realize thatthe things that didnt make this movie awesome 1it was quite slowquiet and at moments boring the only action we see is in the last 10 minutes but if you like interesting dialog it should be ok 2when i searched it here at imdb they tagged it as a comedy first it definitely isnt it has veryvery little humor if you know to recognize it because the characters arent even trying to be funny and funnily enough thats the funny 3almost all the three main characters diei didnt like that i usually connect with the characters and i dont want them to die but sometimes i accept a tragic end if it will make the movie great and maybe it does for this one any way if you dont mind if the lead actors die then you should enjoy it,black_comedy
pretty vulgar pretty ultraviolent and some pretty cinematography are things that are the attraction here announcing itself as something hip and cutting edge it is not this type of thing used to be unconventional before scorsese tarantino and the overrated onetrick pony guy ritchienow this movie seems familiar but yet it is still new enough to gain some attention and some overpraising there is some fun in this that is not without its price excessive and redundant at times it can be an entertaining if a deficiency of taste is to your liking this does show that colin farrell can be a likable and effective actor in fact the performers here are all up for this ostentatious offering its a crude and funny attempt at something or another about despicable characters with a tender side and the audience is suppose to believe that there is beauty if one looks everywhere even if the surface is horrifying like a painting by boschthe ending is the weakest part of this otherwise successful but rapidly becoming overused story and one cannot help but wonder when the curtain will finally drop because this type of thing is now found itself to be clichd,black_comedy

i had actually never heard of this movie before watching it for the first time the other night and let me start off by saying i was very pleasantly surprised the acting was great ferrel did an excellent job and the way they mixed the comedy with an intense story i just loved it the humor was actually really funny tooafter hitman ray kills the wrong person during a hit his boss sends him to bruge to lay low and ease off some of the guilt of killing the innocent personthis movie was really good it was a fresh interesting idea and it was hilarious and at the same time it was really brutal,black_comedy
the film tells the story of two individuals who land for a vacation as told by their employer their past is haunting them and they deal with it during their stay the story is good but what makes the film better is the acting and occasional use of humorpros i have always liked black comedies this film does not contain that much humor as is present in different films of this genre but it manages to induce laughter sometimes owing to the acting of colin farrell the story moves slowly and you might feel bored in the starting the ambiance of the film is cold and silent after the first half you will feel happy that you started this film another good thing is that there are not too many characters so the details of the story are limited acting by all is top notch and colin farrell definitely deserved an award for this the ending was superbmessage you have to stick to your principles verdict a recommended watch,black_comedy
is martin mcdonaghs first feature film after his oscar winning short film six shooter stars brendan gleeson and colin farell as two hit men ray and ken being told to hideout and await further instructions from their boss harry played by ralph fiennes in london the film has all of martin mcdonaghs traits and style eg lots of cursing lots of blood and violence and lots of black comedy his style isnt for everyone and his comedy is defiantly not for everyone however if he is for you youll think hes the best in the world but aside from whether hes your cup of tea or not you have to appreciate the storyline the acting and most defiantly the script is one of the best films to release in the last few years and defiantly 2008 it is an undeniable little gem that im sure people have missed but since ive seen it ive been hooked on what hes done previously and what he will do in the future hes a brilliant writer and a great director and you can tell he works well with the actors as colin farell was brilliant in itgreat film 810,black_comedy
for a film appreciation i took my first year of college this was one of the films we watched we watched the first half with subtitles on in order to help us understand what exactly was going on i would honestly recommend watching it was the subtitles for the first half this movie is a little hard to understand at first because of their accents but aside from that its just wonderful the way some of the scenes were filmed you could defiantly tell that they didnt just turn on the camera and say go every scene and camera placement was perfectpersonally to me this film felt so real nothing in this was held back emotionally and physically if you watch it youll know what i mean by physically at the end,black_comedy
is a rather unusual genre mix with many funny moments but also a couple of lengths and a more or less convincing story line the movie mixes many comedy elements with romantic bits and pieces a suspenseful background story some cultural elements and a little bit of actionsometimes this mix gets a little bit odd at some points this movie is more like a tourist guide through bruges and therefor a weird kind of documentary rather than a film with a coherent developmentbut the true problem lies elsewhere the characters are so diversified that they simply arent authentic anymore in my humble opinion the funny guy in love suddenly is the calm and suicidal victim the pitiless and very emotional boss suddenly becomes the consequent killer that discusses about the morality of life and death the old and very rational killer is suddenly let by strong emotions and risks his whole existence the sadly inevitable love story of this flick is also overused and not authentic at allnext to these complex and strange characters there are many stereotypical persons that appear in this movie that might make you laugh at first sight but that get quite redundant after a while for example the dwarf or the gunrunner this contrast is what makes this movie quite entertaining and surprising on one side but also rather odd and torn apart on the negative side i can understand people that would rate this movie under five points and people that would give it a top rating the whole thing heavily depends on your personal taste if youre openminded and just want to live a strange odyssey the chances are good that you might at least appreciate this somehow experimental film but if youre looking for something coherent gripping and more traditional in terms of suspense or comedy flick you should watch a detailed trailer before you get your hands on a copy of thisthe strongest point of this feature is definitely the dirty humour i know many people that actually adore bruges i have been there and must admit that even though im pretty much interested in arts and history this town is pretty boring and almost appeared as a sleepy ghost town to me filled with tourists and their guides and a couple of old people thats why i can really laugh about the stereotypical descriptions of that city and the extreme discussions about its strong and weak points these discussions and the slapstick elements in many unpredictable situations were my favourite parts in the filmi disliked the character development basically the whole plot and the lack of true suspense after all there were only episodes bits and pieces of the movie that i appreciated while there were also many unnecessary lengths sometimes i was extremely bored then suddenly extremely addicted to this movie in the end this feature was worth to be watched and gets some credit for its experimental originality this is something different from anything i have seen before its not always different in good terms but it was refreshing but also exhausting to discover something that unusual i would though watch it again as this flick has the potential to become a cult movie and might also grow on me,black_comedy
is moderately fair as a nutty character study but overly farfetched once the action kicks in two irish hit men colin farrell and brendan gleeson get up to no good after being sent to the belgian city of brugesthe film is a darkly comic scabrously witty farce that takes a puerile glee in being casually offensive the result is great fun until it starts taking itself seriously but its a laughoutloud dark comedy was nominated for an academy award for best original screenplay in 2009 but lost to milk in the same year it won the irish film and television awards for best international film,black_comedy
surprisingly good movie i rather liked the dark comedy element of the whole thing the dynamic between colin farrell brendan gleeson and ralph fiennes was great those 3 really made the movie for me the movie made me laugh out loud in quite a few spots two hit men wandering around aimlessly is not really my type of thing but the script is so clever that you somehow end up marveling at the whole ridiculous story i never cared much for farrell as an actor  he always seems to be playing these annoying schmucks  but here hes just hilarious especially the way he plays off brendan gleesons character he is sooooooo bored out of his skull by being that you almost feel sorry for him while gleeson is taking in the sites and all the architecture that bruges has to offer farrell looks like hes about to crack up or lose his mind hes that bored hilarious stuff,black_comedy
the movie centers around two characters who at first sight seem to have a life where they dont care about anything but they have inner demons that do not let them advance and take the right direction and i mean serious matters from the pasttheres plenty of black humor drugdealing oriented situations a midget that will make you laugh out loud because of his dialogs and more this is a movie that those like me who enjoy mob related topics should enjoy oh but dont expect action and shootings this one focuses more on character developmentloved the dinner scene where collin farrell beats a couple and overall his romance with the sexy blonde actress kens ending is very movingps bruges looks spectacular,black_comedy
from start to finish this film is enjoyable the only thing i wasnt really contend with was colin farells portrayal of his character but it was acceptable enough to me to enjoy the film and it wasnt bad at all perhaps it played a part that im not a very big fan of his work in general and started to watch with some scepticism is funny here and there i laughed out loud a few times and the action is good sometimes the dialogues seemed to be a bit forced trying to be cool and funny and not working out like that but nothing hysterically bad in my opinion it is not a very good film but it is 4decent and enjoyable and has some very good things in it that are worth seeing certainly there are many many worse films out there and the midget should never kill himself great performance ,black_comedy
2008a quiet film about a couple of hit men hiding one of them loving it played by brendan gleeson and the other colin farrell bored and unappreciative they run into trouble in several ways mainly learning that they are not there to hide out after all but this only turns into a kind of shoot em up climax that isnt what the movies arc really intends a couple of side characters have some effect on events mainly a drug running love interest clemence poesy who is meant to be searing and different but comes off a bit stilted and a dwarf in a movie being filmed there jordan prentice who is charming and a little incidental after allwhat really works best is the screenplay the writing is sharp and the idea offbeat within a large and wellworked genre develops with some nice turns oddly the back and forth humor between these hit men doesnt quite gel despite their good dialog and i think its just bad casting or bad directing because gleeson and farrell sure are trying to be ironic and wry and a bit doltish maybe they try too hard or maybe it really is the direction under martin mcdonagh who did also help with the writing this is mcdonaghs first full fledged film he made an earlier prescient short six shooter also starring gleeson the complexity of the plot isnt overwhelming but the threads seems to coexist rather than interweave it gets especially singleminded and heavy handed when the master hitman arrives played beautifully by ralph fiennes the violence becomes a series of tricks and spectacular effects and its entertaining but never quite gripping or enchanting or whatever it is this strange series of events is aiming forbruges which plays its own role in the film is gorgeous even for a hitman and the film was filmed there for good reason but expect only a slight diversion here one bubbling with possibility but falling flat on the tongue,black_comedy
i thought that this movies story was excellent the characters help guide the audience through the different twist and turns of the story this movie is very different than a lot of popular comedyaction movies because it is dark and depressing most comedyaction movies such as kiss kiss bang bang or rush hour have a bright uplifting plot that entices the audience but also puts them in a good mood is the opposite of this it still has a very enthralling plot but this movie leaves you feeling satisfied and also slightly depressed in the end considering that almost every vital character dies the director martin mcdonagh includes very dark themes such as suicide and loss of selfidentity in this movie but somehow this movie still has a witty comedic undertone overalls actionfilled satirical plot makes it one of the best films of the decade the cinematography and editing in the film is excellent the town of bruges is a magical medieval town that is expressed with great beauty in this movie almost every person that sees this movie will instantly fall in love with the town of bruges the beautiful canals and parks make this city one of the most beautiful in the world cinematically and in real life one of the most breathtaking scenes is when ken first goes to the top of the clock tower the camera pans out onto a beautiful horizon of classical medieval buildings as far as the eye can see also this movie makes great use of the quick dark shots of the main characters with half of their face in shadow and half in light this technique can be seen in movies such as alfred hitchcocks rear window and the usual suspects a wonderful example of this technique is the scene where ray is in the confessional with the priest the camera shows a great shot of the divider between the confessional showing the priests dark face as he talks to ray another great sequence in this scene is when the camera follows ray as he follows the crawling priest into the main chapel the editing in this movie is also great every scene in the movie serves a specific purpose and all of the actors seem to know their role in every scene the movie seems the perfect length the length where you get the full effect of the movie without being hackneyed by the same characters and setting overall i think that the cinematography and editing in this movie are great and they are two of the many things that add up to make this movie greatthe acting in is wonderful the actors all serve a specific purpose and they portray their characters with poise and accuracy many of these actors have little or no experience but they still portray their characters with the effectiveness of a veteran colin farrell plays ray the energetic but lonely rookie hit man that struggles with the guilt of killing a young boy farrell plays this role with oscar wining effort he goes from one minute being a funny outgoing young man to bearing the stress and loneliness that seems to come with the job farrells facial expressions in this movie pretty much make the movie whether he is displaying a comic sarcastic face responding to a remark by his partner or the sad dreary look of a man without a cause farrell executes his role to perfection and once again shows why he is one of the best actors in hollywood brendan gleeson plays the calm surprisingly moral filled character of ken gleeson plays the role of ken with the acting skills of a seasoned veteran with something to prove before this gleeson has played minor supporting roles such as reynald de chatillon in kingdom of heaven and monk mcginn in the scorsese hit gangs of new york gleesons role in this movie is much more important to the plot and he plays this role wonderfully gleeson is the calm collective character that keeps this movie in check in the face of extreme action danger and chaos the character of ken seems to hold the movie together at the seams i would compare gleesons character of ken to william holdens character of pike bishop in the movie the wild bunch both characters seem like bad people based on the roles they have in society but towards the end both characters end up showing moralistic values such as risking their own lives for another the acting in this movie is unbelievable and it continues to blow me away the direction of the film is great the director martin mcdonagh has made this movie great through his use of dark actionfilled scenes mcdonagh cleverly puts funny comedic relief in the form of the character ray throughout the movie to keep the audience involved in the movie without feeling dreary and depressed he entices the audience with fast action scenes and dramatic scenes that make us question our own sanity through mcdonaghs great characters and casting he has effectively portrayed the overall emotion and conflict of the story line mcdonagh is like the harper lee of directing in that he has made only 1 movie and one short film and seeks to end his filmmaking career this will strengthen mcdonaghs prestige as a director in years to come as he will always be remembered as being a great director besides in the sound department it seems that mcdonagh has completely mastered the art of directing and it is a shame that he will no longer continue his once great legacy,black_comedy
this movie is so good i cant describe it in the english language incredible acting directing and a fantastic dialog its kind of like a tarrantino movie but with a totally different touch to it it has very good depth is very funny and still feel cozy despite the brutality in the movie in the beginning its still and beautiful and the character development is really nice then the heat turns up and the movie goes super exciting and it kind of feels like you are inside the movie im really surprised by this masterpiece wasnt expecting this much of the movie i really hope martin mcdonagh makes more beautiful movies like this one in the future,black_comedy
this is again a film i have seen before and again i took more out of it on a second viewing this one seems to cover all the bases drama romance comedy thrills its got the lot to varying degrees the first time i saw it it was the comedy that stood out this time i was more struck by the drama of it but more of my thoughts later heres a brief summary first summary haters and those that dont wish to know anything about the plot please take a tour of bruges while i write the next paragraphtwo hit men ray and ken have been sent to lie low belgium for those that dont know where it is by their boss harry after a bungled hit they check into their hotel only to find to their dismay that they will be sharing a room this does not go down well but its near christmas and everywhere is fully booked the two men are complete opposites ken is quite cultured and is happy to go sightseeing in the medieval city ray on the other hand is much younger and would be happier spending his time in a bar ken insists they do some culture and ray acts like a bored teenager that is until he discovers a film crew who have a dwarf in the cast he is fascinated with jimmy there he also meets the mysterious chloe who he invites out on a date that evening harry calls and tells ken the real purpose for their visit i will leave my summary here so as not to enrage the spoiler police too muchi think the bruges tourist board will be very happy with this film the medieval architecture comes across beautifully the cinematography is great and the setting adds real atmosphere great performances all round particularly from colin farrell as ray brendan gleeson as ken and ralph fiennes as harry all were excellent honourable mentions also go to clmence posy as chloe and jordan prentice as jimmy both were very goodas i said at the beginning there is a lot of comedy in this film its mainly in the things ray says and does few films make me laugh out loud but this one did in more than a couple of places the drama comes mainly in the final third and i found it didnt quite have the impact it might have done i guess the comedy reduced the force of the dramatic conclusion although by then the comedy is very very dark the ending i felt was a little bit of a letdown i expected something much bigger but over all a very enjoyable film with some laughs excellent cinematography and some great performances recommendedmy score 8110,black_comedy
as usual a great script is the basis for this great film the story turns on a series of highly improbable circumstances which i wont mention to not spoil the enjoyment but the script has managed to flesh out the characters sufficiently well that we even come to expect them or at least regard them as normal in context the camera work is excellent with long static shots of the cityscape and with zooms reserved mostly for people shots so we unconsciously accept how bruges and its medieval architecture becomes a powerful player in the story and the protagonists life and death decisions and actions this is a crime and morality play so i can safely reveal that there is a certain level of violence seem almost arbitrary and meaningless compared to the permanence and therefore emotional force of the constructed landscape against which the action takes place in fact the script acknowledges this several times since the protagonists in several crucial moments actually stop shooting each other to allow themselves to change locales that they think are more appropriate the tower on the main square is the most importance example though at least one scene involves bruges famous canals other normally important actions  theres a great scene with one criminal a dwarf and two prostitutes in a nondescript hotel room  are interrupted or are inconclusive its as if meaningful action can only take place against the backdrop of the citys public places david leans films especially lawrence of arabia and doctor zhivago also tended to transform the environment from simple backdrop into an active protagonist does it in a much more subtle yet strangely effective manner which is perhaps as it should be since the life and death situations in which the protagonists find themselves are all the result of venal morally disgusting and illegal activities the city unbeknown to them works its magic despite that ray one of the killers on the lam describes it as a shithole and brings each of them to their just desserts hell or redemption or perhaps both all in all an extremely wellcrafted film that makes believable the improbable and underscores the futility of individual human action cities are the symbol of the entire community par excellence i havent mentioned the actors but colin farells excesses for once are used to good effect and ralph fiennes and brendan gleason are excellent as usual and the excellent and underplayed script allows the secondary actors to shine as well all in all a great little movie life and death in la makes sense in america but here life and death have strangely little effect or impact since the location makes it such that life or death are almost predestined and thus meaningless as individual destinies,black_comedy
my rating 45 i sometimes wonder what actually makes a movie boring or interesting is it the script story or the pure performance by the actors or is it the overall mood of the movie how come some fast phased action movies are so boring and some slow phased dramas are truly interesting i guess there is no single answer but makes me rethink these thingsis about 2 hit men ray and ken who go in to hiding and waiting for the next big job in belgium at the tourist city of bruges the plot unfolds the emotional difficulties which they have to tackle whilst conquering the differences between themselves in order to be prepared for the upcoming job and a certain regret which starts to drawback ray from everything while ken calls bruges a paradise ray find the city to be boring and uneventful shithall in his own words until he met with some local beauty i wont be telling the rest of the story spoiling the thriller part so dont push me in many ways remind me of the american of course the american was made recently and was earlier so i think the recent movie must have had a mild inspiration there especially the story line including professional hit men and the wonderful sets in the small cities of europe gives me some similarities show some breath taking mid evil architecture quite impressively while giving several background info on them as wellthe most entertaining part of the whole movie is the story yes there are crime and twists but more than that there are feelings pain and emotion which drives it strong when it comes to performance colin farrell ray just melts his character right in to the viewers hearts dont think you will ever get the feeling to forgive an assassin like you would want it to be for rayoverall the movie is quite slow for the first 40 minutes there is nothing much at all other than the two guys roaming the city and talking about their differences but that nicely creates a base for the next half of the movie which has more drama and action sometimes there is sudden unexpected gore which you may not get used to it until the last sceneoverall is a gem in between the monotonous vastly scattered pebblesread more review of mine at wwwflickshoutblogspotcom,black_comedy
i know its been awhile since this came out i actually still remember the first time i saw this i was at my buddies house and were doing a movie day we had already watched funny games and diary of the dead but i really didnt think when we put this in it would be as great as it wascolin farrell who ive been a fan of since harts war shows that he is a great actor in this movie in the first maybe half of the movie its a very dark comedic movie that i thoroughly enjoy but when it finally gets to the serious plot points it doesnt disappoint brendan gleeson along with colin farrell make a great duo with gleesons love of old buildings and tourism and farrells pouting and only wanting to go get drunk at the local pubwith all the quick side stories and adventures i wont waste my time trying to explain some of them and it would also decrease from the pleasure of finding out for yourself movies like this are rare nowadays it seems a movie with slapstick comedy bloody violence and soullets not forget ralph fiennes role you almost want to say he went over the top but he doesnt its almost pitch perfect for the role i smiled whenever he was on screen ive said before that previews are ruining movies lately by giving away to much plot but even if you think thats true with this one trust me your wrong there is so much more to the movie then whats shown in the previewso in conclusion ive tried to not give away any of the plot because this is one of the movies that you should know almost nothing about going in and let the movie take you for a enjoyable ride trust me when the credits start rolling youll be glad you spend your time watching this one,black_comedy
a movie containing gangsters love dark humor and many deaths yet it is beautifully crafted to make all of these aspects fit perfectly martin mcdonagh the writer and director interestingly enough did not start off his screenplay with the plot of two hitmen hiding out after a rookie messes up royally mcdonagh started off with the idea to film something anything discovering that although it may be beautiful to go to which kens character portrays and certainly after watching this movie for the seventh time tonight i definitely want to or it may be the most boring place on earth as rays character portrays colin farrell was absolutely phenomenal in this movie and certainly his best film he himself confessed that it was the best script he has ever read he portrayed his character so well that even though on paper he is a hitman who accidentally kills a little six year old boy you grow to love and sympathize for all of the characters in this film were perfect for their roles and i loved all of them minus the dimdims guy this is definitely not your typical gangster movie and truthfully the first time i watched this i didnt even necessarily view them as gangsters it shows that even the most inhumane of jobs can contain some of the most innocent and confused people and there is something about the ending which i fall in love with every time i watch it it is an ending that is not at all happy but again shows some hope and honor in the world from a dark comedy to a grim end this movie is unique hilarious and very very well done,black_comedy
in brugesyouve got to stick to your principlesdefining the genre of dark comedy presents a cinematic course of continuously entertaining dialogues in a classic clash of humour and drama a story of two hit men ray collin farrell and ken brendan gleeson sent on time off belgium by their boss harry ralph fiennes after a tough job during the few days they spend in the little gloomy town circumstances lead them to show more of their characters and their thoughts on different matters of lifeas you watch you cant help getting pulled right into the plot and what it presents from dramatic reality the key to that is none other than the actual setting of the movie think about this the most preserved medieval town in belgium old buildings and little canals and two irishmen trying to make something of it it all makes the place itself very interesting to the viewer even while collin farrell keeps going at it as being a s hole bruges may not make it to the top the viewers favourite cities list but what makes it very fit for this film is its dull atmosphere and cloudy layout where morning scenes are as dark and gloomy as night ones an essential element for shooting a black comedyevidently the strongest most significant factor that makes an anything but ordinary kind of film is its oscar nominated screenplay a rich flow of dialogues and random conversations so irrelevant and so inappropriate sometimes that it daringly shows the awkward reality of different life situations usually acted out differently in the movies this appears clearly in what i consider one of the most enjoyable phone conversations ever acted on the big screen its harry fiennes vs ken gleeson talking about bruges and how ray farrell feels about it even the excessive swearing and the use of the f word 126 times throughout the film help darken the dialogues and perfecting them for one of the most inspirational black comedies in the history of the genrebut theres always something special about any movie thats written and directed by the same person when you take a closer look at you figure that martin mcdonagh has shown pure brilliance in directing his very own tight script having created the story himself his presentation constantly gives a hint of pure originality in every scene the dramatic depth of is only deepened even more by what i believe to be the perfect cast its one of those rare movies where you think the writer thought of the actor even before the character itself was written farrell gleeson and fiennes each an acting phenomenon on his own fill in their roles in a quite convincing manner good enough to earn collin farrell a golden globe in 2008in a nutshell is one deep sophisticated yet simple story full of morals and symbols it is funny it is dark and it is fully entertaining the piano score the medieval city and the awkward conversations all make it quite the ride the kind of ride you dont miss,black_comedy
when i first heard of this i thought it was just another typical black comedy with some action so never really cared to see it but when it came on tv a few years later i decided to watch it and was much surprised and shockedall the characters were brilliant with the actors all perfectly picked for there roles such as colin farrells huffy raybrendon gleesons sightseeing ken and ralph fiennes hot headed harrythe comedy is great and has many laugh at loud moments and plenty of action so you dont get bored of talkingshould be watched by everyone once though if you dont like constant swearing then beware,black_comedy
i had heard a little about this film when it was out in cinemas certainly the leading actor so i was quite keen to give it a try when i had the chance to see it basically irish hit men ray golden globe winning colin farrell and ken bafta and golden globe nominated brendan gleeson are sent by londoner and mobster harry waters ralph fiennes to lie low after a job in a london church went wrong ray was supposed to kill the priest of the church for a hit and he accidentally kills a child with the same bullet and he has had nightmares about it since they have been sent to lie low belgium during the christmas holiday and while ray is bored and missing home ken is wanting to enjoy the things to do and see ray has his bored attitude changed when he meets drug dealing crook chlo villette clmence posy who is dealing during a movie being filmed starring american dwarf actor jimmy american pie presents the naked miles jordan prentice harry calls with instructions for their hit but ken refuses forcing the mobster to come to bruges to settle the score and have a showdown in the belgian square in the area in the end after seeing ken fall to his death and speak his last words and a gun to give him ray kills harry and once again unintentionally a small person jimmy also starring jrmie renier as eirik elizabeth berrington as natalie and eric godon as yuri farrell with his unusually large eye brows and gleeson with his irish prowess and the always reliable fiennes putting on a lighter than usual voice make a good cast it may be a little politically incorrect in parts it even shocks you with the death of the child but some humorous moments and a witty script it does do well as a black comedy drama it was nominated the oscar for best writing screenplay written directly for the screen it won the bafta for best original screenplay and it was nominated for best editing and outstanding british film and it was nominated the golden globe for best motion picture  comedy or musical very good,black_comedy
over the years the genre of dark comedy has provided some of funniest films and television around from dr strangelove pulp fiction family guy south park etc can easily be classified as excellent addition to the genreray colin farrell and ken brendan gleeson are to two hit men who are sent to the city of bruges after a hit goes badly wrong they are meant to prose as tourists as their await for instructions from their boss harry ralph fiennes they do this despite ray hating the city but he finds someone for entertainment in the form of chlo clmence posy ray attempts to seduce the young woman and ends up going through a number of bouts of violence in the process but in the midst of the fun and games ken is given an impossible choice by harry whilst in the city which if he doesnt do it his life is forfeitis the first film from martin mcdonagh who is best known as a playwright in ireland but well he has a talent as a director and screenwriter is funny throughout and whilst it does edge towards being offensive at times mcdonagh uses this to his advantages mcdonagh writes an excellent script with great witty dialogue funny jokes a bit of violence slapstick and a simple but effective and believable story his talent as a director also is shown allowing for comedy and violence but also there are moments of real drama darkness and character development there is an event that couldnt be done in a hollywood and mcdonagh does shock the audience with it mcdonaghs pacing is quick and for a first time director he has some excellent shots from funny fight scenes to a more touching small moment with colin farrell lying in bed and cries out a single tearthere is an excellent cast in the film colin farrell before this film had a reputation as a bad boy and his acting career seemed to be on the slide to poor action and indie films but with he was able to bounce back and proved that he is a talented actor having excellent comedic timing and able to show he can also be a serious actor with his role this is the best film he has ever done ralph fiennes was very funny and effective as the foulmouth cockney gangster with a short temper this is a very different role for the man and excellent in the film brendan gleeson too was very good in the film and with colin farrell a very funny double clmence posys role wasnt as developed as the other characters but she was decent jordan prentice was very funny as a bigoted dwarf american actor making a film in the citybasically an outrageously funny film throughout,black_comedy
i started to watch this movie with a little big expectations the rating on imdb was so high and movie isnt hollywood cinema hit so i assumed that this must be really god stuff usually when i have big expectations i often get disappointed but not this time i dont like collin farell as a actor much but that not turn me down for watching movie in this title he is really convincing and giving his effort to the top and i had to say that after this movie i have bigger respect for him this is a story of a two friend who are arriving in belgium medieval city bruges to ray which playing by farell is not very impressed with city and he thinks that is boring so he often spending time at pubs suddenly he meet a goodlooking girl and he get heated for her but he doesnt know that his friend ken must kill him for his sin from the past this is not movie which is build on action its slowly paced movie which is main component an atmosphere atmosphere is what movie giving a special feeling connected with really great music with piano on my opinion it deserve an oscar for music theme this is story of man who is persecuted by the demons of his past by the committed crime for which complains deeply because he meet the woman of his life he suddenly begin to be aware of his sins maybe i shouldnt recommend this to fans of fast paced action because it isnt this is an interesting movie with great atmosphere and well acted performance if you like that go and see this movie you wont regret it,black_comedy
i never actually knew who martin mcdonagh the famous irish playwright was before i watched this movieand i wondered more as i watched specially that the movie is well crafted on all aspects  acting directing writing camera motionit seemed it belonged to someone experienced as its so original and on a high level of creativenessprobably not so many films were made in the city of bruges one of the most beautiful cities ive ever seen in a movie the idea of choosing bruges a city thats unknown for a lot of people is brilliant itself as bruges is the main character its also so beautiful calm and mysteriousthe story of the movie revolves around ray and ken two hit men who hide after an almost successful job ray on his first job does something horrible makes him feel guilty which leads him think of death whats after life heaven hell and purgatory he wonders if these things really exist and discusses that with kenken is in some sort of a dilemma when the boss harry asks him to kill ray because of what he has done ken has a strong relationship with harry and on the other hand he believes that ray deserves a second chance and might become a better person also harry the boss killed the guy who murdered kens wife the wife that ken truly lovedthe whole idea of the strong bonds between the characters no matter how are they vicious murderers might not be so original but the originality here lies in the amount of sacrifice and the strong beliefs each of them carry it also highlights how beliefs and values could be crucial at times and the paradox in how those murderers can die for the sake of values and beliefsthe movie discusses through the characters how the decisions people take can affect their lives and the way things get complicated because of what they believe in ken believes that ray deserves a second chance while harry thinks that he should be killed for what hes done the main character here which is bruges declares an end for this struggle having them all killedwere left to wonder if ray is actually dead or not martin mcdonaghs theatrical sense covered the movie gently with sardonicism  showing every race with significant trait or behavior the americans through out the movie are shown as kind of a funny stupid charactersthe fat family  the dwarf the irish characters themselves are so arrogant the people of belgium were so strict and cold the jewish character yuri is shown with the dumb dumb bullets  the uzithe camera had the same sense too displaying bruges with all of its mystery and darkness as they walked in the streets also  the shot were the dwarf was talking about the war between the blacks and the whites the camera shows us the 2 prostitutes which one of them was african and the other was a european blond and the two of them doing drugs next to each other the other scene in which a dog looks in contempt to rey because of what he has donerey running while bleeding to the location of the dream sequence  meeting people with freaky masks as an indication of him going to hellthe dialogue is also remarkable we discover a lot of how these two people view life mcdonagh made the dialogue so simple and yet deep so spontaneous and funny as the characters are talking it was well employed to serve the movie mcdonagh never drifted in long or useless chitchat no matter how tempting it was to do that each character had its highly significant style of talking even secondary characters which reminds us of quentins style in dialogues in an interview mcdonagh said that it had some influence from tarantinos style but he said that he decided to take it somewhere deeperyou cant talk about all of this and neglect the awesome soundtrack by carter burwell the movie might have been a little less brilliant if it wasnt for burwells music throughout the film we find the music describing feelings of guilt sadnessfear and the intimidating beauty of the city of bruges burwell was there and ready for the shift when the scenes got more fast and were full of action in the chase scene between ray and harrymcdonagh is a great movie director who for some reason his work in theater seems to be smoother than film making although he said he always wanted to become a movie director we need to see more of his works the coming years or ill go crazy the movie is simply captivating the same way the city of bruges is inreality and in the movie that non of the characters came out of there and so did i,black_comedy
voila as adjectives and i probably forgot to describe this trip to bruges for even if this is not the first time it shows us that the killers are not only machines but also have feelings here the angle chosen to tell the story of these two killers out completely because of the ordinary indeed already begin interpreting the duo ray colin farrell  ken brendan gleeson works well and both players have very good chemistry as is also too rare and what is cast the supporting actors are all so well written and not allow for accounts such as jimmy jordan prentice who has a key role in the denouement of the plot in fact each character is here to advance the story no one is left behind at the plot or set listed regarding dialogs tasty ralph fiennes and his foul language is an important effect on this the relationship between ray and ken to return to the duo gave me the impression of a father  son and it is felt more gradually as the plot or advance ken knew very well evil that eats ray wants this trip to change his ideas to start and then eventually the cure of that evil in his own risk as a father to his son a city of fairy tale to include ralph fiennes in a moment of the film with this story of impossible love between ray and chloe with her hero ken loan has defied any danger to nothing happens to his protg ray and this gallery of colorful characters have said that this city was ideal because it is indeed a modern fairy tale that we are witnessing i would add that sometimes it is very difficult to keep from shedding a tear,black_comedy
really well written with interesting characters and off beat humor  some flashes of brutality and violence but for those that like quirky films with strong acting  try out written and directed by a terrific playwright  the film takes its time with the two main leads  hit men hiding out after a job goes badly instead of one dimensional killers  the film shows them to be three dimensional with fears and guilt and hope and decency and love  just like anybody gleeson is a wonderful character actor and gives a tremendous performance here  farrell is also a pleasant surprise  when he is usually put into the leading man roles i find him rather boring but hes powerful here as the naive jump first think later criminal and ralph fiennes is a delight as the short tempered crime boss i can see how this film wouldnt be for everyone  but for a crime comedy it is very well done,black_comedy
this film features characters and a plot which one would normally expect to be located in the east end of london or if it was about gangsters hiding out in a continental city one would expect it to be amsterdam but no its bruges the plot may seem relatively simple but there are a lot of deeper meanings in the film in the imagery of bosch paintings and references to religious relics bruges is a city well worth visiting which i have been to a couple of times before but for me the city will never be the same again after seeing this film the film is an 18 certificate and one can see why kids who may want to see it because it features four moonlighters from the harry potter films should not be allowed to there is a lot of swearing in it and the scenes where people get shot are quite grisly there is also one scene which is not for people who suffer from vertigo very good and clemence poesy also looks hot in a slip,black_comedy
2008 is director martin mcdonaghs feature debut and it promises excellent things to come his film shows the influence of guy ritchies lock stock and two smoking barrels 1998 and snatch 2000 but is mostly without the excessive stylisation of ritchies films for two hours the film delicately blends black comedy and action exploring difficult themes of life and death but in a manner entirely without pretension mcdonaghs highlyquotable screenplay theyre filming midgets despite an overreliance on obscenities enjoyed an oscar nomination but otherwise the film escaped most official recognitionafter an assassination attempt goes wrong two london hitmen take shelter in the unfamiliar belgian city of bruges while the philosophical ken brendan gleeson takes an interest in the citys historical architecture the impatient ray colin farrell takes to complaining at every possible opportunity eventually the unique history and people of bruges  including stunning local girl chloe clmence posy and an american midget actor jordan prentice  leads both men to reevaluate their lives for better or worse when specific orders are ultimately disobeyed their disgruntled boss harry ralph fiennes reluctantly flies to bruges to settle matters himself contains several scenes that dont quite work the midgets narcoticsfuelled rant about interracial warfare feels like forced drug humour and the climax seems to operate out of ironic obligation rather than an understanding of character however gleeson and farrell share a chemistry that is amusing and often quite moving the city of bruges whatever ray has to say about it is photographed with fondness and affection depicted as a sort of historical sanctuary where time stands still two friends of mine plan on touring europe later next year their proposed itinerary includes the staple capital cities of berlin amsterdam and paris may indeed have added an additional pitstop to their journey,black_comedy
this movie is the best movie i have ever watched period i have watched it so many times and i still like it my reasons are the following1 the story is genius 2 the jokes are very witty yet subtle most of the time 3 the cast fit their characters perfectly 4 the setting is beautiful it shows how cool old european cities like bruges actually are might inspire some british people to see other european countries than spain when they go on holiday 5 it has a dwarf in it 6 the dwarf is not like any other dwarfs in movies 7 ralph fiennes 8 the portrayal of american tourists which was not too far fetched people who watch dubbed versions of this or a subtitled version wont and say its crap or people who are confused and angry because they didnt get it shouldnt be allowed to vote or submit comments and thus make people who are not sure miss this gem,black_comedy
every budding film maker seems to cut his feature teeth on a hit man movie in fact ive always thought hit man movies should be in their own genre instead they fall into the actionadventure categorypronounced like the sled luge is its own kind of hit man movie it breaks new ground in much the same way pulp fiction and the professional did but while pulp fiction is about cartoon characters who love to act cool and hear themselves talk can you tell im not a tarantino fan and the professional relies on the lolita effect and blatant sentimentality for its characterization it still worked for me is filled with real humanity and real drama it takes very very few cheap shots and those it does take seem to be the film maker winking at classic cinematic conventionsthis doesnt mean the story is completely free of plot devices and such there are mcguffins and other devices in all hit man movies in pulp fiction it was the briefcase in the professional the plant to name just two i wont give away the device in but youll know it immediately when you see itthe two main characters played by colin farrell and brendan gleeson the hit men are not meant to be likable but we empathize with them because of each ones emotional struggle i like this about the movie bad characters doing bad things and yet we feel for them because of what theyre going through however not all the characters have the same emotional wallop the two female characters arent as deep and one of them chloe isnt the least bit likable to this viewer also the character harry played by ralph fiennes suffers slightly from a lack of screen timei guessed the final resolution about five minutes before it arrived and youll probably see it coming too thats ok you dont have to be entirely surprised by this movie to appreciate itlastly im glad the writerdirector edited out the scenes on the disk labeled deleted scenes the movie was much better leaving the audience to fill in the blanks on the individual back stories,black_comedy
two hitmen arrive belgium after a hit that went badhiding out in a town that isnt the most liveliest there way of life is called into questioningcolin farrell is an actor that i didnt pay attention to very much until i saw him in miami vice and since then ive seen interviews were he seems to exude a charming and interesting personality and here displays his acting skill once againi found the film to be quite slow at first but then you begin to fall for its dreary charm and realise its quite funny i thought the casting was done brilliantly bringing in brendan gleeson colin farrell and ralph fiennes each adds something unique and wonderfulthe little town gives the film a darker tone which makes it a fairy tale as ken would saybrendan gleeson plays the hitman with a taste for the finer things in life  beautifully giving the hitman character a warmth while colin brigs a nervousness having to battle his emotions constantlyralph finnes is simply dazzling as the real ard cockney gangsteri kind of figured out the ending when harry mentioned what he would do himself if he ever took the life of a childall in all an film with amazing acting script writing and comedy,black_comedy
this movie is beautifully shot and beautifully cast i was extremely impressed from start to finish i believe this is the first role of colin farrells that i enjoyed and felt moved by ralph fiennes is always surprising and edges more and more into my list of favorite actors the guy who plays ken is barely threedimensional he seems very normal compared to the other charactersthe film as you know is set in the small dutch town of bruges its an old medieval tourist town that is seemingly unimpressive to the common person at first glancebruges serves as a sort of purgatory for the two protagonists of the film they are informed to lay low and to wait for a call from their employer the two main characters spend their time exploring the town to pass time they dont anticipate the danger is right around the corner their employer being extremely disappointed in their last jobthis small town in the middle of nowhere turns into a battlefield some gladiators battling for honor  some for survivallots of laughs but dont let the comedic aspect overshadow the dark and real subject matter that looms over the two characters there are many serious themes that are brought very realistically to the screen regret atonement depression suicide honor killingoh yeah and theres a midget score 910,black_comedy
this was martin mcdonaghs first full fledged movie as a director but nowhere in the movie you will find the novice touch is of the crime comedysatire genre which tarantino guy ritchie etc have excelled in the story is about two british hit men ray colin farrell and ken brendan gleeson who after successfully completing a job in london are sent to bruges belgium by their boss harry waters ralph fiennes until the matter as well as the hit men cool down bruges is a tourist destination of sorts for history lovers because it is a well preserved medieval town but like many european towns it is very dull and slow for a young fun loving person which ray is he hates the place and curses it to the core wanting to leave it asap on the other hand ken loves the feel of the place and considers it a fairytale town and intends to live there until their boss calls they meet some people there namely a dwarfmidget american actor a local drug dealer girl etc who make their life in the place interesting after a while ken gets to know from his boss the exact reason why they are and the movie takes a different turn altogether the plot is very engaging and the dialogues very witty and filled with satire you never get bored during the course of the movie the movie has many references to americans canadians belgians englishmen vietnamese blacks and even pakistanis with a tone of racism but it is not on the face racist comments like in american history x it is well capsuled in the garb of satirei have watched very few colin farrell movies and this surely was his best performance he has many shades to his character he is fun loving aggressive sometimes even filled with guilt because of his small boy killing mistake in his first assignment brendan gleeson plays a matured role and his conversations with both farrell and fiennes are engrossing ralph fiennes ruled the screen in his short but effective role a special mention to the bruges local drug dealer girl and farrells love interest in the movie she had one of the best smiles i have seen a great watch and i recommend itrating  810,black_comedy
from the entrance of carter burwells brilliant score up to the last names of initial credits that is how i felt  enthralledthis brilliantly written film stirs some pondering on life death and judgment it is also sprinkled with some clever and occasionally hilarious dialog the hotel scene in the end was just classic colin farrells character had one of the most likable personalities sure he has no tact but you find yourself chuckling instead of being offended i dont think ive ever found myself this hard at racist banterthe shots were gorgeous im sure im not the only one wanting to visit bruges now the editing was excellent too the pacing was just perfect i barely felt 107 minutes go by no scene got left my mind wandering not once did i feel like checking my watchfinally the ending it was just brilliant i felt like crying i didnt but i actually wanted to the way the story went full circle was reminiscent of polanskis chinatown in fact it might have made the same impact i found myself not wanting to watch any tv or play any music for a few minutes after the movie ended i just wanted to absorb everything i had just seenit was like a fairy tale,black_comedy
ken brendan gleeson and ray colin farrell are hit men their boss harry ralph fiennes instructs them to travel to bruges and await further instructions while hiding out in the medieval town since ray has made a terrible lifechanging mistake on the job is listed virtually everywhere as comedy but a slightlymorethansuperficial viewer might have something to say about that in fact the film is actually a complex fresco of slapstick comedy intense mob drama gothic phantasmagoria and to top it all off grotesque extravaganza what makes this film so unique and superb is an apparently unlikely combination of genres in one unfathomable original hilarious and outrageous script wrongfully devoid of an oscar most of the time you forget that ken and ray are irish mobsters rather accidental tourists and farrell plus gleeson plus fiennes equals comedic virtuosity colin farrell graces us with the best performance of his entire career full of immeasurable depth and versatility while brendan gleeson watches over him with paternal warmth and veteran excellence ralph fiennes rounds out the main cast as a foulmouthed shamefully funny and overly memorable mobboss thus proving his exquisite range as an actor there is one member of the cast who is not mentioned as such but nevertheless acquires fundamental importance that is of course the town of bruges exuding its ancient history from every inch of the screen and wrapped in eigil brylds marvellous cinematography which gives it an aura of mysticism and mystery seldom achieved in films carter burwells fullbodied and profound score underlines the dramatic aspects of the story which crawl almost unnoticed during the first part of the film only to explode with violent and bloody vigour in the second one and culminate into a suspenseful finale overall this subtle operation is not a dish for the weakhearted or the intellectually obtuse as it conjures up an emotional journey which requires full involvement suspension of disbelief and most importantly intellectual openness a trait rarely found in contemporary audiences,black_comedy
i am always on the lookout for true originals its such a pity they so seldom happen eraserhead duel and the night of the hunter evoke the pleasure of something so completely different that it is easy to see why so much art house cinema is such a crashing bore dont get me wrong i will always regard the work of angelopoulos bergman and satyajit ray as absolutely supreme but there are so many lesser artists with so very little to say that one thirsts for entertainment that is not just mediocre timepassing but stimulates through courting the wholly unexpected i discovered a wonderful example the other week and have to confess to being drawn to it a half dozen times since so much so that i find myself beginning to quote lines in the same way that i do from the third man love and death and the discreet charm of the bourgeoisie is a stunner i wont begin to outline the plot as this has been done so many times elsewhere rather will i just say that i adore the characters of the two irish hit men and can only admire the way that the director has made a star of a city in as integral a way as any since carol reeds vienna to cap it all i love the dramatic irony of a scene towards the end involving size and coincidence that it would be wrong to give away but which clarifies so perfectly much that is chaotic on a first viewing resulting in a black comedy of extreme intelligence as well as one of enormous entertainment value,black_comedy
two hit men travel to bruges after a botched hit ken the older more mature hitman sees this as an opportunity to visit the beautiful medieval city and all its cultural artifacts ray the young hitman is going crazy and cant wait to get back to the real world but they cant movie until they get a call from their boss the mysterious harrythis simple premise provides martin mcdonagh the room to create a blend of comedy and drama involving a drugtaking dwarf obnoxious turists a neonazi and his girlfriend who rob turists prostitutes bosch imagery and the beautiful city of bruges through all the dark humor emerges a captivating movie about the importance of principles the ability to change sacrifice regret and responsibility quite a tall order for a hitman movie but mcdonagh pulls it off with delicacy and excitementi dont remember a dull moment in the movie one that didnt have something to hold the viewers attention whether it be the witty dialogue the slapstick humor or just the shots of brugesmuch of the films quality comes from its oscarnominated screenplay but the three main characters each contributed a good deal to the wonder colin farrell reveals some talent for humor and even drama when need be ralph fiennes continues to reward viewers with his intense performances but the real star the actor who should have won the oscar for best supporting role last year but wasnt even nominated was brendan gleeson i havent seen him in such a complex and promising role since the general and its obvious the role excited him because he gave one of his best performances ever playing a middleaged hitman fed up with death trying to do some good for people at last even if it costs him lifei gave this movie the pass when it came out and much regret it has caused me after watching it on dvd there can never be enough movies like this,black_comedy
youve got to stick to your principles says harry and hed die for them and hed kill for them ray broke the rule and he has to die and where else to let him die than at the fairytale town called bruges a well preserved medieval city where everybody has to have a nice time as it is everybodys thing and who else to kill ray than his partner ken this academy nominated movie which gave milk a run for the money in the original screenplay category is an enticing experience of life and death struggle with british patented dark comic proportions and a hidden emotional rollercoaster in all the dialogue between ken and ray is downright outrageous and mind blowing ray colin farell hates bruges brugge in belgium even before he steps his foot out of the train while ken brendan gleeson absolutely loves it ray ventures out feeling bored we meet an assort of characters in the form of locals eerik and yuri canadian american tourists violent medieval art pieces canals with boats an american dwarf actor dutch prostitutes and chloe clemence poesy a girl who sells drugs on film sets she gives him a respite from his dark haunting past which eventually comes chasing him down in the form of harry ralph fiennes a boss of his and kens when the latter not only failed to kill ray but also prevented him from committing suicide though not suitable for all ages due to explicit content regarding language drug abuse racism it is an intense movie veiled by witty but dark humor fantastic dialogue beautiful locations must see,black_comedy

the movie is mainly a black comedy quite british has very witty dialogs to and fro and a few twists as well set in the wonderfully preserved medioeval city of bruges its also an intriguing mix well executed of situational humor and existential dread and gets also to balance light and dark is undoubtedly clever as well as properly acted and written i had the impression it didnt quite know how to end after its best scene more or less in the middle of the movie in my opinion its certainly to recommend for this look into how criminals personal codes of honor and ethics get in the way of their jobs plus its original location adds surely something more to the story although this peculiar genre has already been populated with other good examples of funny and storytelling,black_comedy
this movie was wonderful very twisted a little gory quite surreal in spots but marvelous nonetheless brendan gleesons quiet nobility as a hitman was sublime gleeson was a great foil and it was also great to see ralph fiennes play a mushmouthed hood im used to seeing him in films like the constant gardener or the english patient this departure from those roles had me grinning from ear to ear as i watchedcolin farrell though was truly magnificent he played his role to the hilt his childish affectations and facial expressions were such a treat regardless of how dark this film was i laughed out loud many timesthe supporting cast were all excellent and the city of bruges was a beautiful backdrop i give it 45 out of 5 stars and two enthusiastic thumbs up watch this film its delightful,black_comedy
successfully blends comedy drama and some action with very powerful performances by colin farrel ralph fiennes and most of all brendan gleeson most interestingly appears common and accessible at times but when everything seems predictable we are thrown a curveball that gives the movie a certain edge and an ever present blanket of dark comedy that permeates all characters most especially ray played by colin f bruges a medieval city in belgium is presented to us as a blend of old and new its locals and its buildings set the background while the characters upfront stand out like sore thumbs within a fairy tale place as it is often described hidden within the comedy is a very dramatic script that deals with feelings of regret suicide murder and love but that never seems burdensome or hard to watch especially important to the development of the story is the character of brendan gleeson who has come to bruges not knowing it will be a crucial moment in his life a setting that will allow him to reevaluate his values and make decisions that go against all that he has done in the past ken seeks for redemption even when he knows he is already condemned and we see the interesting transformation on the screen despite its crafty mix of comedy and drama falls short as it delivers an ending that overrelies in unnecessary action and unsubstantial dialogue it is the typical case of a story that needs to end but does not know how there is no better example of this that the final scene and the predictable cyclical ending we are given,black_comedy

for those of us who try to avoid johnny depp and angelina jolies hollywood pop corn  explosion megamovies well this was tempting an european movie shot in europe with a good old james bond flavorwe barely have british movies where we live and to tell the truth we didnt know they have a film industry that would not just take the state subsidies and play in a festival to resume the usual nonhollywood movie lifetimewell known actors hiding in the city of bruges playing hit men on the lurk  waiting for directions arguing each other and the ubiquitous romance with a local cute girlfarrells is acting of real life farrell and thats a role that suits him at his best it was such a surprise that the comedy is dark  very dark and not what we use to see these days  what it lacks is a good argumenta little more reflecting the euro life wouldve been a bonus we dont have the chance of seeing much socialist europe with an overvalued currency  excellent health care system and that the stereotype portrayed of americans is a must see a good effort portraying europe from within europe with european sense of  dark  humor and thats it  dont expect much more the screenplay is excellent just hope to see movies like this with more content in the future,black_comedy
this film is a black comedy that is painfully funnythe dialogue is witty clever and downright hilarious a different kind of role for collin farrel which he performs charismatically for my money brendan gleeson steals the show in this film he is both a gentle and warm father figure as well as a hysterical best friend ralph fiennes is very funny as a london gangster a role that he should be playing more ofthe only reason it doesnt get 1010 is because the changes of tone are way too quick and some of the smaller roles disappear when we want to see more of themwhat we have here is one of the darkest comedies ever,black_comedy

i liked it a lot bruges the city is beautiful and a medieval timecapsule full of boats canals cobblestones and pointy buildings as the midget says there gleeson farrell and fiennes are all quite good fiennes is quite funny in a vicious limey way while you find yourself rooting for gleeson despite his dayjob you know its certainly a movie about some rather unpleasant peoplehit men who snort coke kill total strangers in cold blood swear at one another 100 times a day and basically meander thru life the midget is an angry racist the girl is a coke dealing petty thief and of course her bf is a lollipop man who likes holding people up as well he gets blinded for his effortsim not sure if at least some of this is meant to be a spoofthis is the shootoutsome great lines all throughbut it does play like one at least a bityou might wanna check it out if you dont mind some violence a deeply cynical edge and unpleasant people doing nasty things in beautiful backdrop bruges belgiumi liked it and do recommend outta  at least,black_comedy
so im flicking through the pay channels last night and came across this movie just after the credits rolled i see collin farrel and go hey i like that actor i think ill watch i was immediately grabbed by the surreal dialog that goes on this screen play was a work of genius i dont know who martin mcdonagh is but i will be looking for what else he does and see it im not sure how to say it but it has the right mix of drama and comedy that had me staying up until 1am on the week day and i have 4 kids the cast was awesome colin farrel plays the tortured soul of a hit man trying to come to terms with a hit gone bad and hating being brendan gleeson plays the other hit man who loves bruges and wants to tour the town the banter and dialog between the two of them and the town folks had me riveted and laughing for 2 hours then half way through ralph fiennes pops up in the movie ralph fiennes the twists and turns this movie makes blew me away 910 i only did the 9 because i guessed part of the ending 15 minutes before it happened,black_comedy
the story is quite tragic but a lot of the films events are really funny this film manages to be really humorous amidst the backdrop of what is otherwise a very sad plot collin farrell and brendan gleesons performances are first rate but its farrells dialogue and his delivery of it that is truly amusing and for me makes the film along with ralph feinness nasty yet comically likable mob boss worth a mention also are two of the supporting actors clemece poesy as the very pretty chloe and jordan prentice as troubled yet hilarious jimmy tragic plot but with so many humorous characters and occurrences see this film if you like comedy see this film if you like drama and see this film if you like films beutifull,black_comedy
thank god for awards seasons or else low profile yet noteworthy films like would never have made my list of movies to watch i first read about it as one of the top 10 films of 2008 in aboutcom together with all five eventual oscar best picture nominees then in the golden globes both lead actors colin farrell and brendan gleeson netted nominations for best actor in a comedy colin farrell won his first globe here from then on i knew i had to watch thisyou may wonder why i put drama as the genre above instead of comedy like the golden globes did well it is simply because i did not think this was a comedy at all the plot follows two hit men sent to the medieval town of bruges in belgium to hide out after a messy assignment the main conflicts and resolution of the story are hardly a laughing matter very serious issues of guilt and death are tackled here with some very violent scenescertainly there are some really funny episodes and witty lines of dialogue interspersed within that main storyline but for me these ironic scenes and words do not a comedy make even if that were the intention of the writer and director martin mcdonagh of course this i would not really knowthe interaction of farrell and gleeson was flawless they both deserved to be nominated yet the victory of one over the other is debatable farrell played the younger guy ray who carries with him the weight of a tragic miscalculation gleeson is his jaded senior ken who has already learned to find the good in bad situations ralph fiennes adds to the mix with a startling performance as their malevolent boss harry who has a weird misplaced sense of honormore interesting color is added to the film by the various flawed characters the two meet despite the number of these people in the sidelines each one plays an important role in the story and film never loses its focus i have to mention here the very pretty love interest chloe clemence poesy and the midget actor jimmy jordan prentice for putting in some memorable quality screen time and dialoguealthough excellent this may not be a film for everyone the violent scenes can be quite bloody there are several lines that may offend midgets blacks and belgians but i guess that is where most of the black humor lay in addition i appreciated the fact that i watched a copy with good subtitles since the irish brogue can get difficult to understand and like ken i do like the look history and ambiance of bruges and i would like to visit that place sometime in the future,black_comedy
i saw this movie having read good reviews and heard good things about it so initially i was a bit wary of it and didnt want to build it up too much it was one of those films that i wasnt really too keen on seeingbut my only regret now is that i should have seen it soonerthe film is different to what the trailers make out especially the first two thirds but it is swiftly made up for in the final third the script is brilliant and full kudos must go to the writer and director for bringing such a brilliant piece of art to the big screen because art is what it is from the characters to the city of bruges itself and references to the whole film being set in some kind of purgatoryspoilers to follow there is one scene where the characters brilliantly played by brendan gleeson  colin farrell are looking at a picture in an art gallery regarding that strange place in between heaven  hell this picture completely sums up one of the main themes in the piece and is excellently portrayed as a foggy reality at the end of the movie in the back streets of brugesthe story seems relatively simple 2 hit men hiding out in belgium awaiting a phone call from their boss played fantastically well by ralph fiennes just try to get through 2 weeks in the city brendan gleesons character wants to make the most of it and go sightseeing and colins character is just so bored all he wants to do is get drunkit is the first half of the film that makes it really stand out for me not saying that the second half is bad because its not ralph fiennes owns the second half of the film with such forceful acting and brilliant dialogue that it completely changes the scope of the movie the first half is so well written and so brilliantly funny i wasnt laughing at first but after a little bit of getting to know the characters it became virtually hilarious at some pointsbrendan gleeson is one of the most underrated actors we have in the uk and i think that this is one of his best performance aside from maybe gangs of new york and i will always remember the look he had on his face after hed taken a gram of cocaine absolutely hilarious the comedy is very well done and i implore you not to smirk throughout this filmsaying that there is some dark subject matter that is not to everyones taste and it does get pretty violent toward the end but it is predominantly a film about hit men so you have to expect that some people wont necessarily like the ending but i thought it was very apt and made the film a perfect singular entityin summary of the film the acting is top notch with all three main performers outdoing themselves the film is brilliantly conceived and directed the mix of pure comedy  violence has a perfect equilibrium and it has some very memorable characters throughoutso if you wanna see a film involving hit men scams prostitutes fat americans midgets a hot pregnant woman  endless bizarre characters all superbly interweaved into an outstanding film with comedy  violence then i totally recommend this movie an unexpected  oustanding experience 910,black_comedy
after a botched job two london hit men are sent to bruges belgium to lay low for a while unaware of what their evil boss has planned for them a delightful black comedy highlighted by the witty banter between farrell and gleeson the hit men with contrasting interests the two actors work well together and fiennes is hilarious as their quicktempered boss the dramatic elements are somewhat weak and dont mesh very well with the comedy and the last part of the film goes a bit too far with the violence however for the most part this film is quite enjoyable a remarkable feature film debut for mcdonagh who wrote and directed,black_comedy
tells a darkly hilarious story of two hit men who visit bruges to stay in hiding deserves credit for the creativity behind it among other things being a huge fan of black comedy i havent seen anything like it the screenplay is superb and unique the story feels very shakespearean and i wonder whether there is another movie where the dialogue is loaded with such dark humour through dialogue situations and characterization mcdonagh does take the dialogue to quite an extreme side of darkness using themes like pedophilia racism homosexuality and xenophobia but the comic impact isnt lostthe setting is amazing bruges looks amazing its historical quiet seemingly peaceful and mysterious thanks to the remarkable cinematography which allows the town to play a character of its own it definitely makes one want to visit the placeis additionally loaded with colourful characters that include the aforementioned two hit men the main characters a gangster a racist little person who prefers to be as a dwarf a blind conartist a russian arms dealer a pregnant lodger a sexy drug dealer a dutch prostitute and a canadian couple who hate cigarette smoke many of their appearances may sound random but it all comes together beautifully in this filmall the actors do nothing short of a splendid job farrell and gleeson both perform naturally as the killers with conscience their dialogue delivery and comic timing is fantastic colin farrell is in form after a long time though the reason for rays arrival was to escape the consequences of having killed a child ray is portrayed as a childlike character himself and farrell makes him believable and human brendan gleeson is excellent as a fatherbig brotherly figure to ray his reaction to his costars is particularly of note ralph fiennes has played villainous parts before like in schindlers list and that harry potter movie and here he does it wonderfully displaying a flair for comedy thekla reuten is a surprise treat as she is very likable as the hostess clmence posy is charmingis an exceptional witty black comedy that is both entertaining and fascinating its been a long while since i laughed out loud so many times during a movie,black_comedy
personally i found 2008 to be a very underwhelming year for filmmaking three of my favourite directors came up short chris nolan with the dark knight the coens with burn after reading and guy ritchie with rocknrolla and a lot of the currently popular superhero pictures just werent cutting it every new movie i saw seemed to be lacking in witty scripting and most had disappointing endingsfortunately somebody recommended i watch and what a bloody good decision that turned out to bethis film has attracted a lot of flak it seems to polarise critics people who look on the surface just see a couple of hitman types who swear all the time and are throughly unpleasant individuals not at all likable these critics perhaps missed two of the most important aspects of the picture its a dark black comedy in the vein of american psycho and it is incredibly subtle in places so subtle that it really needs a couple of viewings to appreciate the minimalistic approach of the scriptwriting and directionwhat i like most about the experience  and it really is an experience  is the deliberately grey morality demonstrated by everyone in the film how nice people can be rude and indecent and how those supposed to be evil can actually be incredibly tender and caring even if they might be confused about expressing it colin farrell finally comes into his own here demonstrating an incredible emotional range he goes from childlike impatience to arrogant and presumptuous to heartbroken and desolate it would be a tough job for any lead but i was with him all the way veteran actor brendan gleeson has some formidable chops to add as well with the camaraderie and gradual friendshipmentorship he gives to ray being one of the focal points and a definite highlight everyone in this makes their screen time count whether its minutes or mere secondsits an odd story not completely original but certainly offkilter the swearing is necessary as it is in pulp fiction and reservoir dogs that martin mcdonagh both writes and directs allows him to flesh out his script with more emotion because as mentioned its quite minimal and all the better for it it relies on strong delivery and use of body language and facial expression i honestly think you have to see it three or four times to truly appreciate the effectbruges is captured beautifully on film without drawing too much attention to the backdrop it is clear that the location is an intriguing juxtaposition to the moral dilemmas faced by our two protagonists it speaks volumes about the young gun ray that he finds nothing comforting or calming in the serenity of his hiding place ken the wise and weary companion finds peace of mind and a moral clarity it is obvious he had ignored for yearsif you can get your head around the violence its used sparingly but is i felt genuinely shocking and horrific and the strong blunt language you might find not just the best picture of 2008 by some distance but also the sort of drama you want to revisit time and againif you havent yet go and watch its fine work to be sure to be sure,black_comedy

entirely enjoyable and unusual great acting writing and execution not perfect but nearly socolin ferrell gives a particularly convincing performancemy favorite part is the scene near the end when harry agrees to allow ferrells character to try to escape in the canal in order to avoid shooting around the pregnant hotelier the innkeeper says you guys are weird ha haonly reason i dont give it a ten is that it wasnt longeroddly the trailer gave no indication of what a good movie it is just goes to show you never know until you actually watch it,black_comedy
this is an interesting movie and i enjoyed it far more than i thought i would it is extremely bloody especially towards the end so although it has its moments of black humour no one should be under any illusion that this is a light weight comedy its not trailers i saw in the theatre last year i finally watched the film on dvd at home seemed to project as some kind of british farce and like other reviewers here i find the actuality of the movie different to but better than the trailers had suggested im not sure what prompts movie publicists to misrepresent movies because is good enough to stand on its own merit as a black comedy drama suggesting its some kind of light comedy just brings in unsuspecting viewers who will be upset at the bloodwritten and directed by martin mcdonagh the action is set in the unlikely locale of bruges a beautiful medieval town and unesco world heritage site in the north west of belgium part of the irony of course is that this is a movie about hit men set in a place of astonishing beauty and in a nation widely believed whether justly or unjustly is not for me to say to be one of the most boring on earth better known for fine lace and beer bruges itself is one of the movies stars and its architecture provides the backdrop to the violent action this sets it apart from run of the mill hit men movies where we normally see people being wasted in deserted warehouses and on bleak streets here they expire before stunning ancient monuments on pretty cobbled streets or fall to their deaths from popular tourist hauntsray colin farrell plays an irish hit man who has accidentally killed a child the actual target was a priest but while assassinating the priest a bullet went straight through him and into the child that ray hadnt seen boss harry waters ralph fiennes packs him off to bruges to wait while the situation cools down in the care of ken brendan gleeson the moral centre of the film ken is very taken with the culture and beauty of bruges and treats the interlude as an unexpected and rather welcome vacation ray a fish out of water is unimpressed with the culture around him and initially whines that he is bored he hooks up with a local woman chloe and passes the time drinking but we gradually see him disintegrate psychologically as the enormity of his crime sinks in he killed a child can he redeem himself from such a crime in any meaningful way the denouement comes after ken discovers that harrys plans for him go well beyond just being rays minderthe whole cast is excellent this is probably the best work ive ever seen colin farrell do ive never been a fan of his before ralph fiennes gets his teeth into being a baddie and pulls off a passably good cockney accent reviewing this movie prompted me to look at fiennes profile on imdb and the range of characters he can play is just enormous this is an actor who can make voldemort real in the harry potter films who played a gay butler in bernard and doris and a repressed lord in period costume in the duchess and i recall his as the stand out performance from the constant gardener some years backand speaking of harry potter is something of a cast reunion brendan gleeson excellent as ken is one of those actors with a resume which appears to require extra bandwidth gleeson played madeye moody in harry potter and it was also interesting to see clmence poesy again poesy plays chloe  rays love interest  and i last recall her from a harry potter film too she is perfect as small time crook and drug dealer chloe who may or may not eventually help ray redeem himselfa very politically incorrect movie if the very idea of redemption from murder offends then just dont watch it personally i found the writing acting and setting refreshingly original,black_comedy
at least a little bitat times will make you wet your pants youre laughing so hard and at other times it brings you so far into the depressed selfloathing mind of ray that you yourself are as melancholy and irritable as the characteri believe that it is the sudden complexity of the hitman character which is very godfatheresque that makes the film so absolutely irresistible like bruges you go to this film because it is poignant and beautiful but at times gets boring or at least it should be boring i myself was instead captivated by every moment every frame of wow what can i say except that i have memorized the last few words i can think of nothingbecause at least in prison and at least in death you know i wouldnt be in but then like a flash it came to me and i realized  man maybe thats what hell is the entire rest of eternity spent in and i really really hoped i wouldnt die i really really hoped i wouldnt die this character is irish so you can just guess what those dashes are,black_comedy
what a neat compact and thoroughly entertaining little package actually is  a film that never takes itself too seriously but will have you feeling some sort of slap of emotion if youve gone with it by the time the finale has arrived the film is an extremely black comic piece relying on jokes and humour that targets specific ethnicities and types of people but at the same time includes the necessary substance through slyly introducing events and flashbacks confirming why certain characters carry certain hate ridden and confused opinions on their surroundings the film is encouraging in another sense a british director running on british fuelled money directing a debut piece he also wrote and quite clearly using other british cowritersdirectors from recent times as a source of inspirationthe sources for this inspiration range from guy ritichie to simon pegg with an essence of jonathan glazers 2000 gangster outing sexy beast thrown in for good measure and it all pulls through rather nicely interestingly fellow writerdirector martin mcdonagh pays tribute not necessarily directly to these people but certainly acknowledges hes updating and referencing very early on when one of the lead characters stumbles across a film set here he meets a young belgian female production assistant and she exclaims that what were doing here is an homage a pastiche is too stronga word for the project the leads confused reaction might well be the same for some audience members but the girl has nailed it and mcdonagh has nailed it in his own screenplayit is a homage maybe pastiche is too stronga word but it is poignant this exchange happens on a film set mcdonagh has cleverly brandished his two leads irish making it particularly difficult to label them british gangsters of sorts but you know exactly where hes coming from sees two irish hit men hiding out in the belgian city of bruges following a botched job their orders are to wait for a phone call from english mafia boss harry fiennes as he assesses the situation but harry has a dilemma and when he does call his intentions are far more menacing but that would be spoiling the fun the two leads are ken gleeson and ray farrell and their initial time spent there has the film crack its best jokes that are particularly unpc but also sees the script establish several complex emotional pieces of substance to back up the content it appears ray is having a bit of a break down and thus resorts to verbal insults and discrimination as well as adopting a relatively childlike persona best highlighted at his glee at the sight of dwarfs beer and his bemoaning at the sights of historical buildingssince we do not get to know ray prior to his tragedy we cannot compare mentalities beforeafter ken seems to have known ray for a certain amount of time and acts as a foil to ray once all the bickering begins the important thing here is that ken actually replies to rays bickering so all the complaining and unpc comments ray says in belgium probably does not reflect the kind of person he really is if hed been like this even before the event perhaps ken wouldve got sick of always snapping back and mightve let ray just get on with it if ray is an assassin we expect a certain degree of professionalism from him but what we get is a spoilt child performance conflicting archetypes he is indeed referred to as the boy by characters later onrays badgering sees him insult the belgians fat people autistic people and dwarfs but this sort of neurotic behaviour is confirmed when it becomes apparent rays suffering an identity crisis and is branching off into a mindset of guilt and suicidal ideation hence his too sharpa tongue and insults for a long time we share kens viewpoint we are disgusted at rays dialogue and we get to hear first hand of the revelation harry calls up with but the perspective begins to shift quite brilliantly when things become apparent and emotion comes to the forefrontralph fiennes harry waters is introduced brilliantly he carries a don logan persona about him and the same air of menace with the constant badgering and talk of things seemingly innocent and random only off screen down a telephone our first actual look at him in his england home whilst on the phone is a really tasty piece of editing mcdonaghs fast wise talking gangsters are indebted to guy ritchie and his branching off into a fast paced action film that actually has its characters acknowledge the finale is nearing and that this is the shootout nearer the end is more a link to hot fuzz than anything else again the film set location within the film pops up at the end and its no coincidence this is where the fatal blows are played outwhile nobody weeps for the priest ray killed on the job in the flashback and the fact harry has young kids of his own which is quite alarming the film is brutally entertaining and shot in cold bleak and distant colours commending the psychological feelings ray goes through the film begins in a jovial and juvenile manner but were hit with a brick that knocks both us and the film into focus rather than off course which is very refreshing for a change fast witty and quite humbling at times is a winner,black_comedy
i think what impressed me most about this movie is something the actors all say in the one bonus feature of the dvd it captures and expresses the humanity of the characters no matter what they may be or do somehow even in the worst of behavior they are still very real very human very complex flawed and noble simultaneously i really like this film i liked the premise two shady guys from the 20th century on the lam in a perfectly preserved medieval city whose sureness of architectural line and composition stands in stark contrast to their uncertainty and fear and collective guilt the stately orderly beauty of the buildings which sit on the cobble stone streets or border the canal with its swans which wends its way through the heart of the city of bruges and passes under its many small arched bridges create a sense of composure and timelessness a sense of time frozen as in a master painting    the setting of bruges as calm backdrop to these frenzied visitors is quite purposeful for the writerdirector to allow the mood of incongruity to add to the dark humor one doesnt really see the trappings of modernity at all cars and trucks are almost nonexistent and even though the boats have motors you dont hear them it could well be the 14th century what we hear instead is the noise of the invading people whose orderliness is fairly nonexistent the background is still the people in motion an emphasis of the tension within the characters i believe that nothing here is brand new but cleverly adapted by martin mcdonagh from certain works while not a cut and paste of other offerings it borrows heavily from works that are cited either directly or indirectly and most notably the 1970 british film performance which featured a criminal on the lam hiding in a very strange old mansion inhabited by people living a lifestyle very different than the one he knew part of the allure of that film was that strange juxtaposition of personae who seemed from other worlds the other work that borrows from is roegs classic dont look now which featured a childdwarf and the canaled streets and empty facades of the ancient buildings of venice where that movie had a creepiness this one transposes humor and a dark lightness where roeg used the ambiance of venice to create an insecurity for characters and audience the lovely tranquility of bruges serves to calm the viewer even though the on screen characters are running at emotional redline it is also worth noting that the citizens of bruges are portrayed mostly as in neutral noninvolved even when things get out of hand they maintain a calm very much at odds with the adrenalized britishirish protagonists it is most clever how mcdonagh takes us into a movie within a movie while paying homage to the fantasied works of heironymus bosch he suggests that there may a quantity of insanity in the film industry with its fictional depiction of reality and that no one is immune from being part of that distorted sanity who is participating in any way with cinema whether as makers actors or spectators his replication through costuming of bosch figures into the film within film also suggests that every work of art only issues from the mind of a creator fiction given formwhat is well done is mcdonaghs use of language his script sparkles and breathes strongly none of the lines delivered by any of the characters fail to delight he pokes fun at language through his characters use of certain words and phrases such as alcove to mean nooks and crannies a great deal of the likability of this movie for me comes from the script and i might say that i acted preemptively and put on the captioning when i realized that the characters were speaking british english which is far different than american english it helped to see and hear what they were saying the better to not miss the nuances of a well done scriptcast is very good most impressive was brendan gleeson who has a truly wonderful camera presence here fiennes is very very good as gang leader harry water another nod to roegs criminal boss in performance harry flowers while farrell does an admirable job all the way through farrell obviously enjoyed himself on this one there were a couple of times when his facial contortions went places i dont think farrell knew where they were great funrest of cast did what they had to do and did it well lighting mood sound were all supportive and well placed overall a very nice dark comedy and one well worth recommending to others given the beauty of the background scenery i wish i had seen this in a theater not on dvd at home still beautiful on the small screen a bit bloody though not for the squeamish or young children grade 9 stars,black_comedy
i had the chance to see a few years ago one of martin mcdonaghs plays pillowman and came to know one of the more interesting theater authors today is his first feature film and while his path from a controversial and successful author of theater to director reminds david mamet the characters and mood of his film are more related to the world of tarantinohere is the story ken and ray are two irish mob killers who are sent into hiding after having murdered one more innocent victim than necessary as our gangsters have a soul the younger of the two is full of remorse for the collateral victim who happened to be a kid and as the gangsters world has a code of honor the elder of the two is charged with applying the capital punishment to the younger one here comes one of the best scenes i have seen recently on screen with ken with a gun at hand walking in a park towards ray with the intention to kill him and ending by saving his life by preempting his suicide genial  i believe that this scene may win an oscar for original script to martin mcdonaghthe city of bruges is playing more than a background role in the film with its so european order cultural atmosphere and quiet beauty it contrasts at first sight with the brutal characters sent into hiding under the disguise of the world worst tourists and yet it is the simple humanity of the place and civility of its people that ends by engulfing the two heroes and making them find inside themselves the resources of questioning the sense of their own actions the middle of the film takes almost a moralistic and religious tone when dealing with these issues when the brutal world the two belong to surges back under the person of the mafia boss come to fulfill the rules of the crime world code of honor even his actions end by submitting to the ritual of european politeness as in his plays you are never sure whether mcdonagh is ironic or respectful towards the world he describesgood acting helps a well told story which develops in a natural manner despite the quite unusual premises colin farrell an actor that critics love to hate for roles like the ones in alexander or swat is simply marvelous as ray the young gangster hitting hell at his first murder trying to redeem himself and showing that he is so much better than his own actions brendan gleeson as ken the elder wiser and even more culturalprone of the two adds his own human dimension enhanced in a classical gangster movies ending which otherwise looks somehow not fit into the rest of the film ralph fiennes is cast here completely against his type another fine choice of the director and does a wonderful job as the hysterical mafia boss enforcing the code of honor to its ultimate consequences clmence posy provides the romantic trigger igniting the spark of humanity in ray while jordan prentice allows to the director the throwing of ironical arrows towards david lynch and the dwarfhaunted surrealistic dreams in his movieshopefully mcdonagh will continue this path of his career as film director after this remarkable start his own playwriting with the cutedge irony black humor and the sharpness of drawing his characters is probably the best source of inspiration and the best chance for his voice to become fully original away from the other film makers who influenced his beginning,black_comedy
this film walks in its own way and with the exception of one or two alcoves or nooks and crannies it walks along new roads and bywaysi wanted so strongly to give this picture 10 out of 10 but it was spoiled by two very silly and deeply regrettable scenes i say regrettable because they were so foolishly overlooked and so easily fixable that i can never imagine why they were allowed to remain in the finished product one could have been omitted altogether the other re shot very simply the first is the lunatic scene with the so called overweight american tourists this was like a bad moment in screwballs or dumb and dumber and should never have happened at all given that it did happen it would not have harmed the story in any way to have committed it to the canvas bag or to the cutting room floor the second regrettable scene was in the restaurant when for some reason best known to the director the direction takes on an amateur theatrical or painting by numbers technique she exits to go to the ladies room he blows smoke and an arrogant diner complains he snaps it and calls the diner by inviting him to repeat his complaint this leads to an over injection of testosterone on both sides they stand punches are thrown and the hero decks the diner his date then swings a bottle and he decks her the table breaks away as many a card table did in the old westerns and both decked characters remain decked she returns from ladies room right on cuejust in time to clock the situation to this point nobody has stopped eating the waiters are all out the back having a smoke and the restaurant manager has gone for a pee or is taking a shower in the next building because nobody attempts to stop the fight or even pay it the slightest attention in order to avoid any further collapse in the suspension of disbelief the director cuts to exterior night two and the couple out in the street walking away from the restaurant the time that would have been saved by cutting the fat tourist scene could well have been used to support the utterly unbelievable restaurant scenesuch a shame because the film is a beauty and the combined efforts of all concerned in this production have provided the world with a work of nearly true greatnessregards dracher,black_comedy
british gangster film a genre that apart from guy ritchies films and sexy beast has gone pretty much unnoticed for quite some time so what makes martin mcdonaghs feature debut any different from the rest what justifies its status as a really good gangster movie well for starters theres a lot of religious symbolism which fits in nicely with the incessant profanity and occasional bouts of outrageous violence second and this is the real selling point it takes placefor anyone whos never been to the beautiful belgian city the official name is actually brugge since its in the dutchspeaking part of the country mcdonaghs film can serve as a satisfying tour guide despite the consistent complaints from ray colin farrell who calls the place a shthole not that he is there willingly he screwed up an assignment hes a hitman you know and so he and his mentor ken are hiding abroad for a couple of weeks until their boss harry ralph fiennes calls with new instructions and while ken laps up the gorgeous architecture medieval streets and museums ray says that unless he was retarded and had grown up on a farm theres no way bruges could ever impress himthen all of a sudden ray has an epiphany a film set where the main character is a rude midget jordan prentice he bonds with the little fella falls in love with a woman named chloe clmence posy aka fleur delacour from harry potter and the goblet of fire and starts appreciating the town a bit more plus a little cocaine never detracts from the pleasure and just as things are beginning to shape up harry and his instructions show up for a social callthe stark contrast between beauty the landscape and ugliness the language and eventual bloodshed is the key ingredient of weird appeal in fact the two aspects come together when ken and ray are admiring a series of paintings by famous artist hyeronimus bosch and ray just cant take his eyes off the last judgement a splendid yet shocking depiction of the afterlife this is also where the films underlying spiritual theme is unveiled the two protagonists are seeking redemption and bruges is their purgatory although ray has another opinion on the matter this is what hell must be like spending the rest of eternity in fcking bruges it may seem a bit farfetched but then again the characters themselves describe bruges as something out of a fairy tale thus justifying the movies surreal turns not least the fact and its no coincidence that the moviewithinthemovie is inspired by nicolas roegs dont look nowbut the real beauty of doesnt lie in the setting alone whos there is also a crucial element gleeson is as expected a tough but ultimately loving presence and fiennes though ostensibly ripping off ben kingsleys work in sexy beast but hey so did alec baldwin in the cooler especially the language he swears a lot doesnt he says ray adds an extra notch of creepiness to what is fundamentally the villain of the piece of course the main characters are all gangsters so its a pretty strange distinction and then theres colin farrell a revelation in spite of his being in the business for over a decade it was a given that hes a good actor just look at tigerland phone booth or miami vice but the comic and dramatic heights he reaches here with a deeply sad yet endearingly entertaining performance for which he won a deserved golden globe show that hes still got a lot to give and its an impressive lot judging from this filmbottom line is brutal filled with expletives visually irresistible boasts terrific acting and comes with a fascinating religious subtext it may not be everyones cup of tea but any lover of the gangster genre ought to check out an opus so postmodern that it actually has a conversation where one character asks two people to put their guns down and one of the shooters replies dont be stupid this is the shootout,black_comedy
this film is about two london hit men sent by their boss to wait for their next assignmenti was put off by the slow beginning as it meanders around the streets of bruges without an apparent clear focus this situation is completely changed once the cold blooded boss played brilliantly by ralph fiennes appears the story escalates to become a thriller and yet it preserves comedic moments in a clever way without being silly this is hard to achieve but succeeds in making thrilling scenes funny all three leads are great cinematography is nice and the locations are beautiful all these elements combine together to make an appealing film,black_comedy
brilliantly written and shot this dark unpc tale in painfully funny while keeping its unsettling undertones each role is played distinctively well and the character interaction is most entertaining and impressive even farrell who surprised me in several very dramatic scenes the films cinematography captures bruges with excellent scenery while close ups of the characters immerse the viewer a subtle soft piano score follows throughout the film while the suspense scenes offer great orchestration i must agree with many that although gleeson shines with warmth and farrell proves himself worthy of acting fiennes steals the show as the incredibly rude witty and deadly antagonist yes is a vulgar and mean spirited tale but offers a genuine viewing experience for those not squeamish to continual harsh language and bloody action definitely watch this film and take from it what you will,black_comedy
an excellent film extremely subtle and humorous not everyone will like this film its not fast paced or action packed however the acting is exceptional and it is filled with both humor and sober thoughts on life death and guilt colin farrell has undoubtedly offered up his finest performance in film farrell has been decent in other films but this role was filled with humor and vulnerability the acting during a conversation at breakfast with brendan gleeson in the hotel is priceless so too farrells attempt to get a date with the lovely and wonderfully attractive clemence poesy gleeson himself is excellent as well as a brief but very poignant role by ralph fiennes the golden globe nominations of gleeson and farrell for best actor in a musical or comedy were well deserved in my view farrell should get a best actor nomination for the academy it is not a winning role but it is phenomenal acting i doubt hell get a nomination given the academys melodrama fetish however i will guarantee that farrells role is better than two or three of the roles farrell takes small scenes with good dialog and makes it exceptional the various views of bruges are very nice the movie captures very well life in a midsized european town the main square the hotel and its breakfast area all are captured quite well the screenplay is equal to farrells acting there are great statements about life and choices one makes  as well as great humor to be able to explore both with equal aplomb in a film is quite an achievement the screenplay for this movie is also quite deserving of an oscar nomination the one slight negative i would have is that i might have changed around a couple of scenes near the end but thats always the writers prerogative finally the language is pretty rough at times however this seems essential for a legitimate portrayal of the characters unless you can only handle mindless action films dont get me wrong  those have their place or fast action dramas  you should enjoy this movie,black_comedy
i love a good black comedy  miles davis struckmatch black when i say black comedy no im not talking about barbershop or any other rubbish with ice cube in it im talking about comedy that combines the morbid and grotesque in order to convey the absurdity and cruelty of life so when i finally finished watching an advanced copy of the first thing i did was run out onto the street and scream hallebloodylujah to the sky well figuratively finally a decent film here i was thinking that i was going to die without having watched at least two good films this yearfew cultures do black comedy better than the englishirishwriterdirector martin mcdonaghs first fulllength feature film tells the story of two contract killers who are forced to hole up belgium after a recent hit in london goes south waiting on further instruction from their employer the mysterious harry waters ralph fiennes ken brendan gleeson the older seasoned professional and ray colin farrell the younger inexperienced rookie begin to realize how different their perspectives of life death and redemption truly arelet me say straight off the bat that wont be everyones cup of tea but if you love dark british crime films like lock stock chances are you will enjoy this offering from mcdonagh can only be described is a multilayered breath of fresh air its violent its crass its absurd its touching and its as funny as hellrevolves around two men with a unique sense of moral flexibility dumped onto a train and sent to bruges in order to wait it out until the heat dies down from their last job  they have two weeks to wait for a phone call from their boss so how do a couple of hired guns kill time in one of europes most intact medieval cities they go sightseeing of course the film instantly drops us into the interesting dynamic between the two lead characters ken and ray ken wants to get out and experience the culture and atmosphere of the city while ray is the complete opposite content to stay in his hotel room and wallow in selfpity  that is until he meets a young woman on the set of a local film as the story unfolds we learn more about the botched hit in london and as a result we learn more about what motivates our two leads throw a druggedup midget into the mix and our two hit men are set for an intriguing if slightly predictable climaxi couldnt fault a great deal in terms of the acting or characters at first i found it a little difficult to picture brendan gleeson as the seasoned contract killer but any objections quickly fadedaway as the story pickedup likewise with colin farrells character  he did come across as a bit of a sniveling girl not exactly farrells strong suit from an acting standpoint but i soon forgot all about that the instant i became immersed in the story once it became evident that mcdonagh optedout of going with characters that resembled twodimensional cardboard cutouts from your typical hollywood action film the experience washedover me in a satisfying wave i went with the story i went on the journey and i loved itwhy the hell cant hollywood make these sorts of films interesting characters an engaging story touching moments and some wicked black humor there i was less than twenty minutes into the film and cackling my head off at farrells character insulting a group of rather rotund american tourists then it suddenly hit me like a bullet to the forehead i cant remember laughing this hard or this much at any of the films ive reviewed recently combined get smart and hancock maybe resulted in one or two genuine laughs but i was only twenty minutes into and i already had a massive smile on my face the laughs didnt stop there trust medont be worried if the name martin mcdonagh doesnt ring a bell i hadnt heard of the guy before going into this film either having done a little research on the man since it appears that mcdonagh is quite an accomplished playwrightcumfilmmaker who has won more olivier awards for his plays than ive had hot meals i suspect that the directors theatre experience is an integral part as to why is such a great film  theres a sense of intimacy and polish to that is such an important part of playwriting overall i really enjoyed  an absolute breath of fresh air compared to the dreck that comes out of hollywood these days if god did exist and if i actually believed in a god id have to thank him for the dark wit of our european friends in the uk and ireland i only had two small criticisms of the first without giving anything way i must admit that the last fifteen minutes of the film were pretty predictable  but for me i still loved every second of it the second criticism it almost felt like i was watching a belgian tourist commission advertisement for bruges  id almost swear that the director was getting a kickback from the local government to bestow the virtues of bruges and its incredible history only to have that notion tornaway every time collin farrells character mentioned how much of a hole bruges was ultimately neither of those minor niggles detracted from the film as a whole  if you love english black humor then is absolutely worth the trip to the cinema or video

well this is my 1st comment at imdb actually i never did it before coz never saw any good act before the way director represented situation here we cant judge i have seen lot of movies i predicted almost 80 before scene plays but here u cant predict anything u cant judge is this drama or comedy art u juzz follow the movie till end role played by best actors colin played best innocent guy brendan gleeson given as usual best act even we can see the hotel owner preg woman also given excellent dialog delivery like other characters here we cant decide who is good n who is bad everybody is damn right with role an excellent work after long time,black_comedy
really enjoyable and intelligent film involving from the start this is sad funny violent and very non pc for me the ending was a little too protracted and i would have avoided the false ending that was a bit too melodramatic but otherwise a joy to watch and very different baddies competing in their badness but drawing their own lines they would not cross i loved it that a guy could talk of all his kills then get soppy over some aspect of his life but what i liked best was the full frontal script and gags that we thought could no longer be told involving gays americans dwarfs fatties and much much more great stuff i had not seen colin farrell before but was most impressed with his sense of timing and can well understand his popularity not least one sign of which is that i see his has five films slated for release in 2009,black_comedy
what exactly is a quirky crimecomedy in the vein of guy ritchies early films and the slew of imitations which followed a meta deconstruction of the crime genre a characterbased drama laced with plenty of humor martin mcdonagh doesnt want to limit himself to one of those things making if nothing else a film certainly worth seeing and something that promises a future for him as a film writer he is already a well established and acclaimed playwright responsible for the superb leenane trilogy and the closer in tone to in bruge aran islands trilogy yet to be completed while there is nothing bad about mcdonaghs direction its pretty standard modern tv level stuff theres the typical amateur trick of having the camera moving nonstop even when people are just talking although mcdonagh makes the wise decision not to do this whenever our lead romantic pair are onscreen suggesting that he at least had a reason for doing that when the criminals were conversing even though its still an unwelcome distraction and a cheap ploy to keep impatient viewers interested the film never rises above the level of a television series visually in spite of some neat outdoor scenes where the cinematography becomes notably better than it is throughout the rest of the movie where again its pretty standard tvlevel stuff i would have loved to see this script handled by a more mature experienced and better director than mcdonagh although he could improve later in his career for surethe screenplay is not surprisingly a far more consistent and solid affair not everything works and theres a little too much reliance on catchphrases and character quirks which are supposed to make you laugh just by inclusion in fckwas funny oh the first ten times but it gets old as well as too many look how clever this is meta touches are you stupid this is the shootout still the movie is genuinely funny a lot of the time and has a surprising amount of depth with the two main characters particularly colin farrells character ray and farrell is great here which helps hes done this sort of thing before but nothing has given him as much to chew on and hes surprisingly good at the more contemplative stuff the farfetched ending which fits with the tone of the film and the established idea that being is like being in a fairytale is still a costly mistake along with everything leading up to it and ralph fiennes is coasting on his evil routine here with again some meta comedic touches still considering the ambition of the script to make something more out of a genre which has been extremely lightweight for a long time its overall quite successful is not mcdonaghs best work as a writer but hopefully it will open doors for him in the industry and allow more of his dark comedy often featuring some real intelligence and solid character writing to be seen by a wider audience is fresh and involving enough neither as bad and certainly not as tired as its detractors claim it is and probably not quite as good as its fans would tell you worthwhile viewing,black_comedy
this film really astonished me i never really cared much for colin farrell but man did he surprise me in this movie now of course most of the credit goes to brendan gleeson and ralph fiennes as they bring sophistication to this raunchy flick the dialogue i think was the movies strongest point and that just may earn it a well deserved oscar nod the chemistry between gleeson and farrell was remarkable and the introduction of fiennes into the affair is downright brilliant acting wise gleeson gave the best performance of his career while fiennes unleashed his inner beast out reminded me of ben kingsley in sexy beast of course the film is somewhat risqu but ultimately it just works out so well its shame that not too many people saw it because this movies potential is just so amazing alas these little gems are overlooked by the critics but in the heart of the fans the movies brilliance takes center stage with the exception of the dark knight the grand spectacle of 2008 this is the best film ive seen so far this year with oscar season approaching more complex films may come but i will always remember this fairytale set,black_comedy
whats funny about imdb is that the vast majority of the voting and opinions are expressed by males 1628 the vast majority of the bad reviews ive read for this film are based on the basic average american guy whos looking for a cheap thrill i think you need to be older and have a lot of movies under your belt to appreciate a film like this this is one of the best movies ive seen in the last couple years anybody who said this film was boring is either too young to appreciate or too inexperienced from a moviegoing experience to appreciate what the film is the script is fantastic the acting was spot on ive read criticism about the theatrical dialogue hes invoking a little mamet here but its good i liked it i like the relationship between farrell and the honey belgian i laughed my ash off when fiennes is looking over the guns and makes the reference to gang bangers in south central los angeles where im from,black_comedy
is a movie that should have a category unto its own because there are very few movies out there like it that mix brutal violence with such a frivolity in a way it is comparable to say pulp fiction but the reason pulp fiction is sometimes funny is because of the absurdity of its violence combines hard hitting and sometimes heart wrenching violence with lighthearted humor this is something not completely new but definitely something that has not explored widely colin farrell does a terrific job in the film i havent seen in act so well since tigerland in 2000 he plays a naive man named ray lamented by the torment of a past mistake who finds himself stuck in place which is perhaps worse than the hell he has left behind bruges a storybook town in belgium brendan gleeson as ken takes a break from period piece movies and provides a conservative contrast to farrells stark ray then there is harry a crime boss played to perfection by ralph fiennes who in my opinion should earn an academy award nomination for his portrayal in the end is mortality tale and a morality tale wrapped up in an often time hilarious and sometime brutal movie which serves to remind us all that good filmmaking comes first a foremost from a good script,black_comedy
i must start this review by stating that even tough i love the big epic genredefining multimillion dollar all time and all new classics my greatest pleasure in cinema is to stumble upon the little movie not little on budgeteven if it happens to be true many times but a movie that is restrained in scale that has but a few characters and a simple premise a movie that expects nothing of itself but to be what it is in one word simplicityif you read tolstoy you soon realize that in his writing the biggest remarks on human nature are expressed in the most beautifully simplified verse it holds true to all arts that through simplicity and showing nothing more than a detail you get a more accurate display of lifeis such a gem perfect as it is shot in the beautiful city of bruges to which we are introduced by some of the most beautifuland some times hilarious footage i have ever seenone where a dog looks from the window to the street like an old lady burns into the memory fast the acting as it always happens in such small movies is what carries the film great acting all around with the grand prize going to colin farell who seems to be on top form after giving up alcohol a very nuanced performance from a truly great actoroverall this is the most enjoyment i have taken from cinema this year fun layered meaningful and a treat to the eyes810,black_comedy
i really enjoyed this one a terrific comedytragedy that features great performances from its three central players a sharp script and gorgeous location shooting the plot is pretty simple two irish hit men hide out after a job it would be a shame to give away any more plot spoilers because its such a fun ride this is my type of humour and the film is amazing in that one moment it has you laughing your head off then less than 10 seconds later you are struck silent by the emotional depth or poignancy of a single line case in point the scene in the childrens playground firsttime director martin mcdonagh masterfully steers this film around the beautiful city of bruges a setting cleverly juxtaposed with the action farrell hasnt been in such good form for ages and he and gleeson have great acting chemistry together fiennes is also great as the ruthless crime boss who is also a man of principle while the ending is maybe just a little too cute this is still wonderful filmmaking,black_comedy
i went to see this movie with no expectations whatsoever as i hadnt heard much about it in the press and i thought it would be one of those idiotic comedies that are only intended to lace some peoples wallets how wrong i wasfrom the very first line i was hooked the dialogue between farrell and gleeson is hilarious particularly because of the irish wit that makes this movie what it is contains such dark unpc humour and is quite brutal at times but this just adds to the charm of the movie although it is safe to say you will be shocked at some point watching this regardless of how thickskinned you are i am actually surprised they were allowed to release this but so happy they did my only fault with this movie is the ending i wont ruin it as it was rather cruel and some of the scenes involving gunshots are especially revealing and callous the setting is beautiful and the diverse mixture of characters the man in the ticket booth the fat americans and the skinhead exboyfriend to name a few make this a magnificent experience i would say that this film is not for everyone i and everyone i know loved it but if you are easily offended or squirm at the sight of blood then stay away,black_comedy
when was first released i originally didnt pay much attention to it dismissing it in a very stereotypical and naive fashion as an undertheradar boxoffice flop how wrong i wasthe film begins by gradually introducing the films setting and characters ray here played by colin farrell initially has very little idea where or what bruges is or what its culture and traditions entail therefore this helps the audience to identify with his character in that he is struggling to understand his current situation and how to act ken brendan gleeson seems to take the role of mentor at first however as the film progresses so does his relationship with ray finally arriving at a point where they have a mutual friendshipto me this film seemed to be more of an action film sprinkled with dark and comic humour rather than a comedy film with action fitted in the second half of the film seems to reflect the former the tone of the film shifts entirely transforming what was once a rather lighthearted exploration of the city and the characters into a dark relentlesslypaced endgamethe acting from both colin farrell and brendan gleeson is spoton not only settling into their characters well but humanising them farrell plays the role of lovable rogue ray whos busy wrestling with his conscience whilst gleeson portrays a middleaged worldweary hitman whod rather hand in his gun in favour of sightseeing and belgian culture a star turn from ralph fiennes also as a truly intimidating harry watersoverall a very wellwritten and superbly handled piece of filmmaking proving once more that quality movies do not have to include bucketloads of cgi effects and overthetop shootouts and car chases to impress,black_comedy
i finally got to see this movie  ive been wanting to see it since i saw the trailer and now after i saw it id say it was worth it basically two hit men goes to bruges under the order of their boss and they should wait for a call  well not that much to tell  but what a way they tell it besides amazing direction and writing from martin mcdonagh this movie have very good performances from all involved  farrell  gleeson they are one hell of a pair  fiennes as always gives you a new fiennes each movie  and all the rest of this great flick so in conclusion i would thank them all and im looking for more from this guy mcdonagh  ,black_comedy
is a very interesting film and as dull as that term is it truly feels most appropriate writerdirector martin mcdonaghs first feature length film is somewhere between a european crime comedy reminiscent of guy ritchies work and an existential drama sometimes this works and sometimes it honestly becomes schizophrenic a marketing nightmare im not surprised it was released in the offmonth of february as a result the film is an experiment that pays dividends in ways mostly in humor and characters and feels curious and strange in others when it comes to the more dramatic moments as with most experiments its the kind of film that some people wont be able to stand and some will flat out lovethe film starts off as it was marketed as the offbeat euro crime comedy the premise is simply that ray farrell and ken gleeson are hit men and their boss fiennes who doesnt appear until an hour into the film tells them to lay low and await further instructions the city thus plays a vital role in the plot and especially in the films deeper meaning the gentle balance between the humor and the themes of personal inner turmoil is where the film goes schizophrenic the first hour is mostly all lighter and the second is substantially darker the humor exists throughout though it grows darker as the plot doesi found the humor to be the greatest strength of the film each joke is sort of a swift punch in the gut you laugh hard very quickly but it doesnt linger for long the characters were obviously instrumental in this though i felt farrells characters was a bit too all over the place he was really quite excellent at showing his inner monologue whenever mcdonagh had a shot exclusively of him with no actual action or dialogue gleeson is also a terrific supporting actor and brings an interest to ken though hes not the funnier of the two fiennes though his time brief does as he always does in sucking your attention toward him when he plays an antagonist he always steals moments in films and this really isnt an exceptionthe hidden gem of this movie is the notion of bruges as purgatory or perhaps even hell and the way it psychologically affects the characters and their thoughts about life and death how much you like will pretty much depend on how well you make that connection and it resonates with you its easy to get caught up in only the humor of it the film and totally miss all that or in some cases that thematic content simply is too subtle in general i felt that because it set the tone early on as an only minimally dark crime comedy those themes fell short with me so while i think is one of the more interesting films ive seen lately it didnt click with me all the way,black_comedy
it was six months back when i went to bruge and it fascinated me by its beauty  lovely place on bbc when i saw the discussion of this new movie  i found it interesting i saw the trailers and that too appealed me  as is based on an interesting premise two hit men  elderly ken brendan gleeson and young ray collin farrell  are ordered to hide by their boss harry ralph fiennes because ray along with a priest by mistake killed a young boy  and other gangs are behind them to seek revenge the only way the thing can be resolved is to kill ray harry asks ken to kill ray who is suicidally depressed ken wants to give ray another chance harry gets angry and comes to bruges the final showdown results in lots of gunshots blood and death of most of the protagonistthis is a dark comedy thriller movie writerdirector martin mcdonagh who had won an oscar for a short film  six shooter in 2004 comes back with this wonderful movie he has this uncanny style of narrative where he infuses dark comedy and racism slurs  with penache and the style is felt in every frame of this movie even in the darkest and grimmest scene  martin manages to keep audience gay  with the dialogue and style the writing  story  screenplay are the kings and martin takes out brilliant performances from his perfecting castingbrendan as key masterly enacts this role of loyal hitman and a compassionate friend collin farrel is just outstanding in his role of this innocent eccentric dry humored  silly guy  who is also a cold blooded murderer with a conscious ralph fiennes  since shakespeare in love has grown in stature and maturity in his characterization of rolesthe musical score is carter burwell and cinematography of bruges by eigil bryld are excellentthere are also other characters in the film who are real to the groove and have given top class performancesthough comparable with tarantino dark humor and style i think martin has his own genre of telling the story i hope he continues giving us such lovely and enjoyable gemsthose audience who do not like talkative movies or movies that show blood in cold shots  stay away from it others go and enjoy this wonderful flickjust a trivia i went to see this movie with my work colleague claudia misch and met other two colleagues  lena and guido all four sat together and enjoyed seeing this moviestars 725 out of 10,black_comedy
i thought was a breath of fresh air in what has been a stale year for my taste in movies first i was surprised by the depth of character colin farrell displayed it was i thought a touching performance laced with nuance and intensity the great brendan gleeson played the wise foil to farrells brash and ignorant thug with aplomb the real star was martin mcdonagh with a great script and subtle direction ralph fiennes reminded me of ben kingsley in sexy beast relishing his menace all in all the dark humor was top notch i will be watching for more martin mcdonagh films and i highly recommend this one as a place to startrick,black_comedy
just when i was seriously lamenting the lack of any originality in filmmaking in the past few months along comes to prove me dead wrong and im glad for it wonderfully impossible to classify it ranks right up there with the best of the coen brothers blackly funny crime romps like fargo blood simple and the big lebowski yet swirls in the best parts of guy ritchies geezer films as well with just a dash of existential angst for flavor mature sanguine ray harry potters brendan gleeson and his hotheaded yet softhearted protg ken a fantastic colin farrell have been ordered by their boss to spend a few days cooling their heels in the picturesque medieval city of bruges in belgium after an assignment they were taking care of backfires in a completely horrific way oh did i happen to mention that the two buddies are hit men and that its kens actions that fouled up their latest jobthe two mens polar opposite reactions to this quaint european city tell so much about the characters and both actors take every opportunity theyve been given and run with it gleeson whos done everything from horror 28 days later to comedy the snapper to a combination of both lake placid shines here as the seasoned vet and farrell whos had a real tough time picking projects that make the most of his considerable talent has never been better against this postcardready backdrop like a rumpled modernday answer to rosencrantz and guildenstern ray and ken ponder the ironic finality of death the perplexing puzzle of life and what their part in it really is and how anyone could or could not spend their lives living in fing bruges while they wait to hear from harry their boss the excellent ralph fiennes who doesnt show up until halfway in but blows us away when he does they while away the time sightseeing and sampling the local beer a movie shoot taking place in the town square figures prominently as the movie pokes fun at itself with wry and refreshing selfawareness a beautiful local girl named chloe clemence poesy and a dwarf named jimmy jordan prentice both connected in their own way to the moviewithinthemovie figure prominently in the events that occur later that affect both men in a way that both shatters and surprisesirish playwright martin mcdonagh wears both writer and director hats here for the first time and both fit him like a glove the dialogue is very realistic with just enough whimsy to delight the audience and define the characters without being too clever or precious about it and the dark bitter ending offsets the movies earlier sweetness just rightsort of like really good belgian chocolate like the kind im sure you can getkudos to everyone involved for producing a marvelous piece that feels independent but not contrived,black_comedy
a rather ironic film mixing crime with morals the first half is rather slow that you start wondering what the fuss is all about but the last twentysomething minutes is a really rewarding finish to this quite thoughtprovoking film colin farrell plays a hitman who is bothered by guilt because of the serious fuckup he commits on his first assignment he is sent to bruges together with a colleague to initially lie low for a while as the plot unfolds and the real reason why they are is uncovered the story thickens as the audience begins to sympathize with the unusual leads this film presents the much debated upon idea that no one is either purely good or just downright evil it proves in very unlikely ways that even criminals have hearts and even the worst kind of people can be honorable it is a very simple story that is worth a viewing and i guarantee that it wont leave your head even long after the credits are overhttpiwascalledclementinemultiplycomreviews,black_comedy
so i watched last night from the very opening of the film colin farrells voice over informs us hes a hitman now this bit of information didnt turn me off the story but a part of me wondered just how much more this film could offer to the many hitman parodieswell after viewing the entire film im not sure if added anything expediential new to the hitman genre but ill be damned if it wasnt smart funny incredibly witty with its irony and just all around greats goal isnt to add a brand new take on hitman movies at parts it plays on some of the same strategies as lock stock and two smoking barrels but it still has its very original voice and execution i think what made this film stand out so much for me was its brilliance in irony the screenwriter martin mcdonagh and director knew exactly what he wanted to do and more important knew what the audience thought he was going to dotherefore twisting the story into many unpredictable moments and further he was able to build up these amazingly funny and oddly morallycompelling situations for his characters like when watching the ocean 111213 movies where you know the cast is pretty much just having one big party while filmings story makes it seem like mcdonagh had his own little writingpartydeciding never to restrict himself when challenging his characters morals and always doing so in very amusing fashions and constantly trying to make us guess where to next i would love to go deeper into many ironic scenes but im afraid that would make the film less rewarding for those who havent seen it and if you have seen it im sure you already know what im talking aboutaside from all the compliments i want to keep giving this film i do have one beef its one of those beefs that you let slide because the movie as a whole is just so well done however i feel i should bring it up brieflyperhaps somebody can clear it up for me the only issue i had had to do with brendan gleesons character ken its never really explained just why ken gets so attached to ray colin farrell we know the governing reason of why he feels sorry for him and we know why ray hates himself however within the actions of the film we find out that while ray is very new to the hitman occupation ken has been in the business for awhile now because this is the case i feel like ken would have had to encounter moral dilemmas like the main one in this film before yet he reacts very differently during this moraldilemma but i never understood why this time was so different what was it that he saw in ray that was so moving surely hes seen reactions like rays before within this kind of professionnevertheless my small complaint is nothing to dwell on strictly because everything else is so well executed and fun each actor gives a pitchperfect performance owning their moments when needing to and bowing down to their partners when needing too and fiennes scene when smashing the phone had me on the floorsorry i just really wanted to give that scene a shot out,black_comedy
reading through these comments one is struck by how much goodwill there is to this film one would think that only those with their noses out of joint would bother writing negative comments but to have the overwhelming reaction positive shows how engaging this film is to have colin farrell as the star would normally stop me from sitting in front of the telly to watch him for 90 minutes but he provides a sympathetic nuanced performance without going over the top which would have been understandable given the storyline gleeson is given ample screen time to show why hes one of irelands great thespians i was first introduced to him in the film i went down although i cant for the life of me remember that film apart from the nonsensical reason given for the title i do remember gleesons performance as a revelation that singlehandedly raised an otherwise nondescript film and fiennes once again shows no matter the genre hell step up and nail it his accent is spoton i thought for a minute theyd hired michael caine to phone in a cameo when i first heard his voice the plot itself is nothing to get worked up over and the various turns used to stretch out the film are a bit laboured but with the sublime humour and great dialogue it doesnt matter and what a setting my main issue was the ending where it rather fell apart for me in terms of believability but it is truly minor compared to everything that makes up this movie this is definitely worth an evening in to watch wwwlairdkeirspaceslivecom,black_comedy
when the title first struck our ears i couldnt believe it they were gonna film a british movie in my home town i was astonished who would want to film a movie in our little city martin mcdonagh it seemed we were all so very excited it was very rare for a flemish city to be picked as a location for a blockbuster moviemy work was in the hart of the city so i passed the set almost every day and i even did some extra work on it by then we had also heard that colin farrel brendan gleeson and ralph fiennes would be in it and we were all thrilled to welcome them girls from local schools were saying they got colins phone number girls who said they had a drink with colin and he tried to seduce them saying theyd met brendan and ralph in the street it was everyday talk i didnt believe much of it until i met them myself they were just about to film the outside scene at the belfry tower and as i passed i just waved and brendan and ralph waved back me and my stupid head went to them and asked hows filming going and to my utter amazement they just answered politely very well thanks although it is rather coldi recently saw the full version of the film and it is great to see how good it was they really did a great job on making bruges look enchanting but in fact it always does i think that they didnt have a lot of work to make it beautiful it already is the script was great and the casting sublime if you havent seen it yet go out to the cinema or buy the dvd you wont regret not after youve seen our wonderful city and the splendid acting performances,black_comedy
i love focus features they have really become a trademark for fine little quality movies is yet another one of those i wouldnt have expected too much from a colin ferrell movie but ferrell is as great as the movie itselfno movie classic has ever been made a character explains at one point and that can be seen as a bit of a cocky announcement that was going to be the first movie to change that while writerdirector martin mcdonagh didnt deliver a full on classic is bound to become connected to that beautiful fairy taletown for quite a whilewhile cast script direction and score are all very pleasing its the ending where mcdonagh takes some wrong turns suddenly the plot becomes implausible characters motivations are unbelievable and mindless chase sequences take over its not enough to ruin the movie but it keeps from becoming a genuine masterpiece having said that mcdonaghs film is still this years first really memorable and original sleeper way to go focus features,black_comedy
i hope martin mcdonagh is cutting harold pinter in for a piece of the gate on this not content with rippingoff pinters twohander the dumbwaiter in case you didnt see it thats the one where two hit man are killing time  sorry about that  whilst waiting to learn their next assignment which turns out to be for one to snuff the other and extending it he also borrows the pinter style of dialogue this doesnt make it a bad film but it does make it unoriginal i dont know what it is with irish writers and ripoffs its not so long since one of them wrote something called dancing at lughnasa which featured a dysfunctional family living in the depression with a son walking out of the action to spout linking narrative and then returning to the action nothing wrong with that if tennessee williams hadnt done the same thing years earlier in the glass menagerie anyway back to bruges where colin farrell is being as un pc as its possible to be  and i have absolutely no problem with that if nothing else we get some great scenery and that with the fairly decent acting makes it worth seeing even if mcdonagh is only the caretaker for pinter,black_comedy
after the oscar success of six shooter and a great reputation as a play write much was expected of martin mcdonaghs first feature film he duly delivers with a fantastic film with commercial appeal that renews faith in british filmthe story is simple and on the surface may draw groans from people sick to death of british cinemas neverending obsession with gangster films two irish criminals must lay low for two weeks while the heat from a bungled hit in london passes as they wait on a phone call from their boss one of the men is keen to explore this new town making the most of his time there while the other despairs at being in a place he compares to purgatory failing to see the point in going round looking at buildings all he wants to do is drink belgian beer and wait it out meanwhile in london their boss cockney gangster a la don logan begins to reveal the real reason for sending them to this townfirst of all the location is master stroke a picturesque town in europe that not many will have heard of before as the poster points out below the title in brackets it says its in belgium this is the first of many jokes delivered with aplomb as for the acting and characters at first i wasnt sure i was going to like colin farrels character he seemed ignorant annoying and a little ott but he quickly grew on me especially when his interest is finally sparked not by the prospect of sightseeing but instead by a midget on a film set as more is revealed about his character the more i liked him as for brendan gleeson who was also in six shooter he is a very good actor versatile and intelligent he has a face that draws you in and keeps you comfortable ralph fiennes as harry the boss with a clear code of ethics and conduct is blatantly doing an impression of don logan from sexy beast but he does a good job and by the end we find this is not only amusing but appropriate to the plot line the other performance worthy of noting is that of elizabeth berrington who plays the beautiful dutch love interest for colin farrel her accent is convincing and her character is cheekily likablethe script is brilliant full of jokes satire and poignant moments the story fizzes along and on reflection not a second of screen time seemed wasted the plot ties everything in by the end but refuses to end sympathetically the final twenty minutes or so do become very dark and those familiar with six shooter may not be surprised by this or mcdonaghs ability to retain the humour and believability despite the nasty things that occur this is best demonstrated by the selfeffacing humour as the film knowingly sends up previous gangster films whilst never really feeling too familiarall in all i went to see this expecting it to be good and was happy to find it is better than that the audience in the screening i attended also thoroughly enjoyed it laughing all the way through and passing positive comments afterwards i cant wait for martin mcdonaghs next film it seems we brits have another star director in the making,black_comedy

i saw at the cinema last night and i havent enjoyed myself so much in ages martin mcdonaghs film is apparently a first for him and on the strength of this work he should be schmoozed or lashed into making a lot more this story of two hit men in the doghouse holed up for two weeks is as dark a comedy as ive seen in some time but it works on every level this beautifully shot film is a wonderful advert for bruges belgiums touristic jewel in the crown and is accompanied by an excellent score brendan gleason colin farrell and ralph fiennes in a very different kind of role from his usual are all excellent gleasons character is a worldweary almost fatherly figure who gives the impression that hes ended up being a hitman almost by accident farrells character is by turns boorish and childish yet charming and likable at the same time the language is frequently crude but fitting to the characters portrayed here the story has an inevitability about it and so there may not be too many surprises for the viewer but it hardly seems to matter i cant praise this film too highly and i urge all adults to see it,black_comedy
i did enjoy this movie made me chuckle and colin farral was very good made me laugh ralph fiennes was good as the baddie the setting was ideal although i wouldnt want to visit there story did get slow in parts but the laughs kept coming so padded the story out the dwarf man was a added bonus to the film and in end made the story line come together the film was the correct length and never got bored a lot of near the bone comments which the film makers got away with in the context it was used this is a sure hit in the box office and colin farrells best work to date i may even go and see it again or wait for dvd,black_comedy
forget all that sundance crap regardless if you consider sundance the protector umbrella of the last good scripts or just an overblown indie front this movie is good and it is good at more levels than onethe acting first of all is great all the actors are top notch to a degree that i havent seen in a long time colin farrell does his usual bad boy performance but he adds a lot of emotional dimensions to his act really good job i like ralph fiennes and he seems he got the bad bug after he played voldemort and he will be playing more negative roles from now onthe script is funny to laugh at and sad to cry it is both complex in metaphors and simple enough to be enjoyed by anyone a truly good script if ive ever seen one a bit boring at the start but hey it was setting the stage for a great actthe music wasnt bad either the location a medieval burg in belgium called bruges was nice too all in all a must see what the hell ill rate it 10 out of 10,black_comedy
when the movie begins you think that youre about to watch something cool it happens because you still didnt learn much about the main characters very quick and without writing a spoiler for you you understand that the heroes of the movie are murderers brutal murderers and then starts the stupidity of the movie which is and this is something i really hate the fact that for some reason youre suppose to like those murderers and follow them through the movie as if they were saints the director doesnt waste any known trick in the book to make sure that those murderers would seem likable sensitive funny and even charming and that the audience would fall in love with them laugh with them and cry for them why dont ask me but let me tell you this if only they were the brutal unlikable unfunny and not at all the charming murderers that they really are this movie would have probably worked but as it is its no more than a bloody fake fake fake fake only in one scene they act if only for a moment as the real murderers that they are and thats probably the best scene in the movie i wonder who said that you have to fall in love with the heroes any kind of heroes in a movie rather than excepting them for what they really are and having to deal with them in an honest way probably a fool other than that this film is all about who is going to shoot who when will someone shoot someone else and how will one shoot the other or in other words a totally faked stupidity sorry not my cup of tea,black_comedy
i sat through the entire film despite nearly falling asleep during the first half it was disappointing the plot starts out nicely a story about a young man who kills people for money and is drowning in remorse after accidentally killing a little boy his partner always by his side and both of them in the beautiful city of bruges to hide after his awful act it could go somewhere right it didnt positive aspects i genuinely liked the way it was filmed it almost had this french ambiance to it i dont know how to explain it it feels like those artsy films with a deep and sad ending kind of like 500 days of summer i was even able to enjoy the humour poorly mixed between the awful way the plot developed and again the city is absolutely beautiful and both me and my boyfriend are now obsessed with traveling therenegative aspects right when the bad guy travels to bruges it goes completely nuts the film just stops being realistic seriously ken is shot once in the foot once in the neck jumps off a tower doesnt die and is still able to tell ray that the bad guy is coming for him also no one hears any shot specially that one when harry is on that small boat and the guy whos piloting the boat doesnt even react to it and dont get me started on the ending it was not realistic it was disappointing confusing and just a waste of my time,black_comedy
two hit men named ken brendon gleeson and ray colin farrell are sent to a small town in belgium and told to wait for further instructions it is then disclosed that ray has accidentally killed a young boy in a church while in the process of killing his assigned target and this event has haunted ray deeply ken fully understands and tries to console ray the best that he can but because ray is so neurotic it becomes quite a challenge in itself however things change quickly when ken is informed by their boss harry ralph fiennes that his next assignment is to killray now in between some beautiful scenery a fairly interesting plot and a good dose of irony there is more than a little profanity which some might believe gives the movie its flavor to me it just seemed crass and vulgar which further lowered my opinion of it considering the high rating i am obviously in the minority but in any case i have rated this film accordingly below average,black_comedy
i found myself compelled to write a review about this movie if only to relive a little bit the experience it starts slow a bit overdramatic but it builds up into something powerful something you cant and dont want to forget it became one of my personal favourites the first time i watched it the second time was as good as the first and i wanna watch again somedaythere is just something about this movie there is a lot of very unique concepts like drama mixed with midgets humor and climatic changes mixed with dark humor carrying these concepts to the big screen is the perfect cast that made me totally change my mind about collin farrells value as an actor and showcased ralph fiennes in a godlike performance of the perfect antagonist you come to like way more than the protagoniststhe dialogue are perfect and the story while balanced between simple and complex carries a punch that lands with power and precision its an instant favourite that i hope will become more and more know as the years pass by,black_comedy
written and directed by mcdonagh it is his first feature movie his irish drama writer background shows throughout each scene witty dialogues blackhumor slightly melancholic yet full of action i cant recall any movie that is this much literary while also being a tarantinolike homage to b action moviesits about two hit men but they hardly seem to be inclined to any killing and actually they hardly kill anyone during the entire movie they are quite nice persons with empathy remorse even some romantic sentiments  yes the whole story is quite absurd but endlessly entertaining the actual plot hardly matters every scene is worthy by itself if only for the unsurpassable acting c farrell r fiennes etc not incidentally the cinematography is also close to perfectioni gave it only 910 because there are some little clichs here and there but it is a slight disappointment only in comparison to this otherwise very unique movieif you have seen and enjoyed this movie see also mcdonaghs earlier short movie six shooter 2005 strange but fun and definitely see his second feature movie seven psychopaths 2012 which is quite similar to in nature,black_comedy
was an absolute masterpiece its a dark sentimental and actionpacked dream the characters mixed perfectly together and the plot was interesting the whole way through i laughed throughout and i was in tears too i was browsing netflix just looking for a movie with my family and picked this im so glad we did i loved this beyond words and enjoyed every second of it 10 out of 10 is an understatement has to be one of the best movies i have seen i recommend mature audiences only at least parental guidance of course there is coarse language and a little bit of gory violence there isnt too much sexual content and there is a few moments showing the use of cocainesnorting other than that its ok if youre looking for a great movie watch this,black_comedy
the first half of the film is not entirely the approach you expected it can be boring for some and perhaps will keep most of you skeptical but wait till you see the most significant scene and a sudden sense of interest will strike you youll be amazed how quick your perception towards this film change funny and very humorous thrilling dramatic action with a touch of violence and has a bit of romance all in one the acting was superb and all characters are well developed and all serve its own purpose it may be the simplest plot but the most well written and done in a sensational mannerits appalling how underrated this great film is and doesnt have the recognition it supposed to have,black_comedy
im not sure whether it was the fact i could relate to the dark irish humour but i thought this movie was absolutely hilariousas a girl not saying all girls feel like this but anchorman borat and stepbrothers just werent doing it for me but when i came across this movie i was in stitches literally crying and laughing out loudif youre browsing through imdb trying to find a good comedy  look no further if i could erase my movie memory and watch this again i would do so in a flashit has witty comedy beautiful cinematography and well colin farrell 10 out of 10,black_comedy
i absolutely adored thats pretty much it i enjoyed it so much im finding it hard to write this review and give the film justice instead of just spewing out complimentsit was wonderfully crude poignant and violent with lots of swearing and smutty jokes the acting was excellent throughout as well as the chemistry between colin farrell and brendon gleeson the humour was wonderful and made me laugh out loud several times with pure glee such as being blanked by an american dwarf and calling him a little cntit was such a breath of fresh air and i would gladly give this film a 10 but reserve that score for those truly wonderful movies that stand the test of time i pinched myself when i watched it for the first time just wishing i could watch it afresh all over again but sadly knowing the experience could never repeat on second viewing i appreciated the film just as much but a very small spark was missing meaning that it isnt quite 1010 material because although wonderful isnt quite brilliant and wont get better over the yearsi was really entertained by this treat of a film that i enjoyed so much,black_comedy
it was a typical winter night at dhaka and i had coffee mag while i watched for the first time simply blew my mind off dark and indirect humor superb making its the story of two contact killer working under the same shade the most attracting thing about this movie is the conscience these people hold inside even the notorious villein has a strong bit of conscience inside another catchy thing is that it brings out a lot of subject to think about for the audience unpredictable and kinda shakespearean ending all in all one of the best movies i have ever seen hats off to martin mcdonagh,black_comedy

i remember getting really angry at an article in either total film or empire that featured a list of films that were supposedly quentin tarantino ripoffs as you can probably guess was on said list being of the opinion that is better than any tarantino movie and significantly better than any one that isnt inglorious basterds this really annoyed me the list seemed to be based on the idea that if a movie features swearing violence and a lot of dialogue then it must be a tarantinowannabe thats stupid for a number of reasons the main one of which being that swearing violence and dialogueheavy scripts were not invented by a guy whose first film came out in 1992 another reason is that whilst tarantinos films often seem so desperate to adhere to the boundaries theyve set themselves they often suffer as a result without these boundaries is a very different and much better movieobviously its funny that doesnt need to be said look at literally any review of this movie and people will tell you how hilarious and quotable this movie is i think one of the things thats most impressive though is how ballsy it is when it comes to rooting the characters in real emotion every character in the movie spends at least 95 of its runtime being super depressed in addition to this half the scenes end on a depressing silence rather than a witty punchline the combination of these two elements along with the obvious choices of music and setting add up to a film that is evidently trying and succeeding to make the audience do more than laugh its an incredibly courageous move on the part of martin mcdonagh a man who id name as the greatest writer living today the trailers advertise as some kind of wacky gangster comedy but in fact its something much more raw and deep than that delving into much more complex themes than any other comedy ive seenbut thats not all this is my second favourite movie of alltime so obviously im going to be enamoured with pretty much every frame of it from the perfectlymaudlin intro to the script letting the jokes come naturally instead of forcing contrived situations down the viewers throat in fact another thing i love the way that theres not a single bit of fat on the script by this i mean that every single scene is intrinsic to a full understanding of the final scenes of the film both in terms of understanding the plot and to a greater extent reading the thematic elements of the movie credit goes to the editors for this more than mcdonagh as the dvd shows around 30 minutes of deletedextended scenes i feel like is a pretty much perfect movie in that its genuinely funny smart deep imaginative wellacted and so many more things that ive forgotten to mention so yeah screw anyone who would even consider this to be in any way tarantinoinspired,black_comedy
there are a lot of comic moments in this film mainly in the form of the things ray says and does few films make me laugh out loud but this one did in more than a couple of places the drama comes mainly in the final third and i found this put a much darker complexion on the comedic scenes that preceded it i liked the ending it seemed quite poetic in a way sorry no clues over all a very enjoyable film with some laughs excellent cinematography and some great performancessteelmonsters verdict highly recommendedmy score 8310you can find an expanded version of this review on my blog thoughts of a steelmonster,black_comedy
this was my favorite film of 2008 its rare that a film can come along and affect you in a way that makes you laugh and makes you really connect with the struggles of the lead characters this is exactly what does and it does it with such an unpretentious and dramatic flair you really connect with each character and see why colin farell is perfect in his role as the man child ray his tempo comedic timing and childishness never overshadow his true feelings and he brings a lot of heart into it brendan gleeson is mesmerizing as he plays an old hitman facing a very hard decision and you really see him go back and forth ralph fiennes almost steals the show as the foul mouthed cold but with a human side mob boss the supporting artists are even cast well from the dwarf jimmy to the hotel owner marie to the arms dealer yuri they each play their parts believably and at the same time hilariously however the star here is the screenplay what effortlessly balances some of the juvenile humor and the hard hitting questions the movie arises one of my favorite movies,black_comedy
at first i wasnt sure what to make of this smallscale crime thriller that follows the exploits of a couple of hit men hiding out in a european city after a job gone wrong the profane script recalls guy ritchie not in a particularly good way and the characters are difficult to warm to the tone is quite uneven with black comedy being the order of the day as the script sees the characters ruminating on bizarre characters and occurrences such as when they become involved with a dwarf actor currently staying in the city i was tempted to switch off during the first half then the narrative becomes to be more focused and the second half becomes a lot more entertaining i found myself warming to both of the leads a given with the reliable gleeson but a surprise as colin farrell isnt a favourite of mine as their humanity becomes evident and things build up to a thrilling eventful climax that never disappointsthe onscreen antics are small scale but the acting strong and the pacing spot on ralph fiennes contributes an extended cameo as the duos violent employee and uses it as a showcase for some overthetop ranting and humorous scenes i enjoyed the sense of darkness that pervaded the film particularly as the ending grows near and while its not a favourite i did find this a solidly enjoyable outing thats more original than most,black_comedy
after a botched hit job on a priest two hit men are sent to hide out thats belgium until they receive further instructions however when those instructions arrive its not the happy ending they may have been hoping foris pretty much awesome it has the english mafia mentality of guy ritchies work with a fair amount of action and violence but it also has a sentimental side that ritchie doesnt really touch upon in his tales these are men who not only kill but can love and have their own moral code of right and wrongcolin farrell shines here if he never did anything else he could still be remembered for this film hes also decent in dr parnassus and then you have ralph fiennes who pretty much never makes a bad film even when its a sappy romantic comedy more than any other role harry fiennes brings out the anger and the controlthis film is snatch brought to the next level with some of the third man thrown in a few unpredictable twists and turns and some lively characters that are unique in more ways than one i highly recommend this film for anyone,black_comedy

in many ways is something of a little gem it is marketed as a dark comedy and it is indeed very funny if you like dry wit and irony and enjoy seeing the world through the eyes of two dublin men who have rather inexplicably been ordered to leave london and lie low in an obscure flemish town that these two men happen to be killers is initially neither here nor there they could  or at least brendan gleeson as the older and more mature hitman could  be just like any two tourists you might meet seeing the sights of a beautiful medieval town colin farrell the second younger hitman is not at all enamoured of bruges and sightseeing and his lack of sophistication is typified when he memorably describes history as just a load of stuff that has happened where is not something of a little gem is when it is reluctantly forced to abandon the irish whimsy  one of the central conceits of a hitman taking time off to relax and enjoy a spot of culture is nothing if not whimsical  and begins to plod down the more familiar paths of filmmaking convention thus the various whimsical strands of the story all come together in a rather neat finale which is unfortunately too neat to be satisfying the writerdirector michael mcdonagh cant be blamed for that and as this is only his second feature  and his first fulllength feature  his handling of the techniques of filmmaking is outstanding so far he has written plays for the stage and in many ways is still a play which has been transferred to the big screen and that is not meant in a derogatory way the dialogue is naturalistic and at times exquisite but in a sense is still a play in that mcdonagh wants to deal with rather big themes conscience guilt a sense of honour loyalty and revenge and what might have worked well on stage finally doesnt work quite as well on the screen although oddly both the gleeson and farrell characters are rather likable despite the fact that they have killed without mercy for money by the end of the film they dont quite ring as true as they did when we first meet them similarly despite ralph fienness character being established as a sadistic crime boss without heart or feeling his final honourable act is also wholly unconvincing so where does that leave us well because in so many way is the excellent side of good the reservations i make are rather ungenerous my point is that because so much of the film is very good it sets itself such high standards that when in just a few respects it doesnt quite meet those standards this apparent failure stands out all the more let me be clear is streets ahead of many other films which masquerade as comedy or thriller or drama in hindsight there are one or two niggles such as the implausibility of the farrell character being discovered and arrested on a train leaving bruges the way that various characters conveniently bump into each other and it has to be said the implausibility of some of the characters motivation but at the end of the day these are minor points stands alone and has an identity all of its own i do however suspect that whether or not you enjoy will largely depend on what kind of films you otherwise enjoy yes there is a chase at the end and yes it all ends in bloody murderous violence but these elements to not define the film if you are the kind of moron who values so much of the dishonest quickcut superslick inyerface mush which keeps the cinema cash tills ringing you would undoubtedly feel your attention and interest flag long before the guns are fired if on the other hand you have the wit and taste to watch a story unfold however implausible that story might finally be and enjoy the kind of irish dry humour which is not inyerface your will enjoy very much,black_comedy
what a splendidly executed dramatic comedy about two irish hit men wandering around the ancient city of bruges belgium everything seems to come together everything synchronized and the chief credit must go to the writer and director martin mcdonagh with myriad plaudits left over for the actors the photographer the typically insinuating score by carter burwell and all the other elements of the filmcolin farrell is a hit man in london on his first assignment from boss ralph fiennes he shoots a priest and accidentally a little boy waiting to make his confession the guilt haunts him although aside from the occasional act of putting a pistol to his head and cocking it it doesnt otherwise seem to interfere with his enjoyment of lifefarrell and another murderer the plump but perceptive brendan gleeson are sent to bruges to await a phone call from fiennes identifying their next target while sitting around instead of twiddling their thumbs they visit the medieval old city at gleesons insistence farrell is nervous and impatient while gleeson is enthralled by the cathedrals the canal and the last judgment a triptych by heironymous bosch it prompts farrell to observe that bruges itself might serve as a proper hellin fact it just about does gleeson finally receives the longawaited call from fiennes who inquires about farrells appreciation of bruges did he visit the cathedral yes did he see all the paintings yes the canal yes but gleeson doesnt think thats farrells thing did he see the swans are the swans still there yes long pause on the phone well then what does he ing mean its not his ing thing fiennes has sent the two of them there intending this trip to be a last present to farrell whom gleeson must now kill for having murdered that young boy a violation of principle which must be atoned for in the end gleeson refuses fiennes himself comes to bruges to straighten things out and there is a violent climaxthe brutality is as gory and realistic as the comedy is funny the dialog sparkles and there were some lines and some conversational exchanges that made me laugh out loud the characters are quirky and interesting in themselves farrell gets wildly excited when he sees a movie crew filming a scene with a dwarf there filming midgets he exclaims running to the shootthis is pretty dangerous territory for a movie when you get right down to it you know  whimsy involving idiosyncratic hit men a pregnant concierge a dwarf who complains about how much  hes had to take from black midgets cocaine a russian arms dealer who wonders if hes using the right word when he talks about alcoves a beautiful young woman who supplies film crews with dope its the kind of story that could easily try to coast along on its phantasmic charm but the plot is strong enough to hold in one channel the divagations into saintly relics and restaurant fist fights with americans who complain about europeans blowing cigarette smoke in their direction that last incident the one about smoking in a restaurant is emblematic of the entire film its a misunderstanding and a bloody one the impulsive farrell decks the american zeljko ivanek saying thats for john lennon you  only to discover later that the american was a canadian and that he farrell had made another violent errorwell i guess i wont go on about it although to be sure were talking about more than just two murderers taking a vacation in belgium there are religious undertones  or more generally moral ones  galore the logic doesnt always maintain its integrity eg farrell is supposed to be eliminated because he accidentally killed a little boy  but whacking the priest during confession was okayim not so sure that kids would either understand it or enjoy it but see it when you get a chance,black_comedy
im no critic so excuse me if my review is not as eloquent and insightful as some but i do enjoy giving my views on filmswas a complete surprise to me i didnt really expect to like it as much as i did i hadnt heard much about the film before i watched it and found myself enjoying every minute of iti have never been a big colin farrel fan but he was spot on in this film he managed to balance the emotions of the character superbly between humour and despair agitation and excitement innocence and guilt he made the character interesting and believable brendan gleeson wouldnt seem like an obvious choice to pair him up with but as they bounce witticisms off each other the comedy is very funny ralp fiennes cold icy character added another enjoyable dimension to the filmthe dialog was excellent from start to finish the sound track strangely worked as well it was almost haunting and combined with the medieval backdrop of bruges created a good atmospherethe ending was exciting and rewardingoverall i think this is a superb filmcheers,black_comedy
in my opinion martin mcdonaghs directorial debut can easily be classified as a resounding success from the opening sequence straight to the almost too farfetched ending is full of energy and intrigue the screenplay is quite brilliant especially for the first 8085 minutes or so mixing elements of comedy drama and thriller in a quite enjoyable motion picture the last 1015 minutes however arguably seem rushed as if mcdonagh had almost felt as if he had written himself into the proverbial corner some of the events that occur here seem a bit too improbable at least two such events come to mind and outoftouch with the deliberate pacing of the rest of the film nonetheless the academy saw it fit to nominate his work for best original screenplay and i personally applaud the nomination despite the aforementioned flawsi have always been a fan of colin farrell for his performances of unorthodox rolescharacters and this has to be one of his best portrayals in years brendan gleeson is also fantastic as his more levelheaded companion and the synergy between the lead characters is quite awesome ralph fiennes reprises another villainous role and does so quite superbly in all the casting was excellent as the characters manage to enhance the already brilliant screenplay moreover the cinematography and score are very good with the scenic shots of bruges enhancing the overall atmosphere of the filmis full of memorable scenes and lines undoubtedly accentuated by the irish tongues of farrell and gleeson worthy of multiple viewings 810 3 stars out of 4 should enter my top 200 at 183 highly recommended,black_comedy
ray farrell and ken gleeson go to bruges to cool their heels and wait for a telephone call from harry fiennes because the last hit had gone really bad ray and ken are assassinsremember the old saying what happens stays hmmmmdidnt think so well anyway this is truly a good story masterfully told all the cast are oscar worthy but special attention must be paid to colin farrell one day the powers that be will notice for a while there i thought this was another woody allen movie  this time with humor and humor abounds in here however this is a serious drama that just happens to have some very good lines and of course acting timing is everything and it shows up in here all over the place i cannot relate some of the good lines because some language is associated with many of them oh because i said ray and ken are assassins please dont think this is another bourne movie no this is rather slow but very engaging if truth be told you will be sad to see it end btw bruges is in belgiumviolence yes sex no nudity no language yes and there is a tendency for movies to start using some other derogatory words not good,black_comedy
writerdirector martin mcdonagh has fashioned a little gem of a crime thrillerblack comedy with his film its quirky and eccentric but in a way that comes naturally and doesnt feel remotely forced and despite the running joke about bruges being such a boring and dull place to be the movie makes the city itself look lovelyray colin farrell and ken brendan gleeson play two hit men who hole up in the titular city awaiting orders from their boss harry played by ralph fiennes both suffer a crisis of conscience  ray because his first hit resulted in his accidentally killing a little boy ken because his orders once they come are to bump off ray who annoys him but who he rather likes when ken tells harry he refuses to kill ray harry comes after the two men himself resulting in a quite violent finalemcdonaghs background in theatre shows especially in his writing the screenplay to is a marvel tightly wound and compact its fresh and surprising traits that dont frequently describe movie scripts nowadays the movie is viciously funny but the relationship between ray and ken is also rather moving and the violence and boy is it graphic at times is very disturbing precisely because we come to care so much about the characters its happening toall of the performances but especially those of farrell gleeson and fiennes are superb mcdonagh proves himself to be a good director of actors and he handles his own material masterfully he even manages to make midget humor the stuff of movie comedy clichs funny againgrade a,black_comedy
another case of failed marketing the trailer for this film did nothing to interest me but i finally saw it based on a glowing recommendation im glad i didthe film is at times alternately laughoutloud funny and touchingly dramatic its success hinges greatly on the performance and chemistry of its two leads colin farrell and brendan gleeson and both do phenomenal jobs especially farrell helped by a witty script by martin mcdonagh it had a very rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead feel to it colin farrells role is an excellent departure from his usual characters this one odd hilarious and almost childlike i would love to see him and brendan gleeson score oscar nominations for their performances in this film but they wont,black_comedy
in quick sentence regarding the plot this is the story of a man finding it hard to live with himself at core it is a story about redemptionit is unique in its artistic form truly emotional and thought revoltingif you are looking for antihero characters search no more you will certainly find those here i give credits to martin mcdonagh for an excellent direction that combines art in many forms and dialogs with absolute reality as how it is perceived or interpreted the feature contains many rude jokes and even racism but towards making points that are entirely valid in order to reflect deep sadness or depression for example rarely seen on the silver screen this days as of not just going after your emotions as for you to think you like the movie  but instead for making sure that you will be able to analyze and reflect on your own personal thoughts on certain universal life related problems andor possible solutionsinterpretationsalso i am sure that this movie will suffer tons of criticism but that is exactly what makes it special in a true sense it teaches without preaching and that alone for me is a great achievement in being able to understand reality as being perceived from different points of view other then my ownthe above comments are intended for anyone watching the movie entirely i say this because the introduction is quiet slow but has the point as in making the human mind relax firstas well as normalize the viewer and characters relations to each other soon after the central character ray will intrigue you enough at least to keep your attention and ask your own questionshowever after about 30 minutes the plot reveals itself and the wachy scenes are more and more interesting the park scene comes to mind as well as the hotel one involving hookers and racist midget situations were you can not be sure which sides has less evil something as you do not choose the sides the sides choose youi think that upholding skin color equality comes before upholding the height ones feel free to disagreealso take the restaurant scene as well with the canadian guy played by zeljko ivanek as a canadian myself to me that scene is absolutely hilariousas regarding our wacky smoking regulations we have in ontario at leastas a matter a fact there are quiet a few takes on how north americans and europeans perceive each otheras a viewer you will be inclined to pick a side to the argument no matter what your common sense political correctness might dictatei was impressed with colin farrell performance here note that brendan gleeson is great as well but the character is secondary note that i used to completely disliked this actor  considering him a porno facewhere he actually started his career and as well for such bad performances as in swat or alexanderwhere the plot really did not help his cause either on miami vice i started thinking that i might had been wrong in my judgment and after watching this one i realized i certainly been so indeedanna madeley and clmence posys characters are very sweet and so much down to earth even if their good lucks enhance the visuals but undermine the conclusionsralph fiennes as harry the mob boss has only a few scenes but very very entertaining ones as a small example seeing an uzi submachine gun on the merchandise tablean uzi i am not from south central los fu angelesi did not come here to kill 20 black 10yearolds in a fu drivebyi want a normal gun for a normal person as about how normal his character is remains open for interpretationfrom the very first scene i noticed that the soundtrack contributes greatly towards an excellent mood defining aspect while somehow too standard for its score choices in this features genre it is very efficient in creating an intense calm mood in general required for rational thinking based and in accordance with what the visual shows to the viewer,black_comedy

after a hit on a priest goes wrong ray and ken the hit men involved are sent to bruges to hide out by their boss while there they get involved with a dwarf actor a female drug dealer and all the while ray complains about brugesi dont want to reveal a lot of the plot here but i have to say as a movie its never what you expect the script by writerdirector martin mcdonagh is very funny in a politically incorrect way mcdonagh also directs well getting good performances from brendan gleeson ralph fiennes and especially colin farrell this is probably his best performance yet the rest of the cast are all good too with a special mention to jordan prentice who plays jimmy the dwarf in the movie his character takes a bit of a kicking via comments in the script but he holds his own with the other actors in the movieas i stated the movie is very funny but its not a comedy instead its more of a character piece with every character well thought out in the movie and most get their own little moments however when harry fiennes shows up it sets up the dramatic climax with a burst of action which again mcdonagh handles well the climax of the movie is a little downbeat but yet seems right for the moviethe city of bruges takes takes a bit of beating in the script but it looks a wonderful city and gives some scenes a dreamlike quality it looks fantastic and a wonderful place to visitas is the movie,black_comedy
black comedy is a difficult thing to do very often a balance between hilarity and depth cannot be struck to the point that the amount of comedy is negligible a story of murder guilt suicide and violent gun hands faces this problem more than most it is therefore a delight that this film is one of the funniest for years as well as being wonderfully dark twisted and deepthe first thing to say is that this wont be for everyone it is uncompromisingly violent it quite literally doesnt pull any punches and it is filled to the brim with foul language but if youre not put off by any of this sort of thing then this is highly recommendedit is vaguely reminiscent of withnail and i it has three main characters who are all leading a fairly insane existence and who all find themselves in a place that they are alien to it is also one of the most fantastically sweary films since withnail but this is no ripoff this is one of the most fearlessly fresh films for some years and this is largely thanks to martin mcdonaghthe script is magnificent it may not provide much payoff for its philosophising and it does at the end descend into a bloody shootout that is slightly overcooked but it is interesting in what it explores and extremely entertaining it is the bizarre and brilliant humour that is the cornerstone of mcdonaghs work this is a comedy that pulls together witty surrealist observational gross out and subtle as well as distinctly unsubtle visual comic techniques with a heavy dose of character based gags to boot the result is an onslaught of humour that is irresistible mcdonagh also brings an attractive and striking look to the film with an impressive visual style that promises much for his future work not just as a writer but also as a directorhe is also blessed with a fine cast brendan gleesons quiet restrained and likable performance is the standout but a wonderful surprise is that the oftridiculed colin farrell almost steals the show with a brilliantly subtle and vulnerable turn the pair work superbly whenever theyre on screen together and they are handed a great deal of support posy as the love interest is very good as is jordan prentice playing the sardonic but flawed dwarf to use the films terminology ralph fiennes obviously enjoys himself hugely here given freereign in a part that demands overacting of the very highest calibre to display the insanity and menace of the characterthe film ends in a marvellous moment of ambiguity having touched on many themes prejudice life and death guilt forgiveness justice deontological ethics and the sanctity of life are all there and mcdonagh leaves it up to the audience to think about them it all adds up to a great time at the cinema funny thoughtful entertaining this blackest of black comedies is the genre nearing its very best,black_comedy
after a hit goes badly wrong two hired killers one of them older experienced and word weary the other raw inexperienced and emotional are ordered to hide out in the city of bruges in belgium and to await further instructions from the boss why beautiful old scenic bruges where nothing much happens and when it does happen it happens very slowly ah well there is a reason which is crucial to the plot and i am definitely not going to go into it hereits hard to know how to describe maybe it would be best to describe it as an existential comedy i dont know all i will say is that if samuel beckett or harold pinter had been commissioned to write an action moviebuddybuddy comedy they might have come up with something like there are definite echoes of waiting for godot and the dumb waiter in the dialogue the situations and the characterssimply put is just a gloriously funny and soblacklightbendsintoit comedy a brilliant confection of poetry cynicism innocence and slapstick great turns from brendan gleeson as the older philosophical hit man ken and ralph fiennes as barking mad essex dog harry possibly the most unstable british gangster seen on screen since ben kingsley in sexy beast maybe surprisingly for some colin farrell shows what a fine performance he can produce when cast in right part his young killer ray is a mixture of willfulness innocence childishness and regret you feel for him really you dowill not be a box office smash it is probably too lyrical and introspective for huge success and also it has hardly been promoted but i have no doubt that it will find its audience as a cult movie on dvd and on late night indie movie channel screeningsits a great film you should go and see it really you should,black_comedy
this is a brilliant film the story and scenery are great but it has been pirated on a camcorder which the user did not seem to know how to focus if you want this to copy to disc i suggest you do not use this copy i would recommend waiting for this film to be released on dvdthere are a couple of glaring errors i noticed on this film mainly the bell tower has a cage around the bells to prevent visitors from falling down the shaft or from touching the bells themselves the bells in that tower are irreplaceable antiques also the steps to the tower are too narrow to allow wellpadded people like one of the lead actors to be able to climb them easily also at the end another character runs down them which is dangerous and foolhardy as you cannot place your entire foot on the steps without half your foot hanging over,black_comedy
when i first viewed this film i had remembered the cover of the dvd which my brother owned and i thought it would be a simple bgrade action film i am so glad i was wrong because is a true gem which delves into the motifs of guilt and hellpurgatorywith the two main characters we have opposite sides of the personality  this has been said by mcdonagh himself there was a side of him which loved to sightsee ken and the side that just wanted to have fun ray from this we get a very cultured hit man as well as a moody young man itching to get the most out of life drinking meeting women exploringwhile i love ray for his internal struggles he is somewhat of a hard man to like he is brutally honest asks people whether they would kill themselves because of certain traits and he calls people gay or retarded but something has happened before the start of the story that makes him question his morality in the middle of the film and whether or not he should be punished for itthis film seems somewhat influenced by tarantino  at least for the dialogue aspect it is not plotbased it touches on pop culture references and includes lingo that make the characters seem more realistic or interesting than just characters however the problem is that it seems to try too hard at thishowever there are a good amount of funny conversations or situations in which the characters find themselves think tarantinos dialogue meets an even darker humor like the humor of the coen brothersone plausibility factor i cannot stand however is that one character simply refuses to die to avoid spoilers i will just say heshe lives way longer than they should have but this needs to happen to help the plot very late in the filmthe thing i love so much about this film is the ending monologue given by ray colin farrells character and the ambiguity behind what has happened to the character and whether this story should be considered a dark fantasy or a horrible reality it is very enjoyable and the themes are amazing but this film falls just short of perfectadded 51815 who am i kidding i love this movie and highly recommend it 1010,black_comedy
before i watched the movie i had great expectations about it some people were comparing the style to guy richies movies or tarantinos well im a fan of both their work so when i saw the movie i got a little annoyedbecause i always want to give movies a chance to watch i watched the whole movie as a result a had a terrible night i felt very dumb because i didnt understand it was it meant funny was it a cultural sort of movie for the intellectual i didnt get it at all the whole storyline was so boring to me there wasnt some tension or reason to feel excited too i also think directors have their own ways to entertain via film there are so many sorts of entertainment but i cant nail this one its not just that i want to burn it down but i dont think its funny or entertaining or a good written storyin the end the the subject got me thinking about a bigger perspective is this a cultural thing do i have to see the movie twice to get the point or am i infected to much with the hollywood poison that my expectations couldnt see this comingat last i wont say the acting was bad because i think it wasnt i think farrell and fiennes are great actors thats not the case but this movie a comedy seriously this review is full of questions  so finally im going to ask i know youre not about to explain jokes but somebody will for me,black_comedy
lets be honest the only reason im writing this review is the fact that i live myself im almost ashamed to admit that after seeing this nonsense the storyline is about as thin as the paper it was written on and filled with totally unbelievable plot twists imagine this one of the gangsters jumps off the belfry 84 meters high and has a nice little conversation when lying on the pavement he landed on if you think thats ridiculous wait until you see the ending its about the dumbest ive ever seen in any moviethe only thing theyve done right to shoot it in the most beautiful city in belgium the scenery is excellent and the only reason i rated 310 in stead of the 110 it would normally deserve people who know tell me that tourist revenues have gone up after this movie was made at least weve got something out of itbottom line dont watch this come to bruges its better than the movie,black_comedy
famous book famous set pretty famous people in it especially looking forward to ralph finnes rolehowever it added up to a generally speaking sordid movie in the endthe only thing i liked was the soundtrack and clemence poesys performance collins role was way too exaggerated and concluded with him looking like a complete retard the whole way through the movie the dialogue is very superficial and the plotline is somewhat meddled as if trying to elongate the story as much as humanly possible im just sorry that the movie has put me off reading the book,black_comedy
isnt anyone else getting tired of movies that seek to psychoanalyze hit men from leon to collateral what makes cinemas hired assassins tick has provided mileage for many a screenwriter the more we are secluded from violence and crime the more our fictional fascination with hit men and gangsters as agents of retribution and honour has perversely increased i think belongs to this trend allegorizing its ethical concerns through hieronymus boschs famous 15th century triptych the last judgement a demented vision of damnation which in the movies final scenes spills out onto the screen in the form of a surreal backstreet carnivalthe problem with these studies is that filmmakers are chasing their own shadow because cinema created the amoral hitman his character has no realworld location and no portrayal of him will ever be fully convincingmartin mcdonaghs script for better or worse barely dips its feet into this psychological subject matter and farrells turpitude is only suggested by his despicable acts of violence those aside he and gleeson seem like thoroughly likable blokes and serve well as foils to one another had the film been an outanout comedy their routine would have worked admirably but time and time again it oscillates toward a halfbaked moral agenda  which only serves to disrupt the tone of the movie this is yet another film showing how the combination of gangland gore and comedy  perfected in guy richies early work  is so difficult to pull of satisfyinglyis consequently an odd film that leaves an uneven impression by no means without laughoutloud moments of gallows humour it retains that penchant for selfdeprecation and the absurd characteristic of british comedy bruges itself is naturally gorgeous but nothing ever really rings true the various themes of the story are not adequately developed and the script barely scratches the surface of its dysfunctional characters essentially a gallery of grotesques it is perhaps fitting that the audience is left in a sort of interpretative limbo  bosch would certainly have approved,black_comedy
star rating  saturday night  friday night  friday morning  sunday night  monday morning after a hit in london goes wrong hit men ray colin farrell and ken brendan gleeson are told to wait a belgian town to await a call from harry ralph fiennes the crime boss who ordered the hit ray was responsible for the hit going wrong so its his neck most likely on the line and it doesnt help that while ken tries to take in the local culture and experience he sees everything wrong with it so as they await the call they must also come to terms with a town where everything seems foreign and weirdquentin tarantinos style of crime thriller writing has inspired some notable imitations one of which would appear to be this well received europe set film from martin mcdonaugh your sense of political correctness can be left well at the door as jabs at the chinese midgets and retards come thick and fast other problems though include it being a rather slow and talky film at times but its an undeniably sharp and well written film which makes it funny and thrilling as well performances wise its nice to see farrell back check out the scene where he talks to the midget and the prostitute double chin or what and theres nice support from gleeson and fiennes ditching his usual well spoken brit thing for a sharp cockney villain dialect ,black_comedy
this movie is listed as genre action comedy if this is a comedy then there will be blood should be listed as such as with blood there are moments of humor in this film but this material weighs in more as a serious drama with very dark moments the performances in this drama were excellent had i gone into the theater expecting a drama i would have enjoyed it more if enjoyed is the word to use for a violent film instead i felt ripped by the depth of serious issues portrayed it is well done but dont go expecting a comedy its a tragedy with a number of violent scenes  i cant imagine what the other commenters thought was so funny,black_comedy

ive just seen the movie and being from belgium flanders id like to add some factual errorsfirst of all theres a quite important scene set in a restaurant when a fight breaks out between the canadian and ray because the canadian comments on chlo smoking smoking in restaurants has been banned since january 2006second of all bruges brugge is a city in flanders flanders being the dutchspeaking part of belgium yet the locals seem to have a french accent except for marie and the ticket man theyre both flemish actors yuri is a waloon actor walonie is the other part of belgium where people speak french erik is from brussels also speaks french and chlo s from france,black_comedy
if you can manage to understand the extreme irish accents you may be able to make a tiny bit of sense out of this stupid film i had to keep the subtitles on  bought the flick in a large bulk load of dvds on ebay for a pittance so am not regretting my microscopic financial loss the two leading characters in this abortion appear as grossly retarded beings the pace is dreadfully slow pitifully so excruciating attempts at humour are frequent but fail awfully all in all i just do not know how this movie could possibly have gained a rating just short of 8 on the internetmoviedatabase plainly ridiculous the cast  crew must have a huge pile of friends out there not recommended  do anything else instead ,black_comedy
the movie has been described as having good black humor but it hasnt its so superficial and utterly insulting minorities without any humorous twist that there isnt something to laugh about theres not even a little nice movie story line only standard character developments no new message the movie wants to give us and youre stuck for half an hour even before the film plot really startsanother annoying part of the movie is the action scenes its totally unbelievable you wont get hit by a pistol from 35 yards and so it goes onapparently it is or was cool to like this movie i say dont waste your time on this,black_comedy

first review spoiler freehard to beleive its been 11 years since i first saw it a friend of mine showed it to me even though i could barely speak english at the time learning english in ireland is helpful though but even though i couldnt understand some of the dialogue i instantly fell in love with this moviethe main cast fiennesgleeson farell is just incredible and they deliver some of the best performance of their respective carreers dialogues are sharp and hilarious though never feel forced or out of place every details countwriting is good its definitly not a story youve heard before and the way the characters evolve and react is rarely seen in moviesdirection is masterfull photography is great the shots mostly at night of the city really set the mood from the very first scene as is the musicprobably one of the very best movie in the very tricky genre of dark comedy as some dialogues can be truly hilarious even though the set up is dark almost desperate at timea must see although it might not be for everyonebest movie from mcdonnagh so far in my opinion yes even better than three bilboards even though i loved it they actually have a lot in commonmcdonnagh might be one of the best director of his generation and i hope to see more in the future,black_comedy
when changing channels i almost skipped this one entirely thinking it was only going to be a actiongorefest  thrillerbut after watching it all the way through it turned out to be apart from a few seenitbefore characterdevelopment plot devices or perhaps from an original book to theatre to film character changes to match what some in movie audiences are usedto of assassinshitmenapart from a few of those and without wasting any time on pointless on screen gratuities that movies about wannabe gangsters and lonewolf tough guys etc sometimes gamble on and usually lose in terms of the difference between disposable trash for sadists compared to something with more of a yesassassinsarepeopletoo  inclusive effect of not quite humanising them but portraying similarities a if not the  were there one a human side of themyet this movie does do that but not overlysentimentally in terms of time spent by the regretfulsoftie creating filler for the production to save money by being asked to spend minute after minute looking out of a window on a train or into public spaces with a tear running down their cheeksinstead this movie has the regretfulsoftie having contrasting conflicting emotions in shorter reactive social exchanges in contrast with his mentorimmediate protector more in line with true regrets evocative depth effects rather than only temporary supposedly passing emotions of all assassinsthat simplification of supposedlyall is well brought down by this movie although one more thing  contrast of previousbetrayed peers  could have added another sinister context to the exploitation of the fresh hitman that could have better portrayed the exploitation the nothingtolosesincewelljustblowhimaway  betrayaldynamic that is often behind real world and fictional murderthe focus however on the inconstant rather than undercontrol emotions of the fresh unlucky hitman is quite effective as a criticalplotdynamic forif not all then most of the rest of the writings use of the differences between the two main characters and the outside force the demands from the ruthless bosses beyondabove which although a kind of deadend of character development since its a bit of a tragedy still allows for contrast rather than too similar personalities that it ends up some homogeneous gang psychopathicpersonality toughtalk wasted hour12that primarily allowed it to keep some perhaps unrealistic but unexpected interplay between the characters so that as you were exposed to more of their differences they got further apart naturally in terms of where they were going without there needing to be a plotdevice as well as the noticeable theme parts that one might yawn at from having seen before and able to predict the endingif someone who likes not to be able to predict an ending dont watch this movie it will seem predictable and 2nd rateif however you can appreciate mostlyseamless natural acting good cinematics a little bit of action natural production values for the setting to be believable enterableinto in terms of being able to quickly get your bearings rather than having tove read the book etcthen this is quite a good one in terms of a natural setting x beingabletobeeasilyfollowed  even if the for tragedys sake cut version of a original book or perhaps nottoocomplicated plot the characters are a little hearditbefore  and the ending predictableone thing that adds a nice touch however if that doesnt sound worth it is a fate twist in terms of rebirthingreincarnation potentials from potentials of shaping functions compared to genetics in a very broad sense of unknowns after death intermixed in fate with the main fresh guilty characters inability to resolve his own  a ok is something steppingin to compensate for an accident twist even though it would be such a slight fatetweaking by whichever that most of the movies choices still seem determined by the main charactersthat happens in tragedies of course but this one does not make it easy for the character deserving his thegodscantagree good fortune considering his line of employment even tho he considers himself unluckyquite a good contrast compared to the culpable experienced immediate boss and more ruthless one above himalso good in that sense in contrasting different kinds of opportunity in terms of life  death issues and fate in general without being too gory for a movie with assassins everywhere,black_comedy
feels like a pitch for a bizarre darkly comedic and british version of the departed unfortunately its not particularly successful the best parts of it are its effective comedic moments  mcdonaghs wit is evident throughout the script and keeps enjoyable scenes that would otherwise be dull and pointless i did feel that the comedy was more a series of individual funny moments than consistently being amusing throughout and its elements outside of comedy were disappointing on the whole the acting is pretty good but the plot felt more like absurdist commentary than actual substance while their basic character traits are obvious from the start we dont get a deeper understanding of why they are hitmen or much nuance in their relationship the movie centered on how terrible bruges is but i didnt think mcdonagh actually gave us a sense of the city it certainly didnt come alive or show me anything beyond what the main characters claim about it and seeing some tourists which is a serious flaw for a movie that focuses so much on the setting the first two acts were lacking in energy or things happening and the third had a fun performance from fiennes especially the scene when he called his wife an inanimate object and apologized i loved that but veered completely into the absurd and provided no closure or satisfaction yes it comes full circle as harry shoots him and in the process accidentally a kid and he kills himself as he said he would but that was not making any point or tying up any theme and instead just showing repetition with a flipped perspective for humor and absurdism the scene in the hotel where they gamify the death felt most silly to me and confirmed my distaste for the film overall the characters all die in pointless and somewhat self inflicted ways so maybe mcdonagh is trying to make a nihilistic point wrapped in a big joke about bruges but i was certainly hoping for more than that and didnt find it,black_comedy
waste of time dont even bother  movie is too slow and plot is non existant that would bore a five year old,black_comedy
femail narrative throughout the whole movie anyone else have this can it be turned off its not on any other movie thanks,black_comedy
28 january 2009 is an uncomfortable experience with colin farrell as a rather abrasive protagonist and not the most likable fellow who is both insensitive and a brute and its a wonder why a woman would actually like him while theres an effort to portray him with some remnant of sympathy his guilt seems to wear a bit thin this a beautifully well shot movie with much of the foreign flavor captured on film along with a lovely musical score the script is strong harsh brutal along with some rather risky comical inserts that are in a few places appear forced for aesthetic sake overall this is an intensely strong and moving film if one can except the characters their circumstances perhaps in some ways colin farrell reflects a little bit of reality of all of us the good and the dirty parts in this way the movie might be considered actually a black dark comedy of some note the ending is a bit convenient maybe too much so for the audiences discretion to make it what they want seven out of ten stars,black_comedy
this black comedydrama from martin mcdonagh is a masterpiece colin farrel brendan gleeson an ralph fiennes performed wonderful and the story is very very good watch this movie,black_comedy
once you get accustomed the heavy irish accent evolves into a beautifully crafted film with enough laughs and turns to keep you glued to your seats,black_comedy
i have never givena 1 but if i could id rate it negative stars there was no story line it was a chain of events that had no meaning considering this movie had 2 cast members from harry potter i thought it wouldve been good horrible acting stupid plot this was a waste of money couldve fed a lot of homeless people and not wasted my time on this extremely long movie,black_comedy
come fire or come waternailed itspot on on the acting levelthe ideal script,black_comedy
this film walks a tightrope between being quirkyhumorous and being darkbrutal colin farrell gives a very impressive multifaceted performance i dont know why this didnt get more publicity,black_comedy
few films engage me or command my attention  this has everything utterly superb and was brilliantly written directed and acted highly recommended,black_comedy
do really awful people have a strict moral code and deep conscience im going to guess no but suggests writerdirector martin mcdonagh might disagreebegins with two guys checking into a hotel they have come to wait an unspecified amount of time to speak to someone they go sightseeing one man loves bruges the other finds it tediousthis is maybe the first third of the movie which is sometimes amusing but doesnt give you much to hold onto then a flurry of things happen and an elaborate ingenious story kicks in and that part involves terrible people being shockingly full of scruplesthe film is very well acted and generally amusing with some dark and occasionally suspenseful moments yet i was never fully drawn in the ingenuity of the story and moral code of the protagonists felt like dramatic devices rather than something that comes from real life experience a false clever plot and unlikely characters is not inherently unworkable and i think the problem is less the script than that mcdonagh cant quite figure out how to flesh that script with human complexity something he successfully did in three billboards outside ebbing missourii enjoyed this well enough but i wouldnt say its something you should seek out,black_comedy
apart from good around ten minutes screen space involving conversation between ken and harry this movie sucks i just could not tolerate ray hopeless idiot making faces and behaving like a ten year old kid,black_comedy
i love i feel different because this film is very impressive with everything imagery acting,black_comedy
this is a great film the characters are brilliantly acted and written even the characters with little screen time have so much subtleties and mannerisms that i loved martin mcdonoughs first feature film and a great one at that it will have you thinking about it days after you finish itif you mostly watch big budget action movies which is fine theres no shame in it and you havent seen many other types of movies i would highly recommend you see this or if you just love film in general check it out on youtube someone literally uploaded the entire thing just watch it now what your doing isnt more important ya dickhead,black_comedy
has a lot of glowing reviews and an average rating that puts it up with the some of the best films of 2008 but i cant say i share the same enthusiasm for it firstly even though dark humour is usually my thing i didnt think was particularly funny the constant crude language especially from farrells character was more irritating than humorous and didnt feel natural at all and neither did the characters constant whingingthe second half of is a lot better than the dull and directionless first half in which the two characters do little more than wonder around the city complaining about anything and everything at least we get some action in the second half though it only partly recovers what it a disappointing spectacle isnt bad once it finally gets going and the humour will probably appeal to some people but i was disappointed,black_comedy
its hard for me to start reviewing this movie and i actually dont think i can explain why i give this a 10 but i will sure as hell trythe first time i saw this movie i was delighted 8 out of 10 entertaining strong and funny i was delighted at the originality but still theres not so much of it that the movie becomes only watchable for the specially interested i am not that type of person after all it got the basics down and down hard for what makes a good movie a good intriguing introduction a problem that needs solvingcomes perhaps a bit late characters you like and can sympathize with a steady buildupdrama curve until the end very welcoming visual display camera work a powerful finish and magnificent music all the way but this alone doesnt make it reach the very top there are a few other movies that delivers that too somehow i liked it more than i was aware of at first and so i had to watch it again and again and againwhat puts this movie over the top for me i think is the incredibly entertaining humorous and mind puzzling dialogue that will make you think that would be so cool to actually say to someone in real life or the kind of opposite what a horrible thing to say to someone the dialogue script for this movie is brilliant and it invites emotions on so many levels it took me several viewings to appreciate it at the level i do now but please dont be scared off this is still a kick as movie regardless of how many times you watch it its probably just me thats a bit slowalong with the dialogue the characters performing them is what makes this movie rewatchable  a trait not many movies have today in my opinion they will bring up those emotions and that intrigue and sell it to you over and over again and if that isnt good enough did i mention magnificent music and imagery did i say humor i believe it to more but i cant put my finger on it you cannot make a mistake by putting this on and i am betting my entire integrity as someone with a often way too critical mind towards movies never having given out a 10 before that this deserves so much more praise than it has gotten and it has gotten quite a bit i have my suspicions that the simple plot description of the movie makes people think they are gonna watch an action shooter and the simple minded gets disappointed which could explain the only 79 rating so know this while it has minor elements of action in it this is not an action movie its a masterpiece of characters and dramaemotions acting integrity humor and fking inanimate objects and if you have not seen it you got yourself a gem to discover this has been the goto movie for me when i ask friends hey have you seen this one because it has against all odds escaped the radar of the major crowd i leave you with this i have not yet showed it to anyone who didnt directly thank me afterwards,black_comedy
this would be my number one movie i know i knowhow can you choose one movie above all others yes its difficult to pick a favorite from each genre even let alone mix and match genres an pick an ultimate winner from the whole pilebut i did say if a gun were put to my head and a gun could be put to my head anytime anywhere sitting on a park bench in a childrens playground evenof all the movies ive seen and ive seen lots in 50 plus years this is the leanest no fleshing out no padding every frame has a purpose every word uttered has a meaning ive viewed quite a few of my favorite movies more than once and on repeated viewings theres always a scene or a line of dialogue i notice which could have been better or omitted even but not here and ive seen this movie a lotive read a review where the reviewer accuses the movie of being homophobic rubbish this movie treats everyone equallyeveryone gets hammered irish english belgian dutch american canadian homosexuals prostitutes hitmen midgetseveryone and if you treat everyone equally how can you be accused of being biasedgleeson is perfection as always could he be otherwise ditto fiennes but the one who pulled out all the stops and was brilliant throughout was colin farrell i simply didnt think he had a performance as good as this in him i was wrongwhen i saw this movie initially i thought to myself martin mcdonagh youre in deep st i mean how can he follow that up whatever comes next is bound to be inferior and i was proved righthe should have just packed his bags found a cave somewhere and became a hermit because following was going to prove impossible funnily enough his brother had the same problem following on from the excellent but not in this league the guard with that horrific mess that was calvary so why is that that 2nd album syndrome i have a theory its time on the first film they have loads of time time to write rewrite check and recheck add bits throw out bits over months maybe years until its perfect in their eyes at least but then it comes out and and another idea has to be found and a script and the studio is putting pressure on so corners are cut and scripts arent redrafted as they needed to be and  and thats my theory anywaybut thats beside the point this film is a cinematic masterpiece if you havent seen ityou just gotta unless you happen to be a gay midget hitman from belgium of irishamerican and englishcanadian parentage then theres a chance you may be offended,black_comedy
i have never been to belgium i have never wanted to go to belgium however after seeing brendan gleeson ken and colin farrell ray explore and then engage in a series of violent incidents all over the gorgeous medieval city of bruges it has suddenly moved near the top of my mustsee list in europethe very fact that even after seeing a body tumble out of a clock tower and fall in a bloody squelch on the cobblestones the idea of climbing the clock tower still remains appealing speaks to brugess beauty the movie itself is a journey through both the city as well as the depth of human guilt and depravity it includes romance and action humor and tragedyit definitely has its faults the sequencing of gun fights near the end seemed to be built around what was convenient for the plot not what would actually make any sense it is however a welldone movie overall and one that deserves to be seen by more than just people on the train to brugesi saw this on june 28 2017,black_comedy
id not heard about this movie until i accidentally read about it online and decided to give it a try ten minutes into the movie i was already curious despite the fact that i had a hard time with understanding all the words especially when the characters were cursing each other in high speeds but it is a movie with colorful characters it is funny mysterious scary sweet violent and even romantic at times the ending  well youve got to see it but let me just say that it is somewhat unpredictable,black_comedy
to be fair im not exactly watching this movie anymore its just playing in the background its so boring i lost interest about 25 minutes into itwere waiting around with the two hit men whose mission apparently seems to be to see bruges one of these men falls head over heels in love with an averagelooking woman whom he somehow for inexplicable reasons finds absolutely stunning this man also happens to have low selfesteem which is so typical of a bad guy i dont know what im watching i read something about the writing being supposedly good and there was quite a bit of hype about this movie but thats obviously all it was hype,black_comedy
im not gonna get into too much detail about how the movie panned out for me cutting the long story shortim utterly gutted after watching this movie and only wished if i could turn the clock back and did something worthwhile initially when i read the plot summary over the top reviews particularly from the critics wont say the users cause theyve no sense of good movies whatsoever anything that is hyperpraised highrated blah blah automatically convinces their mind to be of a quality i was very much intrigued more than ive been lately before watching anythingright from the start till the first half of the movie the movie was very slowpaced bland and uninteresting with mediocre acting plus lame humors and boy colin farrell was terrible every dialogue coming from his mouth with annoying facial expressions had me yawning from time to timei just cant fathom why he received an award for such an awful performance instead brendan gleeson shouldve got it the only good thing i got to witness was the wonderful looking bruges city although the second half of the movie was good to be honest in contrast to the firstbut just wasnt good enough to compensate for my already disappointed mood,black_comedy
well everybody fuss about the new star my stepdaughter getting her baccalaureate in theater critics couple of days ago was appraising the author and convinced me to watch this in 2008 when the film was released ive heard the name but it passed me so i thought this time ill definitely watch it to be true ive could well be done without recalling guy ritchies films ive at least laughed watching them this one left me absolutely idle i am becoming old perhaps but tiny surface emotions dont touch even with great dose of irishness brilliant actors and a lot of senseless shooting strong bloody violence pervasive language and some drug use rated this with a 2 just because of some compassion though could put a rightful 1 mark,black_comedy
i think this is my first review on imdb but some of the comments i read have provoked me i havent even seen the end yet but after watching the kingsman and eddie the eagle last night i have to say it is lovely to see so many good films in english or even irish english im half irish half irish working in china and thoroughly enjoying this on my pc it makes me wonder if the yanks get our dark underdog humour on our little great islands i dont want to sound antiamerican but with trump and clinton running for president they must have some sort of sense of humour humour spelled correctly with a u as in u arseh0lesyes imdb i know this will never be seen i just wanted to vent my spleen,black_comedy
if you like your comedy dark as in pitch black tar dark then is for you brendan gleeson and colin farrell are an unlikely pair of hit men hiding out in the titular quaint belgian hamlet after a job gone horrifically awry and while gleeson plays against his standard surly sort as he kills em with kindness and farrell is a riot as a shampoo for brains shooter this odd and ominous story didnt ultimately come together as id hoped it might there were moments of laugh out loud levity and then there were scenes of malicious mayhem and deep despondency alas the jarring juxtaposition of this deviant divergence just didnt jive in the end to fully satisfystill in keeping with the sardonic underpinning of let us all be clear shall we its dwarf got it dwarf,black_comedy
is a terrific example of how to properly make a crime thriller mixed with dark humor its a very fine line to walk and its very difficult not to cross that line so when this type of film is pulled off successfully it deserves some major credit colin farrell and brendan gleeson have awesome chemistry together brendan gleeson always tries to look at things positively and he is met with colin farrells amazingly negative and funny responses the beginning of the film is a tad slow but once it picks up it grabs you and never lets you go i was surprised by how much i actually ended up liking it overall i though this film was great and i say go see it,black_comedy
i started watching this with my usual scepticism probably yet another brit gangster movie attempting to tread where much better has gpne before i thought well not in such words but that sums up my expectationi soon realised how far from the case this is the movie is quite original the characters are compelling the script is of that quality you do not notice because it seems totally natural the acting from the trio of leads is of course excellent but also from the unfamiliar supporting cast the originality really hit with the contrast between the almost carry on characters and the realisation of what they do and one of them has done not depicted flippantly as in the typical crimeland flick but with cold honestythis dissonance between comical absurdity and moral darkness is shocking and disorientating it is the main force in the story it isnt a flash in the pan either but is developed cunningly as the ethical maze of arguments actions intentions and jumbled consequences unfoldstruly this is a movie that is both comical and yet philosophically profound within the ambit of complete realism just one scene on its own poses a question most of us will never before have considered can a mans moral debts be paid by the taking of his life without that being by his own hand if that puzzles you just watch the movieof course no movie is perfect one thing that slightly diminishes the freshness of the movie is that fiennes character tends to remind one of that played by ben kingsley in sexy beast in fact his manner of speech seems almost identical nonetheless it works in context and as with other aspects of the movie produces both comedy and profundity i think the appearance of movie extras echoing the visions of bosch could have been bolder one characters ultimate leap was the one thing a bit farfetched not because he would not have attempted it but in that it worked out as intended on the other hand the way the loose change used in that scene was primed in our thoughts earlier was maybe the best example of this technique ive ever noticedi was staggered to discover that this was the directors first full piece,black_comedy
i will probably lie awake tonight laughing at all of comedic gems martin mcdonaghs whipsharp hitman comedy is one of the most rewarding films ive ever invested time in the film unites colin farrell brendan gleeson and ralph fiennes  three of the most talented and underappreciated actors the uk has working today  and produces amazing work from all three does a fantastic job balancing the drama with the comedic remembering to be sombre but never forgetting to lighten the mood the jokes are sharp and blunt delivered flawlessly by the trio of lead men and also by the lovely clmence posy an underrated treat in herself pc police will find plenty to complain about here but as brendan gleeson would tell themwell he says it bettergleeson and farell share chemistry and barbed wordplay with the skill that pulp fiction wowed us with back in 1994 i was invested in these characters and in their story and most importantly i laughed long and hard throughout the entire movie an underrated gem and what a pleasure it was to discover,black_comedy
yes only few movies i wrote reviews about and among those few only very very few i gave above 7 ratings and is among very very few watched it several times and realized that i had to review this beautiful movie which in short span capture the essence of humanity guilt emotions friendship and humor i could go and on and write 10 pages but those 10 pages would be just repetitive of most of the 400 plus comments which already written about this movie excellent and outstanding performance by colin farrell he surpassed his london boulevard performance in this movie brendan gleeson one of the memorable work short but the integral part done by ralph fiennes exceed expectations supported well by other actors the way martin mcdonagh captured the sleeping and pristine beauty of bruges with background of intense story was simply outstandingeven midgets were funny and brilliant,black_comedy
the titanic international film festival budapests new tough guy on the block and the only real rival to the annual hungarian film week magyar filmszmele for the attention of the large film buff community here closed shop on april 13 2009 with the screening of a spellbinding new irish thriller and a closing gala party that lasted far into the nightthe closing film was another eyeopener directed by martin mcdonagh and set almost entirely in the beautiful belgian canal city of bruges this is one where its hard to tell whether its a violent comedy or a spoof on violence or a comical violence film about two hardboiled irish hit men on the lam in belgium our hero handsome irish charmer colin farrell sporting a heavy growth of fiveoclock shadow throughout and constantly lamenting the fact that he accidentally killed a little boy is not above punching out a lady in a restaurant or karate chopping a poor midget who gets on his nerves other than that hes quite lovable ralph fiennes the onetime english patient comes in for possibly the most brutal role hes ever played as the obsessed vengeful father of the departed lad and irish actor brendan gleeson a veteran of the harry potter films is also quite charming as the avuncular partner in crime of young farrell guns galore and drugs like cocaine and lsd are taken for granted in this colorful criminal saga and the city of bruge itself is shown in its full glory day and night the music incidentally is extremely subtle with a quiet piano playing soothingly in the background of some of the most violent scenes very good music in its own right and compliments to composer carter burwell who does the music for all coen brothers flicks among others winding up with a breathtaking chase through the cobblestone streets of bruges at night and a shootout on the canal literally leaves you gasping for breath and needing a drink and realizing that whatever it was about you just had one helluva romp and laughed a lot the perfect bookend for a modest film festival in a major easteuropean capital,black_comedy
i hate films that use midgets to make a point its something about midgetsthis is pretty good although the absence of laughs felt awkwardwhats with colin farrells eyebrows like windwipers with a jammed motori would have enjoyed the contrast between his character and gleesons if they both had different philosophies so the scene in the blood chapel was the crucial bit but there was nothing outside their selfish concernsi thought bruges  brueghel would inform the characters maybe set a pattern for them to break but the actors just reacted to each other like father and sonthe love interest was pointless the filmwithin had potential but it just served what turned out to be a melodrama fiennes was good as an eastend gangster but the best performer was luke kelly belltower scene  on raglan road on an autumn day i met her first and knew that her dark hair would weave a snare that i might one day rue i saw the danger yet i walked along the enchanted way and i said let grief be a fallen leaf at the dawning of the day,black_comedy
this movie had me in tears from laughter i had absolutely no expectations going into this and didnt expect to laugh half as much as i did colin farrell is brilliant as the notsosmart thug his dialog and facial expressions provide much of the comedy in this filmthe setting  bruges belgium  makes for quaint and romantic scenery somewhat at odds with the brutish storyline which only adds to the quirk brendan gleeson is classic as always fueling the comedic fires even when they burn blackthis film exceeded all my expectations and is definitely up there with guy ritchie films like snatch like those films though you might need subtitles even if youre an english speaker given those thick irish accents,black_comedy
if you hate colin farrell this will make you think otherwise rarely a movie tickles your funny bone and then makes you all gloomy at the same time and thats what differentiates from other movies great direction brilliant cinematography and some amazing work from the lead actors make the movie a delight to watch something youre not gonna regret after you are done with itthe movie uncovers as a slow touristic dedication to the canalbased city of bruges unraveling its medieval architecture old buildings and sort of sombre milieu and gently turns out into a dark thriller something you would never expect from it the chemistry between farrell and gleeson gives comic color to the first half from which the movie grows to become even more shadier with the advent of ralph fiennes who is funny in his own evil waycontrary to what a lot of people say i really liked the ending it was definitely unexpected and probably a cleaner way to end a dark comedy like this one i would suggest this to all kinds of audience just so that people know that this too is a way one can tell a story,black_comedy
bruges the most wellpreserved medieval city in the whole of belgium is a welcoming destination for travelers from all over the world but for hit men ray and ken it could be their final destination a difficult job has resulted in the pair being ordered right before christmas by their london boss harry to go and cool their heels in the storybook flemish city for a couple of weeks very much out of place amidst the gothic architecture canals and cobbled streets the two hit men fill their days living the lives of tourists ray still haunted by the bloodshed in london hates the place while ken even as he keeps a fatherly eye on rays often profanely funny exploits finds his mind and soul being expanded by the beauty and serenity of the city but the longer they stay waiting for harrys call the more surreal their experience becomes as they find themselves in weird encounters with locals tourists violent medieval art a dwarf american actor shooting a european art film dutch prostitutes and a potential romance for ray in the form of chlo who may have some dark secrets of her own and when the call from harry does finally come ken and rays vacation becomes a lifeanddeath struggle of darkly comic proportions and surprisingly emotional consequences,black_comedy
stars colin farrell and brendan gleeson as two hit men ray and ken who are sent to bruges after a job gone terribly wrongthe story was great and it kept me interested and entertained until the very end the dialogue between all the characters were funny and witty the characters and their interactions with each other were great especially the interactions between ray and ken and with their ruthless boss played by ralph fiennes the acting from the cast was great as welli had great fun watching this movie the comedic moments of the movie was funny and the emotional moments were emotional the ending was great more so when remembering a line spoken earlier by ralph fiennes character to gleesons character,black_comedy
is intended to be a comedy but moreso a dark comedy however i didnt find it funny it never occurred to me to laugh or chuckle or even smile the dialog can be clever and witty but nothing gave the sense to laugh the chemistry between the leads are good as it makes it somewhat interesting but overall suffers and feels all over the placea plot hole near the end occurs when a guy gets shot in the carotid artery he still has enough blood and energy left to climb up a bunch of steps and jump out of a window 250 feet high after he lands on his head squishing on the ground like a tomato he still can talk and give instructions before he says i think im going to die now on the positive side it is filmed on location which is the most wellpreserved medieval city in all of belgium the sites are beautiful but i wasnt blown away by the cinematography perhaps a second watch could renew my thoughts,black_comedy
before i sat down to watch this movie i expected it to be okay but i was quite wrong is a well constructed film with great comedy dark crime and good drama starting off with the story i really like it when a movie tells the prologue throughout the movie giving you more clues and never telling you exactly what happened the structure was fine and the whole movie was rushed or stretched the writer managed to blend the action and drama together to create a film just right in length and tone onto characters throughout the 1st and 2nd act of the movie we see the bond between our two main characters build and by the third we see them fallout and a situation follows that i wont spoil onto directing the scenes where we just got to look at bruges was just perfect every angle just matched up with the scene i really felt the connection to the movie deserves praise for its efforts it may not be the perfect movie but it certainly a movie worth watching it receives an 810,black_comedy
i had great time while i was watchin this moviethe film was outstanding i loved storyline performance of the cast and bruges of course farrell was funny and charismatic all the time farrell was so sweet as he was expressing that he hates bruges he was very attractive with glasses he had a role just like he had in woody allens cassandras dream a man who regrets what he did and is therefore depressed i believe he succeeded in playing this role in both movies bruges was the right choice as city i couldnt decide if the city was more attractive or farrell the beautiful homes and buildings peaceful roads and magnificent canals of this historical city affected me storyline was very good two hit men come to bruges to lie low after botched job they stay in such a warm hotel they discover the city one of them is ordered to do sth he doesnt want to farrell finds love in this magical city,black_comedy
is a british black comedy film directed by martin mcdonagh released in 2008 it follows a pair of hit men named ken and ray who are hiding out in the belgian town of bruges after ray accidentally murders a child during one of his jobs i found this film pretty entertaining throughout it had clever witty dialogue which conveyed both characters very well the characters themselves are very convincing and both very 3 dimensional the relationship between them both is presented very well as it shows their closeness and shows their emotion despite having a seemingly emotionless job i thought the dialogue and acting was extremely credible to farrell as he perfectly conveys rays fragile state of mind and presents his character differently to how youd expect the story itself was pretty basic but well written and perhaps the only part of the film that let it down was the ending which i was not fully satisfied with i feel like it was a little unconvincing and unrealistic with there being a shootout in the middle of a film set and no one seems to take any action and prefers to carry on with their business i think this was a bit of a silly sequence and although the fate of the characters was relatively appropriate i still feel it wasnt authentic enough this film was set in a beautiful location and when it isnt making you laugh or wince it instils emotion into the viewer with its stunning soundtrack and appropriate cinematography the cinematography was very revealing for the characters and shows off the setting of the film extremely well it also intensifies the dialogue and importance of scenes the editing of the narrative was quite clever and i liked how we found out what ray had done after he sees two children walking with their parents it was an appropriate link and therefore a good time to reveal rays actions,black_comedy
i think 2 should be made now what i am thinking is you could go back in time when harry was young and went to bruges for the 1st time and of course did we hear ken had ever been to bruges before as it did seem he had worked for harry for a long time yuri could of course have been around as it also did seem harry knew him also colin farrell could well of survived so you could cut back from 1994 time to 2014 time this time ray could be working for another gangster and this time he has got to go back to bruges to kill someone else having been to bruges twice last year like martin mcdonagh did i have loads of ideas its a brilliant place and i have loads of stories from my time there last year brilliant 1st film brilliant location can a 2nd film be done just as well,black_comedy
a remarkable irish film filled with lots of comedy absolutely dark bruges is a beautiful city of belgium absolutely magnificent in its beauty the architecture and art is just greatis a simple storytelling of a defect assassin who is not only placed on vacation one who does not like art will not enjoy any sight seeing well its portrayed on rays expression when ken decides to visit placesexcellent film that you should watch if you have notstory encircles around irish contract assassins ray colin farrell and ken brendan gleeson are sent to belgium city of and told to wait for further instructions from their foulmouthed employer harry waters ralph fienneswhile ken takes a stroll to visit historical and medieval buildings with ray feeling guiltstricken over an accidental murder of a childone night while observing a film shoot with the dwarf actor jimmy jordan prentice ray stalked and made love with chlo clmence posy a local drug dealer and a production assistantken received a call from harry and the order was to assassinate ray but he is reluctant to do so until he saw ray tried to put a bullet to his own head then ken stopped ray from killing himself and told him about harry and decided to let ray goken purchased a train ticket for ray to leave belgium but feeling worried over ken knowing that harry will have to shoot ken for dismissing him ray returns to bruges only to be arrested by the local police for assaulting the canadian touristthen the chase between harry ken and ray began ken was caught by harry at the belfry before shooting him and pushing him down to his death from the highest floor harry spotted ray belowthe dwarf actor jimmy was along the way and was shot harry has a good principle when it involves children but mistaken the dwarf actor as a child  that he shot ray and then put a bullet to his brainsray was seen inside the ambulance with chlo calling to him until he fade to black,black_comedy
is perhaps the funniest and also the smartest comedy film that came out in 2008 and without a doubts the best comedy film of the last decade the cinematography is fantastic widely superior than your conventional comedy film the shots from bruges are just incredible and breath taking stunning as well is the music composed by carter buwell fine tracks which fits well into the films atmospherethe plot is also very peculiar it has some dramatic and silly moments and i must say that it dont has a perfect balance between the extremes and it suddenly may go from suicide sequences to a discussion about a war between black dwarfs and white dwarfs its crazy this probably was the intention of the author mixing greek tragedy with the extremely silly and comic situations its weird and it worked absolutely workedand as said previously is a very smart film the plot has a very deep content and explores in a fine way subjects as the religiosity and will to live will to live in fact is what moves this film its possible to see the irony in the events this film presents such as the fact that when farrels character wants to die he is completely safe but when he finally is dying he starts to will his life this irony in fact is what makes this film so great in my opinion forget all the idiocy of the characters the tragedy aspects and the fact that it is a well made film technically this film is great because of the irony the irony of the life fantastic and of course colin did pretty well his here and deservedly won the golden globe for his effort the entire cast did well including the racist dwarfa must watch film 9510,black_comedy
what i meant with the title was that sometimes we watch some movies that dont seem to have anything special about them i cant exactly say what i liked about this movie maybe it was kens devotion toward this boy who made a bad call but had the rest of his life to make up for it or the casual conversations between two killers with honor who respected each other but had to stay true to their principles there was certainly a lot of scenes i will not forget anytime soon colin portrayed the naivety of his character quite convincingly and made an usually unlikable person quite fun to watch its the kind of movie that makes you forget what is right or wrong for you and makes you see things from the characters prospective its filled with subtle humor and a rare gem i was very happy to discover,black_comedy
ray colin farrell and ken brendan gleeson in this movie might be seen as a mordant response to the tarantinos pairing of vincent john travolta and jules samuel l jacksonin pulp fiction two mismatched hoodlums more emotionally attached to each other than they initially suspectthe story of becomes more surreal as it moves to its climax a progression that for me doesnt quite come off  perhaps it needed more swirling mists and arty camera work a little earlier than the writerdirector opted for but this slight misjudgment doesnt ultimately detract from a hilarious script and excellent performancesspecial mention to carter burwell another superb score,black_comedy
the hitman ray in this film was contracted to murder a priest he even gives regards from his boss the contractor harry as he does the hit the priest is obviously familiar with harry one can only wonder if that priest had molested young harry now intent on vengeance the young boy accidentally shot alone at night in a church is too reminiscent of a situation that could lead to such molestation did harry now an assassination contractor turn to crime because of the crisis he suffered as a young boy in church i got the feeling that the screen writer is critical of the church the scene in the church that owned a vessel containing some of jesuss blood seemed critical of such beliefs even satirical how could a crusader find the blood of jesus 1000 years after his death in fairness the satire is spread in all directions hit men have principles too a hitman who kills an innocent child must die harry thinks he has killed a child in his process of his vendetta this child is actually a dwarf none the less harry must be true to his own values and punishes himselfthe film laughs at everyone and everything it is truly entertaining so it has its own morality,black_comedy
is a masterful dark comedy mixed with elements of an excellent crime thriller and together those two genres created a cinematic gem it seems like british films are increasingly getting better or i should say more abstract than hollywood films im not convinced that an american studio would make a film like this this film has some sharp witty dialog and it proves to be effective especially during the bantering of colin farrell and brendan gleesonmartin mcdonaghs film is about two hit men who are sent to bruges to cool things off after a failed hit attempt but things go awry when the crime boss comes to town to settle thingsthe acting is very good i think colin farrell is underrated but this film shows he has the makings to be a bonafide star his sharp turns and the way he gives his dialog is very memorable he and gleeson have absolutely one hundred percent chemistry with each other ralph fiennes makes a great baddie as we know because of his role as voldemort in the harry potter films but hes not entirely bad and i love to see that in a bad guyoverall this is a dark comedy that has a little bit of everything it has thrilling moments some action comedy a little bit of romance and some blood it also can be classified as a satire and a witty one too it has a very memorable screenplay and is one of the best of 2008 i knew this would be a good film and im glad i was not disappointed i rate this film 1010,black_comedy
instantly became one of my 25 favorite films after watching it for the first time pretty amazing considering is was irishenglish playwright martin mcdonaghs first feature film im not sure how he got such a great cast for this  having been relatively unknown in american cinema until this point but brendan gleeson and colin farrell have incredible chemistry on camera this being juxtaposed to the seldom sympathetic ralph fiennesalthough always risky to intertwine humor with such a heavy story mcdonagh spun a perfectly cerebral dark comedy revolving around a pair of hit men sent to bruges after a hit gone badly although the film is quirky and subtly hilarious at times the strength of the film lies in the organic dialogue and powerful philosophicalpsychological struggle of colin farrells character as he questions his value his goodness and the purpose all the while,black_comedy
really is one of the best movies ive seen for years it made me laugh has some exciting sad nostalgic and magic moments the city is awesome ive been there twice and is the best place to make a film like this colin farrell ralph fiennes and brendan gleeson were the best cast that had to be chosen for this film you dont need explosions and computer effects to do an old fashioned masterpiece like this this film contains everything you need to get entertained bad language very black sense of humor wellfed action sequences and a portrait of a magical place called bruges cast  crew did an amazing job,black_comedy
a superb quirk of a film that felt like an adaptation of a very good short storyi expected a macho gangster heist with crappy dialogue and a transparent plot  not at all what was delivered sure its gruesome in places but it has got brains heart and some fantastic dialogue it is hard to fault this filmthis film was on my watchlist as it always appeared under other people who liked this also liked i kept looking at it thinking it looked a bit odd but meaning to get round to watching it so glad i finally did if you are in the same position just try it,black_comedy
bruges its in belgium and after a job gone wrong two irish hitmen ken and ray are sent there to hide out their boss loves the place calling it a fairytale town ken becomes a happy tourist embracing the chance to explore the bestpreserved medieval city in belgium ray is not happy he wants out of bruges from the moment he gets there touring a medieval city is not his thing and it also becomes very quickly obvious that ray is tormented by something the film is very smart in waiting to reveal exactly what it is that is weighing so heavily on rays mind when all is revealed a new spin is put on things the story which to that point had seemed to be an odd couple comedy takes an emotional turn but the film never stops giving you plenty to laugh at and when ken and rays boss reveals exactly why he sent them to bruges the film turns again giving us some action drama and real suspense but still laughs too always laughs the film has serious elements but at heart its always a comedy a very dark comedy and a very good onemuch of the credit for the films success has to go to the actors portraying ken and ray brendan gleeson is perfect as ken the older and wiser of the pair and colin farrell is excellent as young hothead ray farrell is hilarious in rays biting exchanges with ken about the merits or lack thereof of bruges but farrell also nails the serious emotional side of the character gleeson and farrell really do make for the perfect screen pairing it helps that they have a great script to work with writerdirector martin mcdonagh providing them with plenty of hilarious dialogue all along the way the starring pair are also ably supported by some other performers ken and rays boss is not revealed until well into the picture and when he arrives things really kick up a notch this guy is explosive and in his own unique way hilarious theres a woman involved shes about the only thing which ray finds appealing oh theres also a cocainesnorting racist dwarf with an affinity for hookersin this film the city of bruges itself is just as important a character as any of the people what a lovely city and director mcdonagh shows it off beautifully it may not be rays thing but chances are youll want to visit the place after seeing the film and youll probably want to see the film another time or two as well its a dark comedy which gives you plenty of laughs but it has a great deal of heart as well and some good action too its wonderfully scripted performed perfectly by a great cast and it looks spectacular well done by all involved,black_comedy
is a great movie with a terrific story linean outstanding castgreat characterssome very funny scenes and plenty of violencemartin mcdonagh does a great job with this movie as usual and colin farrell and brendan gleesons performances are incredibly goodif you enjoyed this moviei would definitely recommend you see martin mcdonaghs most recent filmseven psychopathsalso starring colin farrell in the main roleyou will definitely love it if you lovedray colin farrell and ken brendan gleeson are sent to bruges in belgium after an illegal job goes wrongbut ray wants nothing more than to get away from bruges,black_comedy
both colin farrell and brendan gleeson were very good in their roles also the pictures from bruge were awesome like a fairytale at the beginning it was nice that there were two people doing sightseeing without purpose but in the same time knowing that something strange is going to happen it would be better if we had an idea about the relationship of the two contract killers before their first common job went wrong something from their pastafter a while the plot was expected and along with some excesses on the way people died and the shootouts which i didnt find funny if that was the purpose of the director were the two main elements i didnt like at the moviei was expecting i do not strongly recommend the movie but its worth watching if you like action with some smart dialogs and a bit of english humor,black_comedy
before i saw i was under the impressions itd be a black comedy now i respect farrell as an actor and enjoyed dark humor comedy i definitely went into this without any expectations really just to enjoy its humor however you quickly come to realize its much more than that sure its humours very good writing might i add but it has far more depth than i expected by the end of the film i was completely blown away acting is emotional and excellent farrell shows his diversity as an actor and i thoroughly enjoyed ralph fiennes character as well the writing is some of the best ive ever seen the script is filled with deep threedimensional characters a must see,black_comedy
playwright martin mcdonagh makes an assured feature filmmaking debut with this witty and generally amusing combination of dark comedy sobering drama crime picture and travelogue the bruges of the title is a belgian city with a real storybook quality and which is a magnet for the tourist trade hit men ray colin farrell and ken brendan gleeson have been sent there on orders from their boss harry ralph fiennes after a job has been botched and a young boy accidentally killed theyre instructed to take in the sights  which ken is more than happy to do  while awaiting further orders but ray is grumpy and bored and thinks that spending time is like spending time in purgatory audiences accustomed to loud and fast action films may possibly find this to be just as dull as ray finds bruges but some may also consider this to be a rather interesting breath of fresh air its very dependent on character and situation and working from mcdonaghs script the three principal actors do excellent jobs creating well rounded individuals who may be in a morbid line of work but who each have their own moral code among the assorted episodes of the story ray romances a free spirited local named chloe clemence poesy makes the acquaintance of a dwarf named jimmy jordan prentice gets briefly menaced by chloes associate eirik jeremie renier roughs up a loud mouthed canadian guy  portrayed by zeljko ivanek and learns the truth about why he and ken were sent to bruges in the first place mcdonaghs dialogue is sometimes surprising and often quite funny he gives the material an impressively unpc flair there are spurts of bloody violence here and there but what the writer  director often sets out to do is actually subvert the conventions of typical crime gone wrong flicks even coming up with a way to avoid the kind of shootout one might normally see in this sort of thing beautiful photography and scenery are of course a credit to the film the city does become a character in its own right the music by carter burwell is superb at setting the mood the three leads are terrific with fiennes showing a winning aptitude for comedy and farrell and gleeson definitely managing to win our sympathies they help to make this nicely offbeat film worth seeking out for movie lovers who get tired of more formulaic fare recommended seven out of 10,black_comedy
i add my voice to those who were nicely surprised at how entertaining they found this movie i am not sure why but i was reminded of another movie hear my song whose plots are totally different but perhaps it was their styles  both took surprising and unexpected and strangely amusing twists but in the end their stories ended satisfactorily anyway i suspect my comments are confusing and unclear but in a way that is what you kind of experience with these filmsone curious thing about the end titles a fine actor who has a minor speaking role was not credited i suspect a clerical error because it makes no sense the wonderful actor is ciaran hinds,black_comedy
this one wasnt bad i read a lot of reviews that raved for this movie i dont think it was that great but it was still a relatively good comedydrama its got some good looking women hit men a even a midget or dwarf or little person depending on what you prefercolin farrel plays ray a hitman who travels with a fellow hitman ken brendan gleeson to bruges belgium to complete a job for their boss ralph fiennes harry ray completes the job but is grief stricken when he inadvertently makes a mistake taking out and innocent bystander now his friend and partner ken is tasked with a hit on ray choices need to be made and it takes both men through quite a mix of characters on the way to a conclusionit sounds like a pretty grim more action based drama but its not the comedy aspects are pretty good ala a good quentin tarantino and like his films is pretty dialog heavy but worth listening to there wasnt a lot of action in this one but it is a pretty smart funny and intelligent movie a 7 is the best i can give this one but a 7 for me is definitely worth a view,black_comedy
is a brilliant film colin farrell delivers an outstanding performance as ray a rookie hitman who is ordered to execute a priest but inadvertently kills a young boy in the process brendan gleeson plays an expert hitman named ken who is ordered to take ray to bruges and hide out until their boss played by ralph fiennes contacts them ken loves bruges but ray hates being there and constantly complains about the city if id grown up on a farm and was retarded bruges might impress me but i didnt so it doesnt this film is hilarious the script written by the brilliant martin mcdonagh is dark mature brilliant witty shocking and endlessly entertaining martin mcdonagh directs the film with an enormous amount of passion and feeling colin farrell delivers the performance of his career in the films cinematography is beautiful and perfectly captures the city in all of its living glory is of the best films i have ever seen,black_comedy
one of my favorite movies ever brendan gleeson is also one of my favorite actors and colin farrell is certainly growing on me as he gets older especially in humorous roles its nice to hear colin using his real voice instead of doing american accents note some folks in the us may have a hard time understanding some of the dialogue at low volumes and be prepared with the rewind button to catch whats being said as well as for the did he just say what i think he said moments i agree that the ending could have been handled better but please do not let that discourage you from seeing this wonderful picture the banter between ray and ken is worth the price of the movie alone add in ralph fiennes cursing in a way that would make a sailor blush the love interest chloe her idiot ex the gun dealer overly obsessed with dark corners  and the onagainoffagain friendship with a little person you have an intriguing and thoroughly entertaining movie smartly written dialogue and it is well worth your time i still get choked up while the irish dirge is playing during the bell tower scene,black_comedy
synopsis hit men ken brendan gleeson and ray colin farrell are banished to bruges belgium by their boss harry ralph fiennes to await further instruction after their latest job goes awry the timeout pushes both to reflect on their lives and their workquick take director martin mcdonagh does a remarkable job squeezing the most out of the location and the characters and manages to successfully craft a movie about assassins that focuses not on the action but on the people all the actors from the three male leads down to the supporting cast give spoton performances that are just the right amount of dour the right amount of sarcastic and dark and funny this isnt an action movie really there is no twist no whodunnit no car chase sequence no massive explosions as such it could come out dry to certain types of audiences but it certainly shouldnt be missed by those with an open mind looking for a quality treatwatch if you like characters one liners sarcastic remarks dark humor offbeat unpolitically correct references if you can live with it being stripped of adrenaline action scenes youll be rewarded with the fine performances of the actors and the directordont watch if the abovestated type of humor does not suit you and you are easily offended by certain kinds of remarks i wouldnt recommend this to people like my mom who have short attention spans and have no appreciation for dialogue if youre not going to mind whats being said and are relying on action and effects then this isnt for you,black_comedy
every once in a blue moon we get a genre movie with meaning and its even rarer to have it in equilibrium namely where the genre doesnt exceed the meaning or vice versa is one of those movies nevertheless the balance was partly just partly missedthe best about this movie was how it managed to be multidimensional outwardly its crime  black comedy it has not many of but nearly all the right stuff unique characters with several antics hot ping pong dialog engaging european backgrounds touchy even if short music sharpwitted pace and all perfect performances surprisingly colin farrell uncovers how creatively comedic he can be its impossible to pinpoint one downside in this casts work so it provides entertainment in its own dark tastethen inwardly its thoughtprovoking with philosophical dimension the haunting guilt is cleverly portrayed i loved the matter of whether jail or death was my fate i would welcome any of them all for ending the compunction and achieving the purgation and although death is all over the story it emphasizes the importance of life and love because with them maybe we may win penance second chance and some happinessnotice well the names of the characters they can be read metaphorically for instance ray is a hitman who did wrong yet has a beam of conscience ken meaning perceive or view suits the character as more experienced than his fellow ray the punisher is named harry which means attack or oblige and finally there is a hope in the future through the pregnant hotel owner whose name is marry maybe as a reference to the virgin mary wholl give birth to a new christ to guide and forgive the sinnersnot only this the movie has some sort of deep and wicked social  political point of view it shows a western world of decadence the irish the american the belgium people are presented as killers drug addicts drug dealers gun dealers prostitutes thieves racist depressed or suicidal lost souls the survivors of all that are the priest and the little boy however theyre not completely survivors because they were killed earlier so here we are facing a community of human filth that murdered its spiritual side the priest along with its innocence the little boy devoting itself to finish itself later unless there is a desire to purge bruges and purge are similar words arent they you may consider it another noir world but aside from meditative reading for the characters you cant miss the unmistakable irony between the tranquil solemn antiquities the old civilization and the boisterous destructive leads todays civilization as the grandfathers built the great high towers and the grandsons just fall over themcut to the missing balance issue and i mean nothing but the movies last 10 minutes after the moment of ralph fiennes getting out of the tower with his gun its all downhill from there look how logic takes a dive and sinks how the man who always sticks to his principles betrays those principles stupidly he said earlier that he wont shoot his target in front of 3000 belgium citizens now hes with a gun running after his target shooting him nonstop all over brugess streets in front of 4000 belgium citizens obviously it was a desire that scriptwriter  director martin mcdonagh had of filming a crazy action sequence a la hollywood or maybe the movie needed that to be sold since shootouts look good in any trailer of a movie especially this no action all talk moviethe oneeyed thief who was halfblinded by farrell runs into fiennes who arrived to kill the same farrell in the gun dealers home accidentally and in the same night that thief sees fiennes getting into the tower accidentally then sees farrell near the same place also accidentally  that was simply forced then the midget wears as a little boy stands right beside farrell while hes being killed takes a bullet in his head so his features may not be clear so mr isticktomyprinciples shoots himself for killing a kidall of that was tooooo forced to say the least it surely weakened the solid movie making its end no solid at allvarious bothering points  a line said by farrells character while his anger in the restaurant he pauses even though he should just hit the  and he repeats yes i am talking to you whats  unbelievable which was unbelievably intellectual for that character to say fitting more the mentality of an author or an actor or an author who wanted to express his own character through an actor  add to that naturally the lasting waterfall of the f words the blasphemy and some obnoxious violence these were points to hate more than to bother to tell you the truthis a genre movie that goes beyond the entertainment of its genre but exaggerating the portion of entertainment at the end harmed it hence it ends up as a movie about hitmen purgation and the contemporary western civilization however with chaotic madeup ending at any case hurray for that script if you watch many movies you have to appreciate it since it is not frequent to run into something like it very,black_comedy
what i liked about this movie was the photography of the city brugesit is quite beautiful both day and night scenes the acting of the main characters ken and ray was good i found myself feeling a bit of sympathy for them there were some scenes that had real comedy and i found myself laughing a couple of times i think the plot could have been better developed im not clear on what message the writer of the script was trying to set forth strangely this movie is staying in my mind so i think that is why i felt compelled to write this review what i disliked was the excessive violence there was too much blood and gore this could have been so much better the ending was a great disappointment,black_comedy
is the unlikely comedic drama that centers around two hitmen arriving belgium one hitman ray farrell is more for the party places and having a good time which means he isnt enjoying his time the other ken gleeson really enjoys bruges and urges ray to follow their bosses orders and lay low until theyre told otherwise but the story doesnt exactly kick into gear until harry fiennes comes to town and explaining why he kicks it into gear would be giving too much awayso if you know me you know that im not the biggest colin farrell fan he hasnt impressed me until now he was very surprising at first i thought he was doing his typical farrell thing where he looks completely out of place regardless of where he is but after 20 seconds i really thought he did his job well not only did i enjoy his performance but i am now looking forward to his performance in seven psychopaths as for the other leads in this movie gleeson and fiennes they both killed it for me this makes me want to see the guard just for gleesons performance and fiennes as always just knocks every single line out of the park even in the simplest of dialogue he made it seem so much more real the man can actand the one thing i had heard more than anything was how surprisingly funny it is and it kind of was i mean i wasnt nearly peeing my pants or anything but it was funny at times but that totally blinded me for what i found even more surprising the drama these characters ray especially were really deep and you could even sympathize with him i found myself nearly cheering for the characters there were also a surprising amount of moments where it was borderline sad that was one thing i wasnt expecting from this kind of film which means that when it pulled it off it takes it up a couple of pegs and yes as you can see from the headline i wasnt in love with this movie for the first 3045 thats the time where its just gleeson and farrell sightseeing there was some witty dialogue but i thought that it would kick it into gear a little faster i know it had to set up both its characters and story lines but i cant help but complain that it was too slow in the early going of the movie there were even some things that had nothing to do with the story at all farrells love interest despite being extremely hot had no real point of being there there was also the weird 2 minute spark between gleeson and the coowner of the hotel but before you think that i didnt enjoy this movie allow to talk about the last hour or so i cant talk specifics because that would give too much away for a film that really relies on being able to take the story anywhere but to give you a taste this is where fiennes finally appears despite being mentioned and hearing his voice he doesnt appear until the latter part and as i said before fiennes really does knock it out of the park which helps the second half of the film immensely the intensity is pumped up the real conflict isnt actually apparent until pretty late in the movie but it all works and the film delivers one of the greatest third acts ive ever seen in a movie knowing that martin mcdonagh was playwrite before this big screen debut makes sense now because there were parts where i thought man this feels like a play but in conclusion is a promising good time with a surprising amount of heartfelt moments you wont be disappointed with this debut b,black_comedy
billed as a black comedy this story of two stircrazy irish hit men on the lam in belgium could just as easily fall into any one of a dozen other genres with traces of humor suspense romance action and drama all stirred into the same bubbling pot the risk is certainly there for overexertion but the finished product doesnt fall short in any instance the comedy is sharply witty and welltimed the action fastpaced and fiery the romance heartfelt but not heavy colin farrell whose eyebrows migrate around his forehead like a pair of pitch black caterpillars on acid works a good range of emotions out of his fairly simple leading role and cleanly manages to get us rooting for him by the time the closing scenes roll around upon reflection there really isnt all that much to the story  its predictable at worst minimal at best  but there doesnt need to be,black_comedy
i liked some of the jokes and tourist view on bruges wanna visit bruges after seeing the movie but never will want to watch the movie again this is kind of my criteria after watching a movie or coming back from a performance i ask myself whether i want to see it again events flow in the movie is fairly slow and i think that it actually coincides with the flow of life this is what good about small cities in europe with just a few thousands of tourists well all bed men are dead at the end this is good from the moral point of view but i did not really get a little boy part im giving 5 out of 10,black_comedy
colin farrell and brendan gleason are a 2008 film directed by martin mcdonaghfarrell and gleason are ray and ken two hit men sent to bruges belgium to await instructions on their next hit from their boss yuri ralph fiennes ken gleason loves the fairytale prettiness and medieval sites of the town but farrell a volatile and troubled young man is bored out of his mind he perks up a little when he meets a pretty drug dealer and makes a date with her it gets to be kind of messy though when he takes offense at the restaurant and beats up a fellow patron and then at her place her boyfriendken is at the hotel to receive the call on the next hit and its on ray the boss was trying to show him a nice time in a pretty place before he dies the reason on his first hit which was in a church on a priest one of farrells bullets hit a child not only cant farrell recover from it but fiennes wants him gonethough this is a dark film it has a great deal of humor mostly provided by farrells excellent performance as the reckless ray the director mcdonagh has skillfully enmeshed both the comedy and the drama together and woven the idea of heaven hell and purgatory into the story for ken bruges is his idea of heaven peaceful and beautiful for ray since theyre stuck there for two weeks its purgatoryis a beautiful film about guilt camaraderie and the possibility of redemption its depressing but not completely and the scenery despite what ray thinks is beautiful,black_comedy
i was interested because the description in one or another source stated this was a comedy and with collin farrel i saw that having food potential turned out to be an interesting production indeed but it sure did not turn out to be a comedy a layer of occasional irony only overlays the localized slow paced grunge of troubled minds stuck in the cold grey bruges and their relationshipthe film successfully manages to turn an otherwise slow and uneventful setting into an interesting and in todays hollywood infected world a refreshing play basing itself largely on the interaction between the few players who star in it more than on the story or anything else its little gloomy quirks and twists make it a memorable movie still mentioned in the office years after its release but dont expect a hitman movie going into it as it is nothing like it,black_comedy
i love this movie martin mcdonagh is a genius who has written a brilliant script equally as good as fargo brendan gleeson and colin farrell are hit men on the run and in hiding due to a screws up on their last killing a scene with a priest and a confessional is worth the price of admission alone mcdonaghs sense of humor is wicked and the film gets stranger and strangerraycolin farrell has accidentally killed a boy and his catholic guilt resonates with him while his partner kenbrendan gleeson is happy go lucky and the complete opposite of his brooding friend after fighting with a canadien couple and subsequent legal problems they continue their colorful adventures in brutes dont miss this one,black_comedy
is a fairly simple and straight forward movie but how they go about things is quite delightfulits a movie about a couple of irish hit mencolin farrell and brendan gleeson are sent to belgium while things settle down on a hit that went wrong this is one of farrells best performances he tends to do better in smaller budget movies then the huge blockbusters he does in hollywood hes quite funny as the bored and antsy younger guy gleeson plays the older and more calm veteran hitman ralph fiennes plays their boss harry peter dinklage the 45 dwarf from games of thrones shows up here and is absolutely hilarious in his rolethe locations and scenery in the movie are absolutely enchanting,black_comedy
a film that reaches for both profound redemption drama and tarantinostyle comic banter and falls short on both accounts on the comic side there are maybe a few clever bits but most of it is stuff from the same old bag of gags with a few homophobic lines thrown in for good measure it fares slightly better with the drama although farrell who i cant stand looking at those freak eyebrows and tiny mouth its amazing i like the new world as much as i do doesnt really go through a transformation so much as he keeps shifting back and forth between dickhead and swell guy were asked to accept gleeson as the sage soulful elder hitman but even though i liked his performance the character feels manufactured also the ending is possibly the lamest example of dramatic irony ive ever seen you could almost hear mcdonagh quietly and smugly chuckling to himself as he thought of it the cinematography and score are pretty good and i really did enjoy gleeson but otherwise i didnt dig this very much,black_comedy
i watched this film expecting to see a brilliant dark comedy but i didnt find the jokes funny at all it was indeed dark but slow paced and halfway through i was thinking of giving this boring film just 5 starsbut then the story became very surreal and interesting i started to wonder if ray was already dead and bruges itself actually symbolised purgatory where good ken and evil harry were fighting for rays soulstill not sure what to make of this flick but i kinda like it now 710,black_comedy
bruges is a city full of middleaged buildings in belgium and that makes this place a wonderful choice for sightseeing however ray might not agree with that since he keeps describing this place as a xx hole and thats how the story begins two professional killers with no one to kill and no mission to accomplish which gives the most desperate condition you can imagine for a professional killer the scenario is full of black humor that makes the story almost like a fairy tale while there is obvious no happy ending of the story the most ironic thing is their over reacted behavior toward the accidental killing of the little girl considering the jobs they do is about killing all the time somehow it becomes unbearable when it comes to the little girl for what maybe its their remaining conscience or the socalled selfesteem this is just weird to see such sentimental professional killers but funny parts like ken saved ray from suicide the time he was supposed to kill him clearly described that all of them are not traditional killers but with merciful heartcolin farrells best achievement in acting the lovely accent incurably sentimental and great sense of humor made this extremely bizarre character yet adorable how strange that a professional killer appears so charming and compassionate and even stranger is that we all buy it after he actually finished his first assassination as to brendan gleeson all the jokes and funny stuff wouldnt be so convincing if its not for him and the jumping scene especially the jumping scene is when he stands out in the movie and makes unforgettable impressions to the audiences last but not least ralf fiennes plays his role like he always did struggling between friendship and morality not to mention his unshakable dignity for being a professional killer there is just too much fun to watch all the chemistry and jokes they have madethe most touching scene is no doubt the time when ken jumped off the tower to warn ray about his danger which made the most serious chapter of the story and leaves no debate about the reality in other words it just states that this is not joking for gods sake,black_comedy
this movie has lots of amazing lessons 1 shows how criminals can have conscience too and how far they can go to preserve their moral principles youve got to stick to your principles2 importance of being frank and honest about yourselves no hypocrisy noone lies about their profession even the prostitute the dwarf rejects kens compliment about his girlfriend3 how two people in the same profession can be so different ken and ray are interested in completely different thingsken in tourism and ray in midgets4 how biases can affect your life negatively ray was so biased against the city even before visiting that he couldnt enjoy the sights similarly the american tourists were so biased against ken because rob had called them elephants that they didnt heed to his advice not to visit the belltower and the guy had a heartattack5 importance of not imposing ones beliefs on others scene in church between ken and ray where ken is superexcited about the churchs artifact but ray just says do i have to see it6 actions have consequences ray has to get off the train for beating the canadian7 people like the belltower attendant are everywhere eg in government organizations strictly by the book and dont have any leeway for human exigenciescinematography is amazing music is amazing too a must watch,black_comedy
about 2 years ago i watched and commented on a belgian film called moscow belgium aanrijding in moscou it came to me out of the blue at a film festival and it pleased me so much in how different it was as a film experience somehow it was a film detached from conventions relatively away from the genre rules of that type of film at least hollywood rules but it had the appeal of the audiences and had it been spoken in english or spanish and it certainly might have had a different impact unpretentiousness was how i named my comment no i watch this film and it produces a similar effect and it takes place in belgium as well and because this one is spoken in english and has well known faces it falls in the sweet spot that i thought moscow might have fit in i wonder if belgium as a place has anything to do with thatnow this is quite a different film it has a very tight strong writing as controlled as the environment where the whole film takes place it all takes place within that environment and the first really interesting thing is how with one important exception all the important plot points that happen along the story are mapped into the places of the city that wed been introduced early when the hit men were simply sightseeing the tower the hotel the film set we get to the city with the characters and we see it through their eyes the fundamental plot point that is told to us through flashbacks is what allows for the story to derive into the other world of the noir genre where the film ends the killing of the child is what we learn what that fact does is to trigger all the events that make the characters meet what they are supposed to meet so the great thing here is how the film derives from genre to genre from the laws of comedy fing brugges to the point of hard men hunt the dramatic shift is subtle and really rare to watch and it magnifies the power of the endingthe crucial element that allows this is of course the film within the film being shot in brugges it intersects the narrative several times throughout the film and we even have actors from that film the midget interacting with our main actors the midget aspect is very talked about we pass through the set farrell even meets the girl on it and we are told the film has something to do with bosch and of course at the end the larger film the one were watching moves literally to the set of the inner film at the time when we no longer live in the comedy world and the two remaining characters meet their fate in a totally different dramatic world on the set of the inner film taking the midget with themthis is remarkable writing which nevertheless is only allowed by a solid direction which allows the actors to freely express under a controlled environmentmy opinion 45,black_comedy
this movie is so full of wittyfunny and original dialogues inventive and amusing performance and peaceful and medieval openair settingthis is in fact an attempt of making a dramaaction movie but it turned out to be a comical hilarious bizarre filmthe deaths give a touch of dramathoughit may not have very complex plot twists just because it doesnt need manyjames farrels so unique and unpredictable personality makes you want to repeat watching the film more than oncesometimes it resembles an immature kids behavioursometimes a crazylooking paranoid and dangerous guy some others a depressive and harmless as a kitty personi cant stop watching every face he shows every dialogue he gives and action he performsindeed he must have a 10stars performance awardbrendan gleeson has always played wiseexperienced menhe showed fascinated and interested by the culture and architecture of bruges throughout the movie and tried to influence his partner as well seen as a sad and sometimes boring person by himralph fiennes really looked irritatednot to mention pis off in this one and he is really suitable for that partto sum up i highly recommend this movie if you want to have a great time of fun and a hilarious experience,black_comedy
was not expecting much out of this movie but the high ratings on imdb convinced me to see it sure enough it was a winner a good combination of comedy action drama and even a little not very convincing romancethe two assassins make a hilarious duo as they take turns being alternately sentimental and tough guys there are some violent scenes it is a movie about assassins after all but its really more drama and comedy than actionsome aspects of the movie really stretch credibility though and unnecessarily the plot did not depend on the sloppiness the viewer is left wondering what the police in brugges are really up toall the murder and mayhem going on in the town square and even the many passersby barely seem to notice let alone the police but if you are willing to overlook credibility you will really need to at the oh come on give me a break climax its a fun couple of hours,black_comedy

to say the truth i was expecting something funnier not that the movie was bad or something it just haunted mecolin farrell was at his best he is just good the dialogs resembled tarantinos or guy richies scripts but they were original actually and what about the bruges its a fairy tale city for those who are looking for a feel good movie this is not the case go for something with luke wilson or jim carrey this movie is totally brutal it hurts in the end,black_comedy
a christmas story should one who killed a child be allowed to live harry waters a london thug sends irish hit men ken and ray to bruges to lie low after a job goes awry in a london church kens the old hand fascinated by the medieval with a fatherly attitude toward ray whos young and bored but chastened after the london job rays disposition changes when he meets chlo a hip young woman who sells drugs on the local set of a movie featuring jimmy an american dwarf harry calls with irrevocable instructions ken balks setting up a showdown in the town square a pregnant innkeeper dumdum bullets and a code of conduct play into the resolutionplaywright mcdonaughs debut feature can be described as a dramatic and violent black comedy and i have to admit the last time i laughed this much was when i saw role models2008 has to be one of the funniest films of the last years i didnt laugh until i cried but i did laugh constantly which means the film is very consistent and never looses direction ive seen some discussion in regards to the humor being either typically british or irish but honestly i couldnt care less it works and thats what matters colin farell plays the role of the young hitman ray while brendan gleeson is the optimistic and mature ken this comedic duo seems an odd match but it works marvelously colin farrel is exceptional as ray showing a different side as an actor he reaches comic heights that i never thought it could gleeson was satisfying but definitely outshined by farell and theres ralph fiennes who plays the creepy but hilarious harry an english thug the screenplay is full of irony and wit and the beautiful city of brugesbelgium serves as a background for all the crazy action is definitely worth seeing7510,black_comedy
i think playwrights tend to keep their theater chops even when trying to write something cinematic usually i dislike the effect  a static camera and a single setting  but for a film about two souls stuck in purgatory it works wellall three central characters are immersed in a morality not totally alien to convention but just slightly askew which mcdonagh matches nicely by creating a world thats slightly askew too ray ken and harry all acknowledge that the death of the child was wrong but the question preoccupying the film is how to atone for the sin  ray and harry are old testament eye for an eye guys ken is a new testament scion he believes in penance and potential for renewalharry and chloe are the gods of the story chloe in that she sells drugs to the film stars and then to the real stars her influence permeating both worlds providing the bridge between the two harry is the disembodied voice commanding and directing until ken defies him and he takes corporeal form in the third act its a n episodic film mainly in respect to harrys plot line which reinforces the fact that these souls are on a journeythe miniature pun intended film within the film is a great selfreferential touch  tom dicillo would be especially proud in the end the main players are appropriated by that film and the two worlds mergethe dialogue is melismatic and spicy and perfectly delivered by three topnotch performers,black_comedy
this is an excellent piece of work  with one big fault firstly this film is a brilliant study of the interaction between two very different characters superbly played by brendan gleeson and colin farrell brendan gleesons ken is by far the better character two characters who are united by only one thing  they are killers even being irish doesnt bring them closer to each other however as the plot develops they do bond and become almost like a comfortable married couple this forms the most and best part of the filmnow for the negative  ralph fiennes i couldnt believe how such a superb actor could have got his character so wrong he was wooden the acting was false and the character was so unbelievable i heard the voice on the phone and thought that was awful  but when i saw who it was i was shocked instead of being a believable tough gangland boss he came over as a poor parody of brick top in snatchoverall excellent acting well two out of three aint bad,black_comedy
i really enjoyed this movie right up until the very end one is not convinced that the last act of extreme violence would have been committed there are other implausibilities as well why would the beautiful belgian girl fall for one of the hit men so quickly and in spite of so much evidence that he is someone to stay away frombut the two hit men are so well played by gleason and farrell that one forgives almost anything they get pulled into various scenes that are absurd to the point of surrealism and draw you in quickly to the humor suspense or both that martin mcdonagh has written into themill be very interested in mcdonaghs next film,black_comedy
is a crime flick like so many in recent years that explore the lives and moral dilemmas of criminals in this case the film centres on two hit men holed up belgium after a hit gone wrong when it becomes apparent that someone is going to have to take the fall questions of right and wrong are raisedthe cast is a pretty good one with brendan gleeson  colin farrell working well together i give the edge to gleeson in the acting department but that may be because farrells character is rather unlikable at least initially ralph fiennes also turns in a good performance as their menacing boss and clmence posy amply supplies the eye candythe script is better than average but i wouldnt rank it alongside the best films of this type its got much of the same flavour but it just isnt as memorable overall the storyline is pretty satisfying though it surprises me to see this film classed as a comedythe technical side of things is ably handled but not particularly notablein the end this is a worthwhile film if youre looking for something along the lines of lock stock and two smoking barrels et al except with more depth while i think that this film lacks the indefinable spark that makes the best of those films appealing it is nevertheless a fairly unique spin on similar material,black_comedy
from the off this had the look and feel of a cult movie being neither an outandout comedy nor an action thriller i personally feel that this movie was mismarketed  however at least the pr machine made me want to watch it in the first place and im glad i did feeling like a cross between father ted and the bourne identity this is a beautifully shot film full of humour and pathos in equal measures its also the first film i can recall seeing where colin farrell isnt a huge disappointmentintroduces us to two irish hit men  childlike ray farrell and ken brendan gleeson who are ordered to lay low in belgium for two weeks after a job in london while awaiting further instructions from their boss harry ralph fiennes ken enjoys his time while ray cant wait to get out until he meets chlo clmence posy who is working on a film with dwarf actor jimmy jordan prentice but after botching a job and finding himself the target both ray and ken struggle to deal with the consequences of their actionsthere will be few who would argue that is anything original as it is rather reminiscent of a guy ritchie gangster flick as the characters and plot tangle with each other in unexpected ways the balance of humour and drama also matches ritchies output though due to heavy irish accents you sometimes struggle to hear all of the fabulously witty dialogue but does offer some crucial differences the biggest being farrell who produces the goods in a way i never expected he could he and gleeson exchange some brilliant dialogue as they come to terms with past mistakes and choices fiennes is also very good as the urbane killer with a family life and a potty mouth the other surprise is bruges itself looking every inch like the medieval dreamscape it feels like in the movie and provides not only a rich backdrop but also another character interacting with the actorshowever the plot itself is pretty standard gangster fare albeit set in belgium and there are still questions left at the end of the film but these dont distract you from what is an extremely good lowbudget movie that offers big dollops of laughs action and soulsearching amid a picturesque gothic town in belgium no doubt about it this is a difficult movie to pigeonhole and i know some people wholl watch this expecting something different and going home disappointed probably the film closest to this in feel and style is the equally cult kiss kiss bang bang and that didnt do too well at the box office either but if youre in the mood for something different but still entertaining then this could be exactly what youre looking for give it a go but leave your expectations at the door then book a flight to belguim,black_comedy
we visited bruge once its memorable and exhausting spiral staircase medieval bell tower is featured in this comic tragedy there is even a glimpse of the rope that substitutes for a banister some of the action also takes place on its canalsin brugehas something of a filmnoir feel but with humor added the 2008 films story about irish hit men brendan gleeson and colin farrel brought to mind vincent vega john travolta and jules winnfield samuel l jackson in 1994s pulp fiction but i thought bruge a darker movie it seems more tragic and the humor more subtle than pulp fiction still the more i think of it the more i can see similarities for example in both films lesser criminals make the mistake of crossing paths with them in bruge has encounters with incidental color characters who show up again later in ways more significant to the plotfrom other reviews i now guess the hit men are supposed to be part of a criminal gang however my initial impression from their skill discipline and ethics accidentally killing innocents is a violation of their code was that they were an ira celli thought the movie dragged a bit in the beginning but then picked up steam,black_comedy
i decided to buy me a copy of not rent it buy it mainly because it got high ratings and quite a bit of praise and it deserves it its a very very very good film no doubtfrom what i understand this is martin mcdonaghs first fulllength film all i have to say is this congratulations man it is truly a great film very nice direction and the characters of ray and ken are excellently portrayed and acted by colin farrell and brendan gleeson and every other characters on the sidelines are quite good as well they make their appearance their meaning and their resolution quite nicely hmmm this is a sign of a good directorwriter who knows how to tell a story i hope to see more films by this guy i really do im a wannabe filmmaker myself and it makes me happy to see a new director come along and make a good movie oh yeah you won an oscar for best short film back in 04 didnt you i havent seen your short but thats an awesome achievement maybe you can win another oscar someday although maybe winning an oscar isnt the greatest achievement for some people but i think its a nice honor after all your film made it on imdbs top 250 now that is something to really be proud of and i certainly will keep the film in my dvd collection for a long timebravothe movie is suspenseful its emotional its intriguing its a little funny its memorable and its watchable not only all that but its nicely welltold and it has some depth though not perfect well done martin mcdonagh i hope that you will have a successful career just dont lose your touch by all means810,black_comedy
this film is certainly worth it just to see how beautiful bruges really is its one city i have never seen yet in europe but im sure i will in the future along with other very beautiful cities in the low countries ie amsterdam antwerp brussels add to that a great balance of thriller and dark comedy and this could be the snatch of 2008 negatives i guess not seeing ralph fiennes till midway through the movie  yes he was on the telephone with brendan gleesons character earlier in the film but fiennes acting at his best has to be seen and he was definitely pretty good when he was on the screen but all in all a superb film definitely worth watching and definitely worth getting out on dvd eventually,black_comedy
bruges is a city in belgium that has most of its medieval architecture intact and it serves as a character in this film much as new york city london of los angeles often serve as characters in many films is a dark and very bloody comedy in which the city of bruges adds its own somewhat bizarre background bruges is not of our everyday world just as the events in the film are surely not daily experiencesray is a novice hit man who on his very first job accidentally kills a young boy ray is sent to bruges with an older hit man ken by their boss harry the reason given to ray by harry is so he can basically get his head together after his horrifying mistake the real reason is that ray has been sent to bruges to be murdered by ken at the beginning ken only suspects this assignment until he is contacted by harrythe older wiser more sophisticated ken is overwhelmed by the history art and beauty of bruges whereas the young and crude ray hates being stuck in this little city so far removed from modern times as their visit continues ken endeavors to interest ray in the sights and knowledge available but ray who is wracked with guild over murdering a young boy only wants to drown his remorse with drink drugs and the companionship of a newfound local girleventually ken receives the phone call he has been dreading in the back of his mind harry orders that ray be murdered because you cant kill a kid and live all of this leads to an extremely bloody ending but along the way the audience is treated to a string of bizarre characters and even more bizarre events that are filled with delightful dark dark element of comedyalong with the tight darkly humorous script the superior acting  especially the acting of the three male leads  is what gives its eight starsbrendan gleeson plays ken and his beautifully understated depiction of a man worn down by his own sins who just wants to survive is a sight to see it would seem impossible to feel any sympathy for a man who murders for his profession but gleeson gives us such a mancolin farrell at thirtytwo is ten years too young for the part of ray but his considerable acting talent enables you to forgive those extra years he makes you believe he is ray a young man from the wrong side of the tracks who has accidentally committed an unpardonable sin and is suffering in his soulralph fiennes may be a little over the top as harry the boss but he certainly pulls it off keep in mind that these are unreal people in an unreal environment so a little overacting can certainly be forgiventhese three stars of the film are supported by a group of premier actors in series of extremely unusual rolesas for the dvd the extra features are a real treat not only is there a very good making of video there is a beautiful tour of bruges the delight of the extras however is a short video based upon the considerable foul language in the film which would make a sailor blush this fking little video is fun funyes is dark and bloody if you shy away from such fare avoid this film but if you can plant your tongue firmly in your cheek and sit back to enjoy a flight of sinister fancy give this film a viewing,black_comedy
its extremely difficult to combine comedy and drama with any degree of success and this would be ibs main drawback even though the balance isnt bad as far as comedydramas go were supposed to get emotionally involved in various deaths here and yet there are overly goofy scenes too the silliest being the one with the brave and stubborn pregnant hotel owner forcing fiennes and farrell to arrange how theyll organize the shootout the resulting dialogue between the two belongs in an eddie murphy spoof not thisanother problem is the directors somewhat unrealistic depiction of gangsters  and not just any ordinary criminals but coldblooded killers in an allout comedy this would be forgiven but when gleeson shows genuine and deep interest in belgian history art and architecture i have to wonder if mcdonagh ever met any criminals let alone spent some time with them at least farrell is portrayed as a typical gangster moron ive also had trouble believing all these high morals and principles which apparently guide the lives of hardened gangsters gleeson as far as we can tell doesnt even know farrell that well and yet this hired hitman risks life and limb to protect a suicidal farrell there is absolutely no realism in this at all apparently it isnt just hollywood films that glorify sociopaths gleeson even becomes a martyr of sorts which is simply daft entertaining but daft fiennes even commits suicide as if he were some fanatical ultradisciplined 15thcentury japanese warrior again this is not a fullfledged comedy so i cant really buy into much of thisib has many surprise twists its strongest point apart from the acting of the lead male trio is the unpredictability admittedly plenty of the plot is guided by guyritchieesquire coincidences such as the main characters constantly bumping into each other by accident but because this is a semicomedy this can be overlooked the big finale would have been impossible without these chance encountersa bit disturbing was mcdonaghs nonlatent antiamericanism are the british still peeved off about losing that war over 200 years ago are they using the current wave of antius sentiment to channel these ageold frustrations mcdonagh might be able to answer that the midget character says at one point that he foresees a war between the whites and the blacks as if he were listening to a carnivore album but i do have to wonder if we might not end up with a unites states vs europe  friends war at some point the way this pathetic hysterical and mostly envybased antiamerican propaganda is going at the moment  being very much pushed further and further into the extreme by the leftist european media and movies such as this  theres a chance we might actually have that conflict a couple of decades from now i guess we all know whod come out the winner in that onei had to vomit when farrell described clemense poesy as beautiful upon seeing her the first time are they trying to sell us yet another mediocrelooking nepotistic female offspring as a ravishing hottie i immediately thought i checked her background and yep sure enough her daddy was a theater director thats the sort of small thing that opens doors i reckon email me if you want to see my rather large hollywood nepotism file bruges offers some very nice scenery ib has a fairly interesting story and an effective soundtrack the continental cast wasnt that good,black_comedy
absolutely superb film and so multilayered on one level its a crime thriller  at another a morality play and yet another an awfully funny in parts black comedy and yet its even more than that sumptuously filmed nothing is wasted in this intricately crafted plot nothing that is introduced is irrelevant to the whole story  including the dwarf and the film set and for a while i was wondering the significance of this yet it all comes together at the end which in itself played like a dream sequence the fulcrum around which the whole movie revolves  the death of a young boy during a hit is introduced subtly and then the acting is equally superb everyone excels the only slightly false note is played at the end which is why i give it a 9 but that is a minor quibble in this thoughtprovoking masterpiece i can happily see again,black_comedy
great sad brutal funny pardon me i meant fn funny are the first things that i can think of just after seeing this quite simple but effective movie as the title says the story is set in a mediumsized belgium town with a very rich historical background an earthly paradise for tourists of a more cultural type just one of the last places on earth where you would put a story that involves professional hit menbruges dangerous doesnt seem to make any sense but there are enough elements thrown in that make this concept work so well you almost wish to go there someday for yourself but lets face it offscreen bruges itself must really be kind of boring if you are not a cultural fan thats why it is apt to throw in american dwarfs movie scenes prostitutes drug dealers some of the crudest humor you can think of etc all that to go with those gothic churches and make the story more exciting to followbut what also makes it appealing is that our two protagonists especially farrel with his bleak feelings almost couldnt blend better with the cold dark and depressive atmosphere of the town but like most good comedies this film also builds its story on certain contrasts and the main contrasts that seems to exists is this notion of hit men that have a sort of a conscience which is what its all about and i have to say that at times this idea does seem a little unbelievable but without it the bleakness and guilt would disappear the atmosphere wouldnt have its effect and the story would have to be mostly rewrittenyet this is clearly not a motion picture for everyone since the r rating is very much in place it isnt always a plus because there seems to be just a scene or two that is almost ridiculously violent and that mildly spoils the otherwise very very thoughtful story,black_comedy
after a job in london goes wrong two hitmen ray and ken hide out in picturesque bruges at their bosses request ken the older of the two immediately falls in love with the belgian medieval city ray falls for a belgian con artist but hates the city they spend their time discussing and sharing their opinions on lifes difficulties and how the badly the previous job had went all seems fine until their boss makes a call to tell ken that ray has to pay for his mistake on the face of it has classic noir overtones but this is played for laughs although some questionable racial undertones and some extreme violence often break the comedic tone giving the film an overall quirky feeling the film never fails to surprise or entertain though it has a freshness which makes it quite appealing with so many loose ends to this film its a surprise that it all ends up so neat and tidy the final dream sequence with midgets and masked partygoers wouldnt look out of place in a herzog film,black_comedy
for viewers who dont mind pervasive use of the fword and occasionally the cword and also dont mind gory violence here and there this is a very wellcrafted and entertaining dark comedyas we learn in the extras on the dvd bruges belgium is an attractive medieval city that hasnt been featured in a movie so this story was sort of lets figure out how to get bruges in the story and it workscolin farrell is ray and brendan gleeson is ken two professional hit men who are sent to bruges for a while to see how things cool down in london after a hit ken is the veteran ray is the new guy things didnt exactly go right in his first hitralph fiennes is harry waters their boss he plays this role as a ruthless business man who has very strict rules about their professionfrench actress clmence posy is chlo  a local bruges actress that ray meets while a movie shoot was going on at night one of the actors is an american dwarf and while his appearance seems cosmetic at first becomes a key element in the overall resolution of the storyspoilers ray messed up his first job a hit on a priest when he accidentally shot and killed an innocent young boy harrys motive for sending them to bruges was to order ken to execute ray because harry a family man with sons and daughters has a strict rule against killing children meanwhile ray is despondent over all this and is about to take his own life in a bruges park when ken comes upon him ready to shoot him instead of simply observing he stopped ray from suicide then put him on a train out of the country but ray was brought back to bruges to face assault charges from a few days earlierwhile harry is traveling to bruges to deal with ken for not snuffing ray the whole thing comes to a climax in a town square at night when harry chases down ray and shoots him he also accidentally kills the dwarf and thinking he killed a child put his gun in his own mouth and killed himself as the movie ends ray is being transported to a hospital with grave wounds and we hear his thoughts hoping that he survives but we dont find out if he does,black_comedy
the tittle appealed to me being a great fan of french singer jaques brel as he mentions this city in one of his songs yes far fetch but true and completely useless as far as this movie is concerned another reason i have seen this movie is because it was run in an independent theater where i often go and see non english movies and i do so partly because my origins are in europe but also because i have great difficulty to hear and foreign movies are usually subtitled now were getting there this movie is entirely in english but what english irish sputtered a the speed of a machine gun so i really missed many gems from a clever dialog that got much response from the audience the language was very strong and this certainly did not impressed my wife of course the language im referring too is the one that even deaf people will hear i know this language is a real part of a certain world so if you dont approve or belong to this world you may have some difficulty in enjoying this movie despite these difficulties i have thoroughly enjoyed the beginning i imagine intended slowness creates a contrast for fast actionfollowing the comic events are just delightful but behind all this there is a strong display of contrasting characters if i was to complain about hearing difficulties  i probably would feel like a blind person complaining about image quality however i hope in the future those with such impairment will have text facility to enjoy full dialog with such big screens one would think there would be enough room below for a black strip to include white text i know im driving a hard bargain knowing that screen area is a little like prime real estate just the same sometimes it would be good if movie makers would have some thought for those infortunates yes a hard bargain next will have special request to create operas for half deaf people,black_comedy

this was an enjoyable film funny well acted and entertaining i thought colin farrel delivered his best performance in a long time but perhaps this is because he was playing himself in real life fiennes was solid but not spectacular though the cold menacing look from his eyes is fantastically creepy it is prob for this reason he makes such a great villain in the harry potter series for me though brendan gleeson stole the show  very convincing and believable performance as the gangster with a heart of gold great juxtaposition for a character and gleeson excellently pulls it offgreat writingfunny lines from writerdirector martin m i think there are many of us who could identify with the bored tourist in europe who is dragged kicking and screaming to yet another cultural exhibit i worried the film may have suffered somewhat of an identity crisis trying to be a comedy and drama at the same time i think the film ultimately succeeds but there were times where i felt the narrative and energy wanedthis was particularly the case with midgetdwarf scenes sure a few wise cracks about midgets done many times before and i must admit this falls into the category of bottom barrel comedy and the pace of the film would not have suffered what distracted me and i felt entirely irrelevant to the film was listening to the racist drunken banter spoken by the dwarf this scene was awkward and seemed thrown ini recognize one intent of the scene was to show how farrel tormented by past actions turns down what would typically be a great hedonistic evening for his character however i critique the dialog and creative choices made for the dwarf why attempt to be esoteric for the sake of being esoteric it failed this was a very weak point of the film it distracted the audience strange given that mm was formerly a playwrightnonetheless this film gets a 710 for me no doubt there could have been more thought in making the supporting characters dynamic and interesting,black_comedy
i am completely uncertain as to how to feel about its witty and funny but at the same time so terrible that i dont want to think about it i have never seen a movie like it and i can understand whymy only advice is be prepared to be shocked and trust me you will be as in parts it can become quite horrific but at the same time make you laugh at the black humour throughout not for the squeamish as theres a lot of quite disgusting violence dont let anyone young see it as its a bit too heavy for most people under 16 to handle this also happens to be the first time i have never felt compassion towards the characters in the story,black_comedy
set in a foreign idyliic medieval town sees two irish hit men endure time together with brendan gleeson portraying ken and colin farrell as ray these sort of films live or die based on the quality of acting this film certainly lives the film initially takes on characteristics of a classic foreign film simple camera techniques and frequent pans of the setting and scenery its the acting which sets this film apart emotionally high scenes are performed beautifully and subtle conversations executed perfectly farrell certainly deserves credit for his cynical teen like attitude during sight seeing whilst gleeson takes on a fatherly figurethe writing and dialogue is rich with frequent use of swearing and clever dark comedy has a vast variety of scenes such as shootouts drug use and conversations of the afterlife my favorite three scenes or actions are as followed farrell punching a woman after being threatened with a bottle farrell karate chopping a cocaine abusing midget farrell firing blanks into the face of a skin headed puffhas many elements romance violence comedy and actionit is a great film due mainly to the writing and of course the acting from laughs and jokes in a pub to suicide and gun fights the film keeps your attention right till the cliff hanger ending and despite farrell killing a young boy you find yourself hoping he doesnt die even if it means having to stay in fucking bruge,black_comedy
i went to see this film with my girlfriend who hated it she was not best pleased that i choose this film however i thought it was pretty good and it has been a while since i have heard so many people in the cinema laugh all togetherthis film has a lot of mixed reviews when i bring it up in conversation and i can see why it is dark and does have jokes some people just may not likeit is very well put together and thought about which is one of the reasons i like it colin did a great job and was funny as hellif you are thinking about whether you should watch this or not i would read some reviews and ask some friends who have seen it it is definitely a marmite film you either love it or hate it,black_comedy
i enjoy movies that make a location one of the main themes in this case stands apart because of bruges which is in belgiumthis is a story of two hit men with very different personalities who are sent away to bruges after a botched job bruges a historically and architecturally interesting city but which is also rather boringthe writing was good could have been much better with a few minor adjustments and the acting of ferrell gleeson and fienes was enjoyable the cinematography of bruges was top notch this film was a dark comedy and was funny but not that funny the ideology that drove the plotnamely hit men shouldnt kill children was to me not that intense of motive for people who chose to be assassins you would think that at least one of the 3 assassins in the film would not subscribe to that ideologyi was a little put off by the antiamerican theme that reared its ugly head throughout the film and by the racist comments by the druginduced midget the little persons wild commentary could have focused on something else besides a war between white and black people besides it didnt seem to fit this characters personality at all either regardless of whether he was on drugs or not i also found it odd that the only americans in the film were either overweight or a midget hence of strange physical proportions this unfortunate antiamerican current made me enjoy the film slightly less than i would have and brought down my rating a tad a film that at best could achieve an 8 of 10 stars i give it 7 of 10 stars due to the antiamerican themes plus the story line is simply not believable enough to warrant any higher of a score with that said i recommend the film ferrell and gleeson at their best and great cinematography make this film worthwhile,black_comedy
this is a favourite film of mine not one of my top top favs but its definitely up there and this movie gives you a heck of a lot to make it your favouritemartin mcdonagh is a man who carved out a successful career for himself in theatre about a decade ago i think and by the end of the movie its pretty clear that its written by a playwright every scene had fantastic dialogue within this dialogue the characters are built up for funny characters to real people in a real situation and every scene has a purpose in the film as a whole each scene contributing to the ending overall plot line character and overall tone simultaneouslythis is why this film is fantastic it seems to do everything at the same time and not a single line is wasted it all leads up to this perfect ending to this brilliant climax that leaves you deliciously satisfied even the score and backdrop photography were fantastic the score giving this slightly haunting and disenchanted feel and the photography complementing it perfectlyall in all theres a reason why its got 81 although it perhaps deserves a rating just a little higher,black_comedy
a brilliantly written black comedy with some great underlying implications the whole movie feels like a dream the dialogue is outstanding and the acting performances are fairly good as well one of the best littleknown movies ive seen so farthe movie starts slowly and quite uneventful while the characters develop but becomes faster with some memorable moments as the movie progresses the characters are interesting and intelligently written and the performances by farrel fiennes and gleeson manage to do them justicethe symbolism you can discern if you pay close attention adds an extra layer to this movie that gives it an edge over other black comedies you should not however expect to see a lot of action scenes,black_comedy
a popcorndrama is what comes to mind this comedicdrama exhibits all the essential theatricalelements to create a good story that being said it seemed much of the storyline was forced meaning several scenes seemed to happen forthesake of exploring that particular literary element the result of this is an exhaustive view of each character making them seem rather onesided which isnt necessarily bad but i prefer deeper more dynamic charactersthe story itself was welltold dialogue was entertaining acting was decent but i had higher expectations for this one to sum it up this movie was simply simple,black_comedy
has flaws in abundance particularly through the first 30 minutes where you are served a couple unlikeable characters a very slow plot build and bad dialogue with an extremely distracting overuse of the f word for a while you might be forgiven for wondering if you are watching something written by a fourteen year old boy trying unsuccessfully to emulate tarantino or guy richie i caught myself wondering if i should turn it off and do something better with my time instead my wife commented on how bored she wasfortunately for us we bore through that terrible first halfhour and were subsequently rewarded with a movie that became increasingly enjoyable fresh and dare i say it poignant as it moved along this is for the most part down to an amazing performance by brendan gleeson collin farrel is good here and ralph fiennes is great as usual but its gleeson who steals every scene and its the honour and integrity of his character ken that will linger in your mind long after the credits have rolled,black_comedy
wonderful first feature work by mcdonagh thought all 3 main actors were superbsurprised nobody mentioned the football quote  purgatory is not really bad and not really great a bit like tottenham hotspur as a spurs fan i knew exactly what he meantthanks guys great movie  somebody mentioned earlier a far better film than no country for old men i certainly preferred gleeson to lewis but then again viewers differ personally well worth a look without the need for major soul searching might be a problem of translation for us audiences  laughed at the person who mentioned sex scenes  dont even recall that,black_comedy
contains spoilers ray dont know any belgium jokes and if i did i think id have the good sense not tohang on is belgium with all those child abuse murders lately i do know a belgium joke whats belgium famous for chocolates and child abuse and they only invented the chocolates to get to the kidsthe line above is only one of the several hilarious yet sometimes offensive to some one liners in the film theres this other very offensive joke about a seesaw and a big fat fing retarded black woman but i wouldnt dare tread on thatis funny violent sarcastic witty smart rude offensive boisterous but all in all  laugh out loud fun colin farrells performance as ray the disgruntled hitman is so wickedly hilarious you couldnt stop laughing at his witty one liners and all that crass rude jokes his buddy is coassassin ken excellently portrayed by brendan gleeson whose deep reserve for colins ray takes on a whole new level when he jumps out of a bell tower to save his best mates life thats what i call brothersfolife on the other hand theres the villain boss harry whose demeaning stature and ruthless persona perfectly fits the actor who plays him the demeaning and ruthless ralph fiennesis one of those films thats so good you probably havent even seen it yet,black_comedy
this is such a fine piece of work it is a laughoutloud movie with many surprising moments and so much wit the blend of the dark side of things with comedy is superb i think the genre is clear its black comedy there are so many scenes when you actually expect the dialogue to develop differently or actually the plot itself and its just so naturally funny this is a movie that has to be watched in the original language because the irish comments and sense of humour is in itself hilarious i would say except for the last 15 minutes when i thought it was all going a bit over the top which is why i give 9 out of 10 this is a very inventive original way of storytelling an intriguing plot with character development beautiful shots of bruges and the sense of humour is just very deep very fine superb,black_comedy
this was a really good dark comedy the story is unique and takes place in a beautiful setting a nice contrast considering the ensuing bloodshed the acting is good from everyone and both gleeson and farrell make a great pair of hit men it was also very nice to see fiennes posing as a highly charged and funny crimeboss despite his rather brief appearancethe humor though subtle is also good and consistent throughout the movie clearly taking aim at americaamericans in a few instances the director mixes all these elements well delivering a beautiful kudos to the cinematographer engaging  entertaining dark crime comedyoverall i rate this as the best colin farrell movie and my favorite movie of 2008 so far,black_comedy
crikey theres a lot of swearing this movie not that its a bad thing but you do wonder how itll go down in the states where people are a little less familiar with the word ct being used like punctuationif youre not a sensitive soul who abhors such sweary behavior youll love this though because its fantastic the trailers would have you believe its a madcap jape when in reality its dark as hell but shot through with a brilliantly judged jetblack humor that makes it a pretty unique watch its not often a film this sombre will have you rolling in the aisles and its a tricky thing to do right but nails it seemingly effortlesslyit also looks beautiful what with the location being pretty damn gorgeous and colin farrell despite popular opinion is a great actor when hes given a decent script to flex his muscles with if theres any justice people will cotton on to this and forget swat ever existedit only starts to dip ever so slightly with the appearance of ralph fiennes but thats just because youre having such a good time watching colin farrell drink snort and insult his way around bruges that you almost forget theres a plot so when it appears it feels almost intrusivethat feeling doesnt last long though such is the films deft balancing of tone meaning that even once the laughs give way to the more serious stuff youre invested sufficiently in the characters that the finale packs a hell of a punch rounding off a brilliant experience and one of the best films youre likely to see this year,black_comedy
not a taut thriller yet not a frantically paced dark comedy in the vein of guy richies snatch or lock stock and two smoking barrels this is an even paced dark comedy that keeps its humor morbid and flowing but maintains a semblance of character to keep viewers invested in the main leads some rather graphic bloody scenes which wont appeal to everybody but all in all another enjoyable film from overseas although i dont usually enjoy the film work of colin in this film his smarminess works hes a man using smart alecky attitude to cover the emotional strain of what hes done but the film makers wisely dont stuff this down our throat to excess just the right amount to drive the point home,black_comedy
2008 written and directed by martin mcdonagh stars colin farrell as ray and brendan gleeson as ken these two professional killers have been sent to bruges to lie low after a killinggonewrong their boss is harry played by ralph fiennes who follows their progress by phone from englandray is hyperactive depressed and hates bruges ken can actually enjoy the wonders of bruges even though its just a stop on the road to the next killing clmence posy is chlo a woman who hangs around movie sets to deal drugs and offer her body as enticement to the unwary ive been to bruges twice and its probably the most enchanting city ive ever seen its called the sleeping beauty city because progress passed it by and there was no incentive to tear down the old and build the new by the time people got around to modernizing bruges they understood the value of a city preserved as if in amber and they left it the way it was you actually get a pretty good tour of bruges in the movie and it looks beautiful thats the pointits a beautiful city in which terrible things are happeningthe terrible things naturally involve ray ken harry chlo and other lowlife types as well what makes the story a fairy tale is that all kinds of mayhem take place on the streets and in the houses of bruges and no one except the main characters appears to notice people shoot at each other coins rain down from a tower and a police officer never appears bruges has police and they intervene there as they would intervene anywhere else you have to suspend disbelief to accept their absence in the filmdespite this lack of realism the movie is both a powerful psychological study and a real thriller its definitely worth seeking out in a theater and will work fairly well on the small screen as well see it,black_comedy
i wasnt entirely sure what to expect but every expectation i had was exceeded it worked on so many levels there were times when i was still laughing about a scene when something more serious or moving happened to stop me dead in my tracks and vice versa but this didnt make it feel bitty as with poor editing but quite a rollercoaster due to a sublime knack for timing the dialogue was sharp witty and at times poignant some of the conversations were just downright hilarious others so real you knew you were listening to the work of a talented perceptive writer the acting was first rate throughout brendan gleeson and colin farrell were outstanding cfs performance should have his critics eating their words yet i think the standard of the smaller roles really helped to take this film beyond a vehicle for the leads special mention to the hotel owner natalie elizabeth berringtonthe characterisation was spellbinding too just watch and see how subtly youre made to empathise with quite unsavoury characters ie the skinhead puff mugger and how the leads although so intellectually opposite compliment each other and draw you in with their honesty and even their moralityeven beautiful dull bruges as a setting is perfectfor me its one of those films that doesnt simply wash over you and rinse off you absorb it and are therefore touched by it brilliant,black_comedy
the three main characters in this film speak in torrents of obscenities well known words for sexual intercourse and contempt and female genitalia and contempt in real life i think badly of people who talk this way and try to stay away from them in the movie that martin mcdonagh wrote and directed however the repetitious obscenities take on an almost magical quality as they reveal layers within the characters who speak them the effect is like that in some of michael mcclures poems in which common words are continually repeated the result is not to build metaphors or similes but to develop weight by simple presenceat first the beautiful old belgian city of bruges seems an entirely wrong place for the two irish gangsters who are sent to it after one of them botches the killing of a priest by shooting and killing a child as well ken and ray both hired killers are sent by harry their gangster boss harry has pleasant childhood memories of burges and his subordinates speculate that he thinks its a good place for them to cool out ken an experienced assassin likes bruges and is ready to be a serious european tourist ray young and petulant cant say bruges without a preliminary obscenity and says he hates being thereas the men tour the citys wellpreserved medieval structures they visit the groeninge museum and view two paintings that capture even rays attention one is hieronymus boschs last judgment with its many images of torment the lower portion of the middle panel of the triptych is what is shown in the film representing judgment day it is full of nude human figures many of them pierced by swords and arrows a large knife emerges from a plant held by an ape in the panels lower righthand corner the other more realistic painting is of the judgment of cambyses by gerard david it is a portion of an 15th century netherlandish diptych that depicts sisammes an ancient greek judge mentioned by herodotus being flayed alive as punishment for allowing money to influence his judgments several men are cutting sisammess skin from his body his teeth are clenched but he is not screaming his torturers calmly go about their business and are viewed indifferently by a group of welloutfitted aristocratsthe paintings are more than background to the films action they are physical representations of the turmoil within kens and rays souls similar to the torments in dantes inferno ultimately mcdonagh is a catholic moralist though it is easy to miss this aspect of his work as it is so often overshadowed by his eccentric mixture of cleverness and repulsive violenceken continues to visit old buildings and museums and ray has adventures appropriate to his station in criminal life he exchanges insults with a dwarf arranges a liaison with a beautiful local woman drug dealer and blinds a russian in one eye with a blank bullet then ken gets a call from harry ordering him to kill ray it seems that harry doesnt approve of rays having murdered a kid ken doesnt like it but hes a company man who follows his bosss orders when he approaches ray from the back with a drawn gun he sees that rays about to shoot himself ken cant help himself from stopping ray he calls harry harry cusses him out and takes a train to burges thus begins a bloodbath thats probably the least interesting part of the film except for ray all of the major characters and some secondary ones end up dead as in hamlet on steroidsthe extreme violence of mcdonaghs film has consequences like the violence in before the devil knows youre dead and unlike the violence in the departed still the unreality of much of it and the total absence of any law enforcement response take suspension of disbelief further than many viewers may be willing to go and the film has a stagy quality both in the way in which characters appear at just the right moment for a bloody denouement and in mcdonaghs inability to abandon the proscenium arch fundamentally though i dont always like mcdonaghs work but i cant deny its power,black_comedy

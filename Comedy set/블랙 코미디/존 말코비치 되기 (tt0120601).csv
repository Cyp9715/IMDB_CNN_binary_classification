charlie kaufman script and spike jonze director burst on the scene together with their collaboration on this crazy masterpiece pushes the limits of storytelling this wildly imaginative film shows that even the most surreal storyline can still be made entertaining if a filmmaker doesnt care about conventions and knows just what the medium is capable of perhaps the most original release in a year that had several very original releases fight club and the matrix were both also released in 99 the films playful creative energy had an effect on screenwriters directors actors and producers that can hardly be overstated there had simply never been anything like it  and one only has to look at a contemporary tv show like legion to see what a mark this film left groundbreaking and simply inspired 9 stars out of 10favorite films imdbcomlistmkjokvqlsbslesserknown masterpieces imdbcomlistls070242495,black_comedy
this film was absolutely incredible attempting to explain the plot in any way that would do it justice would be an excercise in futility but let it be said that i see many many movies and in my lifetime i have never seen a movie such as being john malkovitchthe acting is completely brilliant  cameron diaz is nearly unrecognizable both in behavior and appearance as is john cusack john malkovich was presented with an interesting opportunity in playing himself and he seems to have seized the opportunity with relish  he is most definitely not being himself in front of the camera but instead creates this wonderful character of john malkovich the vesselive admired spike jonezs work for a good long time and im pleased to say that in his first full length feature as a director he succeeds with flying colors in creating an original beautiful humorous and good natured picturesee because come oscar time youre going to want to know why its winning,black_comedy

1999 starring john cusack cameron diaz orson bean catherine keener john malkovich and charlie sheen director spike jonze   running time 113 minutes   rated r for sexuality and languageby blake frenchit is not every day that i use words in my movie reviews such as unique creative inventive imaginative original fresh mesmerizing and unmatched under the circumstances of a wonderfully hilarious presentation of an incomprehensible idea i find myself using every one of those phrases and then some more being deserved everything about it is labyrinthine intriguing and very funny it is one of the years best films and should be well presented come academy award timedetails the relationship between craig and lotte schwartz they basically live an old fashioned life in a small apartment with a miniature zoo of pets and a puppet factory inside lotte is a typical unattractive homemaker while craig holds that unusual occupation of being a professional puppeteer desperately searching for employment craig soon visits a business for an interview as a filer when he discovers for some odd reason the construction of the office floor is all but several feet tall forcing all employees to bend over backwards just to walk aroundone of those employees is named maxine a highly seductive coworker of craigs when he asks her out for a beer one night craig experiences lustful thoughts about her and nearly begins an affair as his seemingly loving wife wonders around her happy little apartment all by herselfas you can see the household isnt exactly a joyful situation all things change from blossoming sexual confusion to inner selfesteem when craig uncovers a small door behind a filing cabinet in his office it is tucked away hidden acutely well in a dark corner which is found mysteriously by accident when craig droops a paper behind the cabinet after craig explores this deep miniature seemingly endless hallway he discovers this secret door leads to the brain of actor john malkovich for fifteen minutes then spits you out along the roadside afterwardswow sounds like alice in wonderland doesnt itwell sort of  craig first tells his coworker about his discovery who continues to think hes nuts then after explaining and showing this portal to his wife who is hysterical maxine begins to believe craig and concoct a devilish idea to sell tickets allowing a pedestrian to enter the mind of a famous celebrity the tagline ever wanted to be someone else now you canit is very intriguing how the narrative point of view is juggled between craig and then lotte after the problem is introduced and then solved the couples deadend lives are lifted in glory this creates a second conflict moving us smoothly into the second act perfect internal problems are created with the two female leads lotte and maxine find themselves physically attracted to each other in unbelievable character twists the two end up having a femininity sexual relationship while one is entrapped in the mind of malkovich and the other experiences the actual malkovich it is a beautifully crafted structure with act breaks so clear and complications so faultless it is no wonder while this is such an effective picturealso first rate here are the performances although the film offers strange types of roles for these actors to indulge themselves in they do a wonderfully energetic job cameron diaz is flawlessly cast as craigs sexually and mentally uncoordinated wife and delivers us a comically riotous character john cusack as craig himself is superior and believable as a down on his luck puppeteer and possesses a perfect blend of humor and unpredictable qualities with his character also quite good here john malkovich who has much more of a difficult role than one would think he has some hard scenes where craig controls him while inside his mind which requires great skill to performhowever better than any performance and more amazing then any flawless characters or plot is the concept of a human being thinking up such an absurd idea as the imagination behind the beauty of with such a penetrating magical atmosphere to it it is kind of a shame that the filmmakers created this film in the form of a black comedy instead of something more harrowing although comedy is simply the most logical choice to categorize this type of film wouldnt it have been interesting to see this movie as a drama or perhaps as a spiritual awakening pictureregardless the film still has an oddly powerful message to it which i will not nor do i ever directly reveal in any of my reviews you see since different individuals come from different backgrounds and thus see things differently it is because of this that i do not allow my personal take on a message persuade another filmgoer whose idea of a moral may be much different than my own but i will say that might not overtake the box office but for appreciative movie patrons this one is sure to be treasured for a long time to comebrought to you by gramercy pictures,black_comedy
1999 the spike jonzes directorial debut is an amazing film  hip inventive delightfully weird incredibly funny and disturbingly serious with the gleefully absurd plot twists lets face it that was a stroke of genius  to throw together the tragic medieval lovers abelard and heloise in the street show created by a talented puppeteer craig scwartzh john cusack with the nimble fingers but out of work in todays wintry economic climate elijah the chimp with the mental problems that go back to his childhood the surreal office that is located on the 7 12 store of a new york city office building and a floor is four feet high add cameron diaz craigs animals loving wife lotte completely unrecognizable aging and balding charlie sheen cynical and practical maxine catherine keener who had an unique experience of having two people looked at her with complete lust and devotion through the same pair of eyes and send them all to the wild ride inside the famous and respectable actor john malkovichs brain to see what he sees and to feel what he feels to the trip that would last 15 minutes and end up in a ditch on the side of new jersey turnpike this is just the beginningoh and what john horatio malkovich feels with all the travelers in his head and what he sees when he enters the portal to his own brain you have to find out for yourself what drug were charlie kaufman and spike jonze on not even two hours long the movie never ceases to surprise and entertain is a fascinating and truly original film which i love and always enjoy watching even if there were never a connection with any of its characters with the exception of abelard and heloise and elijah the chimp,black_comedy
all hail spike jonze for he is a genius not content with being the undisputed king of music videos hes set his sights on fulllengthfeaturefilms one might imagine that the often surreal always innovative humour of his short music promos might not transfer across to a much longer production  like hell is a fresh exciting stroke of geniusjohn cusack is craig schwartz an unemployed puppeteer looser guy in order to earn a living he is forced to find himself a regular job only it soon becomes apparent that regular it is not working as a filing clerk on floor seven and a half craig stumbles across a portal into john malkovichs head no really thats what happens anyway he turns this into a business venture with help from the beautiful maxine catherine keener whom he lusts after maxine is more interested however in his wife lotte diaz like youve never seen her before but only when shesdont worry if this all sounds a little strange to you it should do its probably the most surreal film ever made i obviously cant give all the credit for this to director spike jonze charlie kaufman is the genius that wrote this insanity hes the most acutely imaginative and ingenious man of our timewith such a fantastic cast the acting is of course superb everyones brilliant especially malkovich himself well obviously you say hes playing himself  yes but hes also playing himself being played by an increasingly psychotic puppeteermonkey flash backs and a restaurant full of malkoviches are highlights of the insanely brilliant and brilliantly insane movie if you thought that spike jonez could never top the daft punk talking dog video you have never been so wrong in your life1010,black_comedy
what does it feel like to be inside someone elses skin  some people find out in the highly imaginative directed with style by spike jonze and starring john cusack cameron diaz catherine keener and john malkovich  when out of work puppeteer craig schwartz cusack gets a job as a file clerk on the 7 12 floor of an office building its the beginning of a bizarre interlude that will ultimately take him and a few others as well into a realm beyond the known  one day he discovers a small doorway hidden behind a filing cabinet curious he ventures into the dark beyond and is suddenly sucked into the mind of actor john malkovich  after fifteen minutes of seeing through malkovichs eyes and experiencing what the actor is experiencing craig is just as suddenly and inexplicably dropped into a ditch beside the new jersey turnpike  unable to contain himself he confides what has happened to him to maxine catherine keener a woman who also works on 7 12  immediately she sees money in the prospect of having a portal into the mind of john malkovich and she convinces craig that they should start a business  jm inc  for two hundred dollars a pop people can have the experience of a lifetimejonze has taken a unique screenplay that is clever witty humorous and totally engrossing and turned it into one of the most ingenious films to come our way in a long long time  in fact theres never been anything quite like it  it is distinct and filled with nuance and subtle shades of humor sometimes dark sometimes hilarious but riveting throughout  and the performances are absolutely first rate all around  keener deservedly got the oscar nod for best supporting actress but cusack diaz and bean are also exemplary here  cusack comes through with one of the best characters hes ever done theres an edgy quiet intelligence to craig a bohemian at heart with a wife lotte diaz and an apartment full of pets snakes birds and a chimp  hes reserved generally takes things as they come and exudes a certain boyish charm when he becomes smitten with maxine  diaz taking on a decidedly unglamorous role is terrific as lotte the somewhat unremarkable pet shop clerk who comes alive after experiencing the portal its a great character part and diaz plays it for all its worth connecting with the audience while ably conveying lottes sense of confusion and repressed yearnings  and orson bean nearly steals the show as dr lester craigs boss the hundredandfive year old man with a secret that holds the key to the portal  its a memorable performance filled with nuance and subtle humor the scene in which he interviews jobapplicant craig is classic  malkovich as himself is the icing on the cake he plays it straight with a finesse and distinction that makes the unbelievable somehow credible while lending an easy natural flow to the innate humor of the story  the malkovich malkovich sequence and his rendition of the puppets dance are unforgettable scenesthe supporting cast includes mary kay place floris charlie sheen charlie carlos jacott larry willie garson guy in restaurant and byrne piven captain mertin  written by charlie kaufman is a movie that is an experience in itself  and jonze and his entire cast should be given a standing ovation for bringing this one to life for making it breathe  its the kind of film you wait for to come along but rarely does and it demands to be seen more than once  like lotte once youve been through the portal you have to do it again once youve tasted the nectar theres no turning back   1010,black_comedy
originality is one thing that i very much admire in cinema and its also the reason i rate so highly charlie kaufman has taken an amazingly weird premise and twisted round a suitably offbeat story to create a movie that is as bizarre as it is as it is compelling and its definitely a major highlight of american cinema in the 1990s charlie kaufman may have scripted his most acclaimed film in 2004 with eternal sunshine of the spotless mind but if you want to see his best work  you need look no further than his first feature quite how anyone could have thought of this premise remains a mystery but im certainly glad that kaufman did the story revolves around a portal that leads directly into the head of the actor john malkovich after discovering this portal puppeteer craig schwartz shares it with his colleague and crush the beautiful maxine lund things start to get complicated when craigs wife lottie becomes involved and it turns out that craigs not the only one with a crush on maxinethe usually presentable john cusack and cameron diaz are completely unrecognisable as this films leading couple and both give career highlight performances catherine keener fleshes out a threesome of leads she is seductively sexy and delivers a performance that reflects the quality of this film on the whole and of course john malkovich stars also the fact that its john malkovich who is the title actor is what really makes this film had the film have been say being tom cruise it wouldnt have had nearly the same impact malkovich is a big actor but hes not that big and the fact that its him takes the film away from the mainstream and allows its offbeat indie roots to stay intact kaufman ensures that the story works by constantly adding new and weird events into the plot and this in turn ensures that we never know whats coming next of course this is exactly what you want from any film the elements of the story arent bound tightly enough to really make a lasting impression where substance is concerned but it hardly matters as theres enough offbeat invention in this film to more than adequately mask that fact its easy to call this movie pretentious or silly but its also pointless is a modern classic,black_comedy
though i had liked the few spike jonze music videos ive seenweezers buddy holly and the beastie boys one i was hesitant about whether he could make the jump to movies for as we know for every good mtv raised directordavid fincher there are several bad onesmichael bay  and this is truly a concept which could have gone either way  but this is one of the most original funny and enjoyable movie experiences ive had this year every idea pays off in ways you dont expect all four main actors do well cast against type and its awfully hard to pick whos the bestthough i suspect john malkovich will be remembered at oscar time the dialogue is greatdont stand in the way of my actualization as a man may be the best line of the year and i cant think of another way to describe this except go see it now,black_comedy
the most original film to come out in ages a film that has onejoke premise written all over it but this film has about four dozen good jokes each one brilliantly conceived and executed acted to perfection beautifully written directed by the insanely original and wild spike jonze this is a great great film,black_comedy
this is one film that has me completely torn  on the one hand there is so much to admire about  the film is rich with great performances it is directed very well by a new comer it is a wonderfully original idea and seeing john malcovich have the guts to portray himself or to parody himself is quite amazing  but on the other hand there is much to critisize about this movie  it is slow it doesnt really have a point and the only metaphors that i can get from the film are not clear or really that mind blowing and the last half an hour of the film is plain and simplybad  i really think that this is the type of film that cannot fail critically critics are too afraid to tell it like it is when it comes to an arty film like this one  it is safe and obvious to critisize a film like armageddon or bone collector but admitting that you didnt really enjoy a film such as this is tricky as a critic because you may look foolish to your cronies so naturally all of them come out and tell you how wonderful and amazing and great and ya da ya da ya da this film is  but the one thing that i noticed when i read all of the reviews before i saw the film is that not one review really told me why this film is all that they say it is and that is because it isnt  as i said there is much to admire about just not a lot to like  but i will tell you what is good before i tell you what isntthe performances are incredible  john cusack cameron diaz katherine keener and john malkovich turn in stellar portrayals of who they are cusack is the eccentric puppeteer that cant seem to get a break in life diaz is his repressed wife that perhaps only a few years ago would have been not just smart but down right gorgeous  now she doesnt care about herself only her animals that she cares for which includes a repressed monkey  she goes through one of the biggest awakenings  keener plays maxine a sexy bitch that cusack falls in lust for and then love  she is a bit of an enigma yet she is very self assured  and of course malkovich plays a version of himself perhaps a version that we the public think he is  all four of these performances are rich and deeply layered  the story is also good in the sense that it is different than anything i have seen  it is fresh and nice at times to see a movie that is different than anything you have seen before  this is one of those movies and i enjoyed it for that reason  but that is where my praise ends  that is all that i can really say is good about the film  while the film has its moments of comedy and of interesting observations about life  the big one being not to live vicariously through someone else or you may lose your identity  it just didnt keep me interested or entertained for the majority of the film and especially for the last half hour  and for me to really enjoy a film and to think it is worth recommending to others there has to be something to keep my interest  this film just moves along and seems to go nowhere  it doesnt have anything really great to say and it doesnt really take you anywhere  as i said sure it is different but that does not make it good i do have a feeling that this film is going to get a rediculous amount of mention at oscar time but that is not fair  there are at least five films that i think are worthy of oscar mention before this one and other bound to be great films havent even come out yet  the green mile just to name one i think perhaps this is a film that should be seen once because maybe what i get or didnt get out of it is completely different than what someone else will  after all there are many positive reviews in this very forum and perhaps that is saying something but i personally dont like the film all that much and i think there are many films at the theater that are worth your time more than this one is  if you see it dont say you havent been warned  this is one film that i think the general public is wrong about and the longer it stays out the more people will have a chance to see it and then people will realize that weird and original does make it great  it deserves kudos for being like that but not praise  there is a difference,black_comedy
this is an insanely great movie nothing has been attempted like this before and it keeps coming up with surprises and ingenuity until the very end i laughed with delight all the way through even though the movie is intentionally unrelentingly disorienting and creepyjohn malkovich is fabulous playing himself john cusack and cameron diaz deliver some of their best the directing is amazingespecially considering that its spike jonzes first big onewhen my friends and i left the theater we were stunned happy and exhilarated and everything seemed a little surreal,black_comedy
strong reviews a great cast and an interesting premise made me rent this movie an unfunny demented and just plain bad film made me wish i had never been born how this movie can be lauded as a classic is beyond me quite frankly the fact that it is such a cult classic makes me wonder if the end of western civilization is nearis it original yes is it creative yes but is it good a big no i must have looked at the clock every 2 minutes just waiting for thisthingin front of me to be over with just because a movie is new and original does not mean that it is good i hate to generalize but i certainly can see this garbage being a favorite of pseudointellectual java sipping art house gurus due to its bizarreness and originality for most normal people however this movie will be nothing but a miserable experience ive never seen a comedy that was less funny the plot went from mildly interesting to surreal the acting was stiff the characters werent compelling or endearing how can one like a movie if the characters arent likable or at the very least interesting and oh yeah it was not funny at all it will take a court order and 10 stout men to enforce it to ever get me to watch this horrid movie again in fact itll take something extraordinary for me to ever see a spike jonze movie again yup it was that badive probably seen worse movies but youd have to give me a day or two to think of oneavoid like it is the plague and thank me later if you are compelled to watch it well i warned you110,black_comedy
i cant think of a whole lot i can say about this movie other than the fact that it is humorless boring and in one word tripe i felt after watching this movie that there were few instances that one could waste their time as much as this movie wastes time the truly disturbing fact is that this movie was rated 50 on the top 250 of imdb this lessens my faith in mankind,black_comedy
this is the first film ive seen thats been so unbearable ive had to turn it off i bought the dvd after reading the gushing reviews here on imdb the concept was excellent and i love movies with an unusual story i watched it with several housemates most of which left the room before i stopped the moviei was appalled by the shallow characterisation the lack of any comedy in fact the lack of any endearing quality whatsoever some scenes were such a cacophony the chimps in particular that it suggested the film had been constructed from outtakesall in all is an incredible waste of a concept and talented actors  a film so unlikeable that its practically offensiveto all those reviewers that bigged up this dog of a movie  you wasted an hour of my life  you suck,black_comedy
a prime example of just because you have not seen anything like it before does not make it a cinematic masterpiece  scuzzy puppeteer john cusack and snide coworker catherine keener discover a portal into the mind of actor john malkovich playing himself in their bizarre office and decide to profit from it  marketed as a comedy the film is inventive most definitely original but the laughs virtually dry up after the first 40 minutes  the strange plot takes one bizarre turn after another incorporating lesbianism spousal abuse and cults into the mix  events become more and more sinister disturbing and serious during the running time  unfortunately the main characters including an unrecognizable cameron diaz as cusacks frumpy wife are so odious that it becomes impossible to identify with them and by the climax one really does not care what is done to whom  keener is initially terrific as the reprehensible profiteer but she is given limited notes to play  malkovich may be a good sport but he is a pretty dull character as envisioned here  it is hard to recall cusack ever being this unappealing  director spike jonze has definite potential but his ambition spins out of control far too quickly on this project  even the look of the film with everything in drab blues and greys is a downer  for all of the hype the film is an amazingly empty experience,black_comedy
well first of i want to make clear that i am a person who is not put off by out there concepts nor am i intellectually devoid i only point this out as many people seem to think they could be the only reasons why a person could not enjoy this masterpiece im not going to say this films awful but i will say its over rated all the cast put in a good performance and i particularly enjoyed john cusack as i usually do yet i felt cheated by this film firstly the concept of delving into someone elses mind in some kind of voyeuristic power trip is nothing new it has been explored in novels before today and even video games ie body rides by richard laymon and the game psychic detective i state this to show that the idea behind this film isnt so revolutionary as some may think in laymons body rides a bracelet is used to go in the mind of others and coincidentally the main character in the story ultimately uses the bracelet to jump into somebody elses mind to escape death and in psychic detective the main character can do the same merely by though im not saying the stories are identical but they do share common ideas secondly i just couldnt relate to the characters i know they were supposed to be obnoxious but i ended up almost not giving a damn about them as a result of this however at this point i must point out something that did touch me in this film it was cusacks character craig whos fate was somewhat undeserved and i felt sympathy for him his act showing that he did indeed love maxine and i also found the thought of malkovichs daughter becoming the next vessel disturbing as in essence lestermalkovichetc was stealing somebodys life to sum up as a whole the film did have points where i chuckled or felt something but i ultimately felt denied and i think people should allow other people to think that this film isnt as good as it has been made out to be in my opinion if a friend has it borrow it and see for yourself but dont waste your money on a rental or a dvd its just not worth it even if you enjoy fringe cinema as i do you will find no substance in this film to satisfy you only a huge hollow space around which there is a thinly woven plot,black_comedy
having read reviews and the basic idea of the movie i really was looking forward to seeing this film little did i know it would be the worst movie i ever had the misfortune of paying to see i guess what really made it awful was that it began with a great idea but went nowhere with it so many questions were leftmajor spoilers aheadwhy wasnt there a bigger fight from john malkovich when his head was being taken over who would pay to be in malkovichs head nothing happens why was orson beanes character the ruler of malkovich when all those people went with him why would they go for eternal life if they had no part in it and why use a lame everyones malkovich when john malkovich goes in his own head wouldnt it be better to have him facing his hidden selves rather than being left to fleeting background in the lotte and maxine chase who didnt know as soon as orson beanes character explained what would happen if you got in too late how the story would endall in all a big waste of a good idea not even 1 out of 10,black_comedy
i have never seen a film so selfconscious and vain about itself so let me guess it raises questions about self and ego while hilariously lampooning the egos of stars and obsession with immortalityno not really its a laboured effort that tries too desperately hard to be weird and exists only to give critics and armchair philosophers an excuse to feel smug about themselves or laugh at the film industry injokes if you want existentialism stick to ingmar bergman or even david cronenbergbut wait it has moments charlie sheen playing himself is actually quite funny the cast generally are good but unlikable which means you dont care what happens to them or the story dont let it kid you theres no intellectualism and no satire here,black_comedy
i wanted to like this film aww heck i wanted to love it im a big fan of black comedies in general ive followed spike jonzes career for years john cusack is one of my favourite actors and cameron diaz well lets just say that my feelings towards cameron diaz are pretty much the same as every other hetrosexual males so this should have been a slam dunk i liked the concept of the film the reviews were glowing i was receptive pumped and primedthen i saw the filmand it did suck ballshuge great hairy balls of suckinessthere was not a single character i felt any affinity to i found the situations contrived and pointless the ideas explored were either  bland or annoying the acting was over the top and all i was left with was an uncomfortable desire to slap everyone involvedwas my reaction a little extreme perhaps but i dont feel too bad given that i seem to be in the minority here everyone appears to love this film people go on and on about it so if ive missed the point well my opinions are hardly going to drown out the true believers but what if im right and theyre the ones who are wrong what if there are good filmloving folks who are just embarassed to admit they dont get it what if as i suspect is true there are vast hordes of haters out there just waiting for someone to tell them that its ok not to like this filmrise up rise up you have nothing to lose but your pretensions,black_comedy
whats original about it the downtherabbit hole other world being in someone elses skin the gender bending and bending back again the movies have been doing these since the silents this was so hyped for its originality that i was actually ticked when i saw the endcredits role about as original as a sears paint job a cheeseburger or a bananapeel gag this movie was so mundane and so poorly done except for mr burwells music and a few cool camera tricks at the end that i wanted my money back and i didnt even pay to see it you want original rent rope the movie or just plain rope from a hardware store either will provide far more fun,black_comedy
terrible jokes the bad kind of genius cinematography and too many mixed metaphors and plot twists make bjm a mess just because its art doesnt make it good honestly when it was over i felt cheateddont believe the hype its an honest movie with a somewhat neat idea that gets so bogged down in metaphors and imagery and camera work and stuffy philosophical ideals and egos and ids and projected ideas of self and sorry i nodded off there for a second its got so much baggage it looses the story and worse the audience the ideals are lost on most people and they end up thinking its quirky absurd or funny not like frank zappa weird but tom green weird im a professional artist and i have friends who love this movie i make a living by making connections others dont i got the ideals of the movie i just dont think is anything close to the best movie of the last 10 years if you want odd see blue velvet odd and disturbing or pete  pete odd and funny reruns,black_comedy
i can honestly say i do not understand why anyone would like this film its incredibly strange and surreal and some people like that but even if one does i cant imagine how one would not be bored out of ones skull by this intellectimpoverished moviethe story starts out with a struggling puppeteer who gets an office job but the office is located on floor 7 12 which is between floors 7 and 8 in an office building although there is a bit in the movie that gives a pseudoexplanation for it the characters dont really believe what they are told and neither did i we never find out where floor 7 12 came from which i might have found mildly annoying if i were interested enough to care which i wasntwhile working the puppeteer finds a small doorway that leads him into john malkovichs brain the story if it werent strange already just gets stranger from there they charge people money to be john malkovich for 15 minutes and when youre done you end up on the new jersey turnpike how you get there is never explained i dont mind a bit of the surreal in a film but to have the whole entire movie be stranger than your oddest dreams is just unpleasantbut its not just the weird goingson in the movie that made me dislike it the movie was utterly boring i did not care a fig about any of the characters in it i fell asleep twice watching the dvd and had to rewind and watch the parts id slept through the second time i almost just shut it off instead if i hadnt paid my hardearned money for it i probably wouldnt have finished it to be honest theres very little reason to keep watching and i spent most of the time eyeballing the clock and hoping for it to be overif you like strange weird movies with no plot not much character development and no explanation of what is happening or why and where almost nothing happens through the whole movie then youd probably like if you dont like those things then you probably wont i dont like them so i did not like this moviemy score 110 and thats only because imdb doesnt let you give zeros,black_comedy
its on the top 250 movies of all timethat makes me want to hurl chunks the size of texas who in their right mind actually thought this movie was great true it is original but that doesnt mean its entertaining it bored me to death if you want to watch a movie that lives up to its high rating then check out the shawshank redemptionone of the greatest movies of all timehowever this one isnt id rate this one a harsh 10 if i could so i had to stick with 1,black_comedy
rubbishclever concept yes great cast yes great film oh dear im only typing now because i need 10 lines of text to be accepted this is yet again a case where the critics dare not give a damning verdict just in case they are left with egg on their faces its like a bad coldplay album  theres not many but when it is bad it still gets 10 stars through fear and not through any real substance its the same reason why eccentric art lovers pay thousands of dollars for paintings which have been made by the artist throwing paint in front of an industrial fan and letting the colour spray randomly on the canvas clever yes artistic merit  zero unfortunately if enough people tell you that something is a masterpiece there are plenty of suckers who are always going to believe it or certainly not have the balls to dismiss it this is 2 hours of painful pretentious pointless drivel i have nothing further to add your honor,black_comedy
bad bad bad i can smell this movie all the way from the video storethis movie is so bad i was so disappointed in this movie that it cannot be put into words i like john cusack i like john malkovich i even like jackass another product of the director but i hate this movieto see a movie with the promise of such creative introspection be blown to crap by such worthless writing and story development pangs my soul just the title of this movie has so much potential the writers and director could have done so much with the idea of seeing the world through someone elses eyes or knowing someone elses responsibilities for a day but noooo this movie glorifies everything that makes ours the sick culture that it can be in the end the most selfish characters in the film are rewarded with bliss and happiness the one person with any artistic vision is doomed to a life of torture and agony and one of my favorite actors looses his marbles to the voice of the hobbit look it upif you ever wanted to add more hours to your day simply skip seeing any part of this poor excuse of capitalizing on a preestablished name therenow you have the 112 minutes of my day i flushed down the toilet by watching this movie110,black_comedy
this movie was terrible it was supposed to be poke at the hollywood mob mentality and chic lifestyle it is a twisted mess of metaphors and psudoinside jokes and it comes off as a massive waste of time the fact that people buy into it is a testament to how desperately the concept has needed a vessel but this movie is not it its like an artist who is artsy trying to pick on artsy people comes off as just as elitist as it tries to make hollywood seem there is one humorous part that still makes me laugh to this day however should you have the stomach to watch this pile wait the for the malkovich malkovic malcovich part its funny its too bad john cusak was in this movie in my opinion he had a great record up to this,black_comedy
if this movie had gotten any worse i would have wanted to jump off a cliff for the normally quazibrilliant acting of both john cusak this stank it dragged too many dead spots  and the dialogue  youch  i adore john as an actor but wow  i guess everyone has their bad moments  he snapped back hi fidelity was more my taste i await future projects,black_comedy
not wishing to spoil this movie for those of you brave enough to watch  i disagree with the majority opinion that this is a good movie  i found it bizarre offensive and unrealistic  also there are many dry portions in the action where i felt a better job of tying in the major themes would have been more appropriate  overall the lack of realism and bizarre scenes in the film left my head spinning  i rate this as one of the years top three worst films that i saw,black_comedy
i also wanted to like this movie  about a third of the way through i suddenly realized that this movie sucked  at least it wasnt the nadir of suckiness that makes me reach for the remote and turn it off there was a tiny shred of curiosity that made me want to see where it wentafter it ended i thought it was sort of clever  but on further reflection i realized that thats what was wrong with it they were trying so hard to be clever  it didnt have that innate cleverness that comes from someone whos original and inventive it was that labored cleverness that makes you uncomfortable and want to turn away and not watchthe main characters craig lotte and maxine were all completely repellent  i wonder if it could have been better if they had been made more normal or likable  as others have pointed out there are so many fixes that the script needed1 star out of 10,black_comedy
i saw the movie recently because its a cult classic that id tried to see when i was young and couldnt stand it age i thought would have brought more tolerance it did i sat through the whole movie gnashing my teeth and wanting to rub all my paws together so i dont launch into the screen its wrong at so many different levels that im not sure where to begin first the art house message were supposed to get  how at different times of our lives were inhabited by or inhabit myriad different personas that the true you might only rarely or never emerge yeah its true star wars watchers have brains too we get it and still dont like it because bjm insists on taking what many have hailed as the creative route to the message but is in fact only a demented below the waist inability to draw lines spoiler alert1 it has both craig and lotte shwartz cusack and diaz in love with touchmenot catherine keener maxine lund which would be fine if it were not for the fact that both schwartzes then repeatedly enter malkovichs body solely to mate with now touchmeplease keener imagine malkovich was halle berry and try and find it funny if people inside her were making her commit sexual acts that she wasnt in control of you would essentially consider it rape if there are ways to make that look funny bjm didnt crack it 2 at a more fundamental level if the movie wanted to be different with cusacks puppeteer being different from the one usually portrayed   it failed and he isnt schwartz ends up being the same demented sad story of criminal minds and csi whos taken his own metaphors of man who pulls the strings and living in another mans skins too seriously the man whos locked his wife in a cage 3 finally there isnt even a character to connect with though mrs schwartz could have been however in the end you have her chasing and shooting at a very pregnant keener for reasons one cant really fathom all in all i think id seen my share of overrated movies but this has to be the worst of them all,black_comedy
hailed as one of the best movies of the year and even by some as one of the best in the decade feels more like it was barely given any effort at all  the film begins somewhat quirky and almost promising and the viewer knows it is in for something very different the premise also has to be given credit for originality dealing with people being transported into the mind of john malkovich  but it is all down hill after the first twenty minutes  ridiculous in its pace the film is trying to create a new genre but fails miserably  it also constantly dares the viewer to accept this bizarre land and toys with their head  it almost makes the viewer feel they have to like it because if they dont then they arent openminded or intelligent enough to live  when really the script is just stupid  the premise goes nowhere and all the seemingly great ideas proposed fall flat and are dull  not to spoil but the idea proposed of what would happen if malkovich tried to enter his own head is the most disappointing of all  and jonzes direction is as flat and bland as sugarless cotton candy  the actors are all forced to act like idiots instead of molding and creating a character  all of the stars are talented but their time is wasted with jonze who is just trying to be too hip for his own good  so in the endthe viewer is left with a story that went no where and an almost acidic trip into nothingness it seems todays critics are trying to appear on an elevated level far more intelligent than the common man by loving this film while a dud like drop dead fred had more charm than this garbage,black_comedy
sorry to all those john malkovitch lovers out there but this film really takes the biscuit at showing the actor in his worst light the puppetry work was indeed amazing and probably the films only saving grace john malkovitch is his usual creepy self and the supporting actors in this film are shown in their least flattering light  the plot was inane and pretentious and i struggled to get through the entire film through sheer boredom i personally fail to see any genius factor in this film i think the producers must have been on magic mushrooms throughout the entire project i am biased though as i really do not like jm  even though some of his films have been excellent namely dangerous liasons for one even though his character was particularly insidious dont waste your time on this lemon  it comes across as a flaccid hollywood attempt at european styled creativity  avoid,black_comedy
spoilersif anything this poor excuse for a film is a tragedyangst movie malkovich has to suffer as an outside force causes him to forever lose his mind  when the invading cusack does leave malkovich is happy to be himself one last time before having someone else invade his brain and then hes gone forever  cusacks character has his own life crumble apart after his wifediaz has an affair with someone else in malkovichs body and as a result he snaps locks her in a cage and invades john himself  things go from bad to worse as his mind is forever trapped in the daughter of his wife and her lover in the films end  i do not remember any humorous scenes in this entire film  i wont be watching this one ever againbottom line  i pretty much said everything in my review,black_comedy
this was one of the most boring and pointless movies i have ever seen in my life that bit where john malkovich enters his own head was completely daft its just weird because it wants to be not to do anything with a proper plot if there is one the movie just moved along with people having random ideas and somehow tying it all up with entering into john malkovichs headhippielooking puppeteers transsexuals midgets working between floors of an office building and people living inside peoplewhats the point,black_comedy
why oh why is there no zero on the ratings dropdown this would be on my very short list for worst movie of all timea its dumb very dumb its an unfunny oneline joke stretched out interminably the only good moment  i guess thats worth the 1 rating  is when spoiler malkovich becomes himself but thats not nearly enough for a whole movieb its smarmily cloyingly smugly artsyfartsy in a way no other movie i can think of ever pulls off it wants me to be impressed by the way the film was loaded into the camerac its boooring it goes on and on and on when i rented the dvd my wife and i watched the latter half at increasing speeds even at 32x it was really really tediousi guess the people who like this film all feel that theyre the ones clever enough to get it no sorry just gullible enough to be got by this pseudointellectual rubbish,black_comedy
i think this movie is the product of being popular simply because it is odd i read through some of the favorable reviews to see if i missed something  but apparently i didnt  granted there are a few funny moments however it quickly becomes too twisted  the characters quickly engage in deviant behavior so far fetched it is neither relatable nor enjoyable to watch rent something else,black_comedy
ohmygodohmygodohmygodohmygodwhat the heck was this load of rubbish supposed to be it has exactly two decent jokes in it that i could countokay its an interesting concept too bad noone told spike jonze how to direct films although he is good at music videos the pacing for this film for me jumped about like a man high on es this is not good filmmakingthe characters are stilted in the extreme and while normally this is a good thing and adds spice to a film not in this case everyone seems to be fixated on just one thing its not funny or interesting merely irritatingi pity the poor actors especially john malkovitch for their roles from hell how could they even try save a film with a dire script as this one hadits not all bad however the scene stop reading now if you dont want it spoiled where malkovitch enters his own subconcious was  weirdly interesting the fact that they go into a tunnel in an office building and are unceremoniously dumped next to the new jersey turnpike was one of the two decent jokes in itand now we get to the ending  where the heck was it i rewound and watched it twice and still couldnt find it yes theres some explanation for what happens but we dont see it being achieved at all badi could discuss the bad points about this film namely the film itself all day but my fingers would get tiredwhy anyone thinks this film is good is beyond my comprehension lets hope they do better next time,black_comedy
at first this movie seems great i actually thought for a while that this might be a terry gilliam film with its bizarre sets odd characters and dystopian set designs and aesthetics it was not but it seemed like it and the first third of the film was immensely enjoyable as we slowly get to know this strange worldand then they went nowhere with it sure there is a portal that leads into john malkovichs head but what they do with it is the least imaginable thing and why even john malkovich the writer charlie kaufman has said that malkovich was always his first and only choice but i just dont see why he certainly stands out because of his looks and he has the acting skills to play the different people inhabiting his head but aside from that theres nothing interesting about him shown in this film he lives in an apartment tries out for roles and thats itplus the fact that the main character is a puppeteer okay at first thats interesting its out there not something we see in every movie and jives well with the whole bizarre first third the movie has but then it is stretched way out of proportion with much of the running length dedicated to odes to puppetry why sure theres the joke about the ultimate puppet but there needs to be more than that now it barely connects with anythingthen there are the romance subplots which are passable though boring and mainly there to move the plot along the final truth about the portal is also pretty lame its pretty much what you would guess if you sat and thought for a minuteall in all was a huge disappointment for me if you have a story about a portal that allows you to control a real life hollywood star go all out dont give us this halfway there balderdash be terry gilliam make it as weird as possible attempting to put logic and cohesive narrative into it only waters it down,black_comedy
spoilerswhen i read the description of the i wasnt sure what to think im not a fan of anyone in this movie except for diaz and she was unrecognizable and acted at her worse but i did look for the movie genre which got me to watch itthere were funny parts in the very beginning like when the secretary could not hear and his boss thought he had a speech impediment but after that i found myself beyond confused 1 because the man i began to like in the movie as an awkward puppeteer trying to earn a living turned out the be so unlikable for being so comfortable with cheating on the woman who said she wanted to have kids 2 the woman he fell in love with was conceded and a home wrecker who only cared about herself i didnt like her and didnt find her demeanor humorous 3 his wife fell in love with this woman and wanted to be a man what kind of plot twist i was not interested in the hilarity i was meant to find in that situation because it was more sad that funny especially because the gun got involved twice serious not funny 4 something i said constantly throughout the movie why john malkovich hes old unattractive like everyone else in this movie creepy and irrelevant in comparison to most celebritiesall i wanted to say was why why why this movie was dreadful the worse part is the one innocent man who was being used the one i would label the protagonist malkovich will forever just be a vessel the bad guys win what no i dont find that to deserve a comedy genre title,black_comedy
i was expecting so much more john cusack and cameron diaz two of my favourite actors and a wierd plot as me and my girlfriend settled down to watch this movie on dvd we watched with an open mind to begin with the humour is strange but very funny then it gets really wierd going inside john malkovich to begin with was funny then it started to go even stupider cameron diaz started wanting to be a man the other woman would only go with john malkovich if cameron diaz was inside his head erm and thats it dont believe the hype this is pure utter garbage it is ridiculously stupid and not worth even a rental never mind a purchase,black_comedy
this may have been one of the most boring and insipid movies ive  ever seen normally i like the absurd kind of movies but this one simply went nowhere it was slow and boring and the characters were all annoying stereotypes if youre looking for a good cure for your insomnia watch this film as long as youre a mental masochist,black_comedy
i found to be an overhyped one joke comedydramastory  the film was logically inconsistent  the problem is not simply its poor logic but that that failed to tell a good or interesting story if this film exemplifies innovation then hollywood is in serious trouble the film demonstrates that hollywood is bereft of good story tellers a more interesting story might have been exploring the question of would we return to a single mind if in travelling into a new body we could bring along friends  if many people can be in one body at a time and a host body can go into another host body via the doorway then an infinite or even several repetitions of this process will lead to a lot of people in one head  if the film had explored the cosmological possibilities that the original mind was god or simply a teenager in burbank california then the story might have been of interest think of a reversed truman show if the film had explored schizophrenia then it might have been interesting  however we would probably have been watching a poor take off on the television series hermans head it scares me that people think that being is an innovative film   if the doorway into another persons head had been explored in the way that kubrick tried to study malefemale relationships through the film eyes wide shut or evolution in 2001then the film might have been interesting  alas spike jonz is no kubrick  perhaps it is too much to ask but why notanother problem was character development the character maxine max played by catherine keener major babe was under developed a golden opportunity wasted  instead we are treated to the archetypical lives of john cusack craig and cameron diaz lotte we see little of maxs life max was the most interesting character because she represented an edgier and grittier character than the gormless nearly amorphous characters played by cusack and diaz  their performances were mediocre in filling such formless characters cusack was better in say anything as lloyd dobbler  diaz while playing against type was undeveloped  she can act but not in that role  i think she was poorly cast because she was cast against type julie hagerty would have made an interesting lottethe first puppet play acts as an overture for the film and offers an intriguing start but it goes downhill from there  if the story had explored the question of identity with any integrity or focus it could have been great  the story could have explored what it is that makes us who we are  who is john malkovichis there an original or are is he are we simply a collection of separate identities that emerge periodically fight club a shallow and pretentious film explored this question with some effect unfortunately fc was a philosophically flawed film that never should have been made but that is a subject for a different reviewif being had been as gritty or as pseudohonest as fc we might have had a classic  instead we are treated to a few laughs and conned into believing that we have been included in a sophisticated tour de forcethe idea deserved a better script  the films sexual subplot was distracting  the film tried to justify this by exploring the issue of sexual attraction  the problem is not in its content but that it is so trite and really there for shock effect rather than to be meaningfully explored  are screenwriters bereft of originality and ideas that they have to troll through howard stern programswas the plot really that innovative and daring the film was about as innovative and daring as the script and dialogue for star wars to its credit sw never claimed or was spoken of as innovative in this way the story was simplistic trite and overplayed its few scenes of humor the receptionist story line like the 712 floor was funny the first time  after that it dragged  i wonder if the screenwriter was inspired by monty python stories but lacked the daring to bring off a similar farceas for its main premise that we or anyone would want to be john malkovich who cares  i have enough trouble and fun trying to find out who i am and why are other peoples lives so boring or so well understood that they have the time or the desire to be someone else  if anything demonstrates the death of imagination i suppose it would be this the films premise had potential which was its only saving grace the film could have been great if it had  explored voyeurism  i am not suggesting a crude expose like body double or a more sophisticated understanding in sex lies and videotape  or even the classic rear window but one that could explore the soul of the entertainment industrythe film could explore an industry where appearance masks a hidden reality an industry that has changed and distorted popular culture through its insistence on emphasizing the surface or the look over its content or its meaning one can understand why modern art like film rarely possess a complex thought  the result is that films and modern art simply pursue shock or the lowest common denominator sex if the film had explored the voyeuristic soul of popular culture instead of relying on the cheap and jejune titillation offered by the lesbian subplot it might have been better think of the player crossed with beingin the end the film sputters and stumbles along ending with at best a whimper  a perfect findesiecle film with its near manic attempt to appear fresh innovative and ohsofashionable but failing to mask the hidden desperation born of the realization that it possesses none of those qualities like the day after the oscars the film is a poor after image a residue of the potentialities that it could have been,black_comedy
at first this movie draws you in at first there are promises made any writer worth their salt knows better than to make promises then not keep them how this movie got its fame is beyond me shame on roger ebert for being sucked into hollywoods need to be worshiped regardless of the costif this movie is inventive i want to know why the songs i wrote as an angstridden teen arent being played on radios the world over for god sakes i could write a better script than this one and ive never written a script but one thing i am well aware of as a writer there needs to either be the standard beginning middle end or it needs to be so incredibly astounding a ride that the viewers go willingly lets just say i kicked and screamed all the way through it cursing those who gave it such high praisethe only good thing i can say about this movie is that i did not recognize cameron diaz thats an amazing trick,black_comedy
okay i wouldnt say that this movie was a total waste of time it was somewhat amusing at times  but as i write this the movie is listed as 25 in the top 250 list  i have absolutely no idea how it can have a rating that high  it was nowhere near that good  ive read several other comments here and a lot of people say what an original and fresh story it is yeah its original but not good  i like the premise but i think they could have done something more interesting with it  i kept expecting something to happen but nothing did  it seemed to just keep rolling along with no real point to it  it didnt really seem to have a message or a deep thought for us to ponder  it didnt even throw me any interesting plot twists to make me really care what was going on or to make me care about what might happen to these characters next  i did laugh quite a bit and i liked the 7 12 floor bit especially the hilariously authenticlooking orientation tape explaining the reasons the floor existed but i didnt laugh so much or find anything about it interesting enough to ever want to see it again  and i certainly wouldnt give it classic status  it was really a letdown for me  i was really looking forward to seeing it because id heard so many good things about it and because the story idea sounded so original and fresh but it was absolutely nowhere near what id hoped  i gave it a 4  if not for the few laughs it did have i wouldve rated it much much much lower  it was not particularly clever and as i said i think the movie could have been good if they had done something more with the premise,black_comedy
i would like to start off by saying that this film is extremely overrated i found some of the characters reactions to things to be extremely unrealistic and absurd i was constantly aware of the fact that i was watching a film and that can be very distracting i thought that things were overblown and extremely exaggerated in every way the reason why i gave it 310 instead of 110 is because it was a unique idea but it was poorly executed and could have been done better it is the weirdest film i have ever seen and i have seen a lot of films i have seen about 600 now i regret watching it and i expected more from cameron diaz and john cusack the acting was also bad but that could be contributed to the poor writing not the actors fault it just felt over the top for me it is supposed to be a comedy but it is almost never funny and this film has an extremely weird sense of humor and you are expected to laugh at situations that arent even funny,black_comedy
ugh what an absolutely overrated film firstly its strange and secondly its not funnyexcept one scene where a motorist throws an empty beer can at john malkovichs head that got me laughingits the sort of film that critics rant and rave about though really i cant see why a man discovers a portal its more like a tunnel really into john malkovichs head and uses him as a puppet to among other things have sex with this coworker of his but it turns out that a group of bodyjumping scientologytypes need his body to continue living and the man may be forced to give it all upor something who cares the plot to this movie was possibly lost in the beforementioned tunnel because really theres nothing that memorable about this film john malkovich as john malkovich is rather humdrum except for the fact hes fun to watch and has a handful of good lines john cusack and catherine keener are both average actors and neither of them turns in a particularly likable performance charlie kaufman is a talented writer and did wonders with adaptation but this film just isnt worth the hype original yes but funny no rewatchability zero it feels like a porno and probably wouldnt of even got a mention if it had been say being ice cubewhat a waste,black_comedy
im not sure how this film made it into the top 250 there are no real laughs in this film maybe a couple quick halfhearted chuckles now and then the idea explored in this film is original sure its also absurd yes i know its just a movie and its not supposed to be a realistic idea  and that is fine with me because absurd ideas can still be the basis for a great filmthis was not a great film i can be a pretty sick guy sometimes and ive been known to sometimes laugh at terrible things but something about the way malkovichs body is taken over while pushing his real personality to the side to be forever doomed to go insane watching himself be remote controlled all while helpless to stop it really makes me a bit disgusted i think the reason why is because its portrayed in kind of a positive light where we should laugh at the despair if that wasnt the case i would have been fine with itand then there are the pretty fked up sexual themes i really just did not like this movie at all there was real possibility for some deep examination of the idea and humanity in general but instead its exploited for some attempts at cheap humor on top of all this none of the characters are even remotely likable i do not recommend this one to anybody not sure how it got anywhere near the top 250 very disappointedit managed only one genuine laugh from me in the whole thing the part where everybody has the head of malkovich when he goes inside himself that was clever and disturbingly hilarious,black_comedy
i hated this movie  it started out fine but then the relationship between lotte and maxine just freaked the cp out of me  this movie was horrible it struggled to have a plot and just crapped along through 113 minutes of sheer agony for me,black_comedy
a truly original example of movie making the concept of the movie is very refreshing and the gags are fresh and funnygreat direction great cast and overflowing with fresh ideas this film is a breath of fresh airthere is a problem though it is certainly not for everyone it is very weird and is more likely to attain a cult status in movie history than it is to become a true classicthat said i did enjoy it immensely and would recommend it to every movie lover who fancies something a little differenttry it you might like it and if you dont what have you lost 810,black_comedy
is an odd little dark comedy which is slightly open to interpretation but deals with themes like identity manipulation sex and neuroses the acting is excellent  but nothing less should have been expected from this cast the screenplay is also very good as is the direction and editing the film moves along at a comfortable pace relying more on the somewhat obscure messages embedded in the intriguing plot than on characters plotline action or intellectjohn cusack plays a control freak whose obsession manifests itself in his choice of an unsuccessful career  as a puppeteer cameron diaz plays his wife a passive woman with little selfdetermination and a very big heart catherine keener plays a shallow jetsetter cusack and later diaz becomes obsessed with john malkovich plays john malkovich sort ofone of the challenging aspects of this film is that none of these characters with the exception of malkovich himself are very likable they all do drugs obsess on their own fantasies and have rather warped selfconcepts of the three principals i chose to like diaz character most simply because she loved animals so muchin any case the plot is basically a bit of postmodern twilight zone scifi with a somewhat more linear and conventional story line than some of the more challenging material in postmodern cinema ie eraserhead lost highway mulholland drive the success of this film is probably largely due to its inherent rationality  like memento it feels weird and moody but is really based on a pretty simple if somewhat silly conceptby entering a tiny tunnel in an office on the 75th floor of an office building where cusack and keener work you can become john malkovich for fifteen minutes unless you are a puppetmaster in which case you can possess the legendary actor for the remainder of his life to reveal any more of the plot would require a spoiler so i will stop here however i want to write a little about the general themes the film comments onbjm points out a relationship between puppetry and acting though clever and cleverly portrayed this connection is really rather superficial and pedanticbjm has a queer concept of morality and control while the question of what happens to malkovich throughout the film is hardly asked at all the film seems to say that overtly attempting to control others is a bad thing while doing so passively is really quite okbjm definitely has a druginduced flavor to it i havent smoked dope in many years but this film is the sort of thing i used to write while high from the amount of potsmoking references in the film i also got the feeling that at least the writer considered it a major part of his lifethis is a really neat little surrealismlite film its far from a masterpiece but definitely worth seeing,black_comedy
i just watched this movie and i have to say its one of the worst movies i have ever seen  i saw it because it had many good reviews  all the way through the movie i kept thinking it would have to get good how could so many movie reviewers be wrong  but it never got good  the monitor just continued spewing the same garbage off the screen  i lost respect for a lot of movie critics while watching this movie  how can so many people believe that this is a good movie  the top things i look for in a movie in order are1 good storylineplot2 directingcamera movement3 symbolism metaphor or other uses of allegory4 intelligence5 acting skillill admit that the acting wasnt that bad in this movie but the plot was downright awful the directing was basic at best and i saw no sign of literary devices  and there was absolutely no intelligence before i saw this movie i still had respect for cameron diaz  now whenever i watch something about mary not a great film but fairly good i cant stop thinking about her role in this lousy movie  the only good part of this movie was that the puppeteering was kind of cool  other than that this movie was a complete waste of my time,black_comedy
has it all  comedy drama romance and a whole lot more  but more importantly it is original  and when i mean original i mean this film is the most original piece of work ive seen in decades  nothing like this has ever been made and seeing how its original nothing like it will ever be made again  and this is for three reasons1 the acting which is some of the best of the year and then some  john cusack in a warped role as the odd puppeteer cameron diaz as his pet store working wife katherine keener as the devilish office worker and as himself in his best role ever john malkovich as the only person he could perfectly play himself2 the script which is the most original funny and odd one in years to come around  who couldve ever thought of a normal person going into the brain of an famous oscar nominated actor and coming out on the side of the new jersey turnpike  and when malkovich goes inside the portal into his own brain he finds a whole restaurant full of himselfs  i think that is weirder than anything you could see in youre entire life when not on drugs     and 3 the director spike jonze  this is spike jonzes first adventure into feature films he was and still is and actor and music video director and it is probably what he will be most remembered for  unlike some other directors spike doesnt take a scene and go on to another he actually expands on his ideas and works with them to their maximum potential  along with a funny script a surprise at every turn and a hilarious cameo with charlie sheen this film is definitely in my top ten of the year and the decade  magnefike  a,black_comedy
this off beat comedy is probably the best movie ive seen in the last 18 months regardless of whether the story is original i enjoyed thinking of the possibilities the plot brought up it was presented in an interesting and creative manner and had excellent performances from the castthe scene with the secretary and then the boss on the seven and a half floor was one of the great scenes in cinema,black_comedy
this is one of those odd little films that is near impossible to critique a fantasy of sorts about a struggling puppeteer john cusack who takes a job at a strange office where he starts to work with an odd 105yearold boss orson bean and a beautiful but heartless coworker oscarnominee catherine keener the office itself has sixfoot ceilings and is located on the seven and a half floor the weirdness does not stop when cusack goes home as his wife an almost unrecognizable cameron diaz is struggling working with her animals as a type of researcher and questions her own sexuality and dreams of perhaps having a sex change one day still with me cusack becomes disenchanted with diaz and falls for the cold keener meanwhile he finds a passageway which leads to the mind of john malkovich through the office he tells diaz and keener and more confusion ensues diaz now is even more sexually confused and keener comes up with a plan to make money off the discovery by charging admission to all comers who wish to see what malkovich sees for 15 minutes keener falls in love with the body of malkovich diaz falls in love with the possibility of being malkovich all the time and cusack wants keener at all costs malkovich learns of what is going on but what can he do cusack discovers how he can get keener go into malkovich and stay there forever this will also launch the career in puppeteering that he so desperately wants however boss orson bean and some of his other ridiculously elderly friends have had plans the whole time to take over malkovichs body and live forever but cusacks plans have gotten in the way now they will do whatever possible to jump into malkovich to keep from dying there are so many oddball situations that the viewers head may be spinning trying to keep it all straight there are undertones aplenty in this film medical cloning lesbianism sexual obsession sexchange operations sexual threesomes the question of mindcontrol physical attractions mental deficiencies the rights of individuals the mad world of media the exploration of quick moneymaking schemes the exploration of relationships in the workplace and the general disdain of individuals in the workplace are all somewhat explored subjects in some subjects are subtle while others slap you in the face in all the film is a fantasy for the 1999 crowd the only difference is that it deals with subjects that have been or could be more prevalent to the real world spike jonze shows real potential here with his direction this was far from a easy film to put together charlie kaufman must also be given kudos for a creative screenplay it is not quite a great script but it is definitely interesting and unique the performers are also good john malkovich does well with a strange role john cusack continues to show real versatility cameron diaz does her best but seems a bit outofplace in a film like this at times catherine keener is the bolt of lightning that keeps everyone on their toes her oscar nomination was welldeserved there are also cameos galore big surprise sean penn and charlie sheen are among those who make token appearances throughout the film many have said that is a film that will mean more in the future i am not sure about this i doubt that it will be as trailblazing as say 2001 a space odyssey this is a unique experience that is a curiosity the fact that it will have so many tireless imitations will not help its case either 4 stars out of 5,black_comedy
ah poor john malkovich if you thought truman burbank had it rough in the truman show with the entire world watching his every televised move then your heart really has to go out to this guy at the very least truman was always able to keep his inner mind sacred and untouched but poor malkovich doesnt even have that ability hes stuck with all these depraved eccentrics invading his privacy and making a huge pile of dollars at his expense and hes completely powerless to stop them that malkovich is a reallife actor he even played alongside cusack before in con air living in this warped fictional world makes it all the more haunting its hard not to come away from this one feeling just a little unnerved  the concept it revolves around is after all undeniably grotesque riddled with plot points which are just plain absurd and which the characters themselves except for malkovich accept all too readily for example why would you be spat out by the side of the new jersey turnpike of all places and the final outcome of their escapade is outrageously creepy and harrowing to say the least  but paradoxically the film is also fun hilarious and really has its charmand that i suppose is the beauty of bjm  no logic no ethics no philosophy craig does briefly deliberate on the philosophical implications of his discovery but is persuaded by maxine to brush them aside pretty quickly in favour of cashing in on it just loads of twisted surrealism and great laughs and a movie so delightfully insane that it boggles the mind there could be a little message somewhere in there about the worldliness of modern society and our materialistic drive to make money out of whatever we can our human fascination with celebrities and beliefs that their lives are more fulfilling than our own and in the case of the oddball old dr lester refusal to face up to our own mortality but even there everything is skewered as further dark comedy the morals of the story are almost a joke but darn good ones at that and for best results you really have to detach your mind beforehand sit back and just enjoy this for being the lavish and crazy piece of farce it invariably is its daring imaginative and wonderfully unconventional and comes complete with some of the most memorable characterisations of the late 90s the deep eccentricity of some the characters may cause them to seem a little distant at first but they do grow on you and i know that anyone can identify with the dejected puppeteer craig schwartz and his struggle for recognition on some level granted a film about a group of people who discover a portal leading into an actors brain was hardly going to be everyones cup of kenco and i dont anticipate that everyone who sees it will share my enthusiasm but for those of us who like our movies to be just that bit different this is a psychotic little masterpiece to be savouredafter all its impossible to deny the appeal of a movie where most of the human characters are acting essentially like instinctdriven animals concerned primarily with selfsurvival andor attracting a mate contrasting with a subplot which concerns a young chimpanzee gradually learning to come to terms with his repressed childhood trauma throw in some of the most brilliantlytimed cameo appearances from sean penn and brad pitt ever captured on film and you know you have a winner on your hands this has future cult classic written all over itah poor john malkovich ah poor craig  grade a,black_comedy
and i dont mean that the movie is weird i like that everyone should appreciate the freshness of this movie what i mean is that the screenplay is a little uneven when i first saw this film on opening day luckily i liked it a lot but felt that there was a major problem it took me months to figure out why i felt this way but i did finally figure it out and i have confirmed it on subsequent viewings the first half hour or so all the screen time before the portal is found contains an entirely different humor than the rest of the picture and this humor is mostly childish and unfunny the secretary and the joke about her being an expert on speaking disabilities was very unfunny i feel embarrassed when i watch it its so bad the video about why the 7 12 floor exists is also extremely unfunny as well as the 7 12 floor itself i didnt find any of these things funny and there were even more than that i did like the puppet show that craig gave on the street corner i did like dr lesters sexual rantings although dirty old men jokes are really commonplace and i laughed a lot when craig was guessing maxines namefortunately when the portal is found the childish humor pretty much completely vanishes the rest of this movie is very intelligent every joke hits there are no misses like there are in the first half hourbut what is really special about this film is how smoothly it becomes a compelling drama and character study it is so well filmed watch how the craig lottie and maxine dolls are used all through the film i really felt it when maxine was covering up the lottie puppet i actually teared up during the chase through malkovichs subconscious which i think is probably the single best scene that appeared in a film in 1999 and i also wept at the very very very beautiful ending the second time i saw this in a theater they cut out the beginning of the credit sequence where emily was swimming and i absolutely screamed telling everyone in the theater about the sham that had been pulled and i found the ending even more startling on the third viewing because i hadnt realized what actually happened to craig at the end on my first and second viewings i love this movie so i am very hurt by the childish humor in the first half hour it does embarrass me it detracts from the whole film overall i have to give it a 910,black_comedy
the first time i started to watch i stopped it looked like something i wasnt in the mood for maybe never would be there was this puppet show i tried again another day and discovered one of my alltime favorite movies my alltime favorites dont necessarily include alltime favorite performances but this one does catherine keener is inspired and perfectly entertaining as the quirky kinky loveinterest for ultimateloser john cusack im certain theres never been a movie like this before and it stands repeated viewing in a completely unique way cameron diaz is virtually unrecognizable as cusacks neurotic wife orson bean you read correctly is sublimely cast in a crucial role john malkovich is hilariously flabbergasted at whats going on whatever it is this is not a comedy just outrageously hilarious its kind of a love story but again not like any youve ever seen or conceived of its refreshingly ultrastrange,black_comedy
this had an interesting premise and an interesting cast too bad the movie was so stupid and unappealing with tons of liberalsecular propaganda foul mouthed women and a dirty old manfor the record the profane females were cameron diaz and catherine keener the latter is that way in every movie ive ever seen with her in it that is one nasty woman the dirty old man is orson bean who illustrates once again that the older actors werent exactly much more pure than todays they just language restrictionsi thought the movie was interesting until diaz takes a trip into malkovichs head then the film gets extremely annoying dialogwise critics liked this movie because 1 it was different and 2 it was irreverent,black_comedy
what makes provoke so deeply is that it is not simply an oddball flight of fancy but an exploration of charlie kaufmans deeply realized questions and thoughts explored through the story however the film is certainly pathological in its exploration of themes and modus operandi in ways that are not done in american movies its romantic plot strands its ending the subplot of revitalizing the art of puppeteering and the nonchalance of the characters workplace having low ceilings because of being placed between two normal floors are all either farreachingly hilarious eccentric ideas much like ones one may conjure when half asleep yet still conscious and visions and even scenarios bleed into your actual environments or they are aggressively resentful of pat plot tunescusack very comfortably plays a character created by forces not afraid of a hero whos blunderingly unsuccessful with women or not very socially popular a dark territory where ego has to reach a little bit to get a hold cusack kaufman and director jonze knew that more people would identify with him much more intensely and honestly than a confident clever attractive man hes the id of the creators of the traditional leading man and consequently the men whove grown up latently emulating them cameron diaz has the same attitude towards her role the personification of the basic drives feelings and impulses of the most headturning social women kaufmans characters are amoral and egocentric ruled just by pleasure and painlike all films there is the love interest and subsequently the love triangle but its not there to fill in any blanks the female characters are not decoration but very invigorating and thoughtprovoking characters catherine keener owner of the most beautiful smile ever captured on film eats up the screen just as i would like her to do with me as a cruelly unattainable object of desire rejecting not as a reaction but as a first movejonze was wise not to employ the safety net of the inventive and meticulously coordinated style of the fascinating music videos he has directed and instead trusts the effect of kaufmans inspiring script to stand alone without disaffecting visual technique lathered on top this film is a highly admirable and important onslaught that hopefully by now has hemorrhaged its influence into the much expressed overcommercialization and underused creativity and exploration of american cinema,black_comedy
what an amazing movie theres nothing like it anywhere if you havent already seen it do so the next chance you get the ideas in this film are plentiful enough for an entire television show and several spinoffs of it i wont even say anything about the plot of this movie or the premise im sure you already know it anyway nothing i say here can prepare you for how unique entertaining and mindbending this movie is the movies script truly outweighs any of its stars and shows that theres always ideas out there,black_comedy
my second viewing of this film revealed a depth i had not noticed in the first time around the movie officially is filed under the comedy label and it certainly does seem so if we remember the scene where malkovich enters his own portal or the dark bits of humor regarding schwartz unfortunate life but it actually goes a long way over to explore the obscurities of ones subconscious mind ive been a long time fan of charlie kaufmans fantastic creativity and talent to put together the most fantastic and strange stories he had me at eternal sunshine of the spotless mind and its hard not to remember joel  clementine looking for a safe place to hide from the eraser guys as we watch people come and go in and out of john malkovichs mind and its layers that kaufman picked him to be the protagonist is curious as hes not a particular hollywood alist and one could even say very randombut i guess that is part of the bittersweet humor of the story toocameron diaz was barely recognizable and i think its great that so many good actors are a part of this i guess its a script  and an opportunity to do something different that only comes along every now and then at times the humor exceeds the tragic but funny line and becomes just tragic like the memories we find visiting malkovichs mind or the scene where schwartz ties up lotte and keeps her in the cage in order to be with maxine everyone seems to be unhappy with their place in life and trying desperately to move on but in the move they end up being hurt and mislead by each otherfunny thing is that john malkovichs head should be the catalyst for them to do soi confess im not very fond of the alien masterminding subplot behind the portals origin because its just too weird but what in this movie isnt i guess that was better than the portal remaining unexplained so i try to pass it over and look at the innovative project it is,black_comedy
the film is deeply funny because of the grossness of the concrete realization of the argument of the plot it is muddy dirty crawling in a corridor perverting in the most grotesque way alice in wonderland looking through the looking glass and sharing an apartment with an illmouthed parrot and a chimpanzee the hole in the hedge is a rat hole in the wall and the only attractive thing in it is the glass doorknob then the plot is absolutely funny it is based on one person being able to crawl inside another person and impose his or her personality onto that other person thats strange but very fast it becomes ah ah because of the identity of the person inside and the identity of the person with whom the inhabited one is having relationships discussions rapports even intercourse of course in a way it is perverted since a woman can live her love for another woman by accepting her to be in the man that is the vessel of that intruder or invader if the man is invaded by a woman and has a personal relationship with another woman the two women are making love to the point of procreating a girl their daughter thats definitely ah ah then the film deals with phantasms in the heads of western men and women everyone wants to be able to make their desires and emotions towards anyone whatsoever real but after all you have to keep some appearances as a british tv series about a certain mrs bouquet used to say and thats how the inhabited human vessel can enable so many possible connections to take place then it shows that success in our society does not depend on the value you have but on the value the public persona you are living in has if you live in the body of a great person anything you will do will be successful and seen at once as great finally and thats the punch scene at the end of the film this possibility to transit from one person to another will enable some old people to get into younger bodies and live forever the very fundamental myth of the western world but a myth they have never dared to realize in a religious belief or philosophical theory the buddhist did it but not the christians nor the moslems nor the jews the three semitic religions so hollywood is playing the role of the provider of eternity to the few who will believe it because they have always dreamed of it blessed be the gullible  so all in all a funny film that makes you feel at times kind of ill at easedr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne  university versailles saint quentin en yvelines,black_comedy
if anything i enjoy the audacity and manic creativity of this 1999 black comedy more now than when it was first released screenwriter charlie kaufman who sends up the creative block he experienced after writing the films script in 2002s adaptation plainly refuses to use any accepted cinematic convention to tell the wildly eccentric story of craig schwartz a downtrodden puppeteer who has a mustbeseentobebelieved adventure an uncompromising artiste who cannot find work within his craft he decides to accept a job as a file clerk to please his frumpy animalloving wife lotte things immediately go awry when he sees his place of employment is on the dwarfsized 7 12th floor of a manhattan office building he becomes drawn to an icecold coworker an apparent femme fatale named maxine but the story really escalates into high gear when he discovers a secret passageway that turns out to be the consciousness of actor john malkovichthe plot convolutions only get weirder yet strangely more resonant as craig and others get to experience including the actor himself what subsequently happens is constantly offkilter but kaufman brings perceptive insight into all the major characters in ways that are completely unpredictable the beauty is that repeated viewings only bring out plot nuances that were not as apparent the previous times director and sometime actor spike jonze is an inspired choice to lead the proceedings since he lends an almost veritstyle to the film making the lunacy seem humansized casting is pure gold with a bedraggledlooking john cusack appropriately awestruck as craig a castagainsttype cameron diaz energized by her curiosity as lotte and catherine keener sharply feline as maxine orson bean brings out all the eccentricities of craigs oddly deranged boss and no one is better cast than malkovich as a wildly narcissistic version of himself especially as the plot spins further into a freudian fantasy of monstrous proportionsthis is wildly inventive filmmaking that may alienate several viewers but it really should be embraced as the kind of bold experimentation that mainstream hollywood rarely attempts the 2002 dvd extras are also pure gold including an interview with jones conducted under mockstress a brief featurette an intimate portrait of the art of puppeteering that spotlights the behindthescenes work performed by puppet master phil huber and a short called intimate portrait of the art of background driving which purportedly documents the experiences of extras driving cars in the new jersey turnpike scenes where all of the malkovich travelers end up along with the original theatrical trailer and several tv promotional spots there are also two playedstraight videos excerpts of which are shown in the film  one the 7  floor orientation and the other the vaunted pseudodocumentary american arts and culture presents john horatio malkovich dance of despair and disillusionment a genuinely entertaining package overall,black_comedy
a bold statement to be sure especially coming from someone whose only credentials are the fact that he is a movie fanatic  i am not a scholar  i am not a professor or an analyst or an insider  i talk about a movies power to me personally not to a demographic  and i am here to tell you this film is brilliant  it is inventive  it is smart  it is sharp  it is bizarre and dark and mesmerizing in a few places  it is truly unique and ingeniusand i am truly deeply saddened by the many viewer comments that seem to overlook these qualities and instead comment on how they saw the film as murky or complex or insignificant  i was especially depressed at how one user commented that malkovichs performance in con air was superior to his performance in this film  comparing this film with con air is like comparing alien with attack of the killer tomatoes and saying killer tomatoes was a better monster movieplease i am eager to defend my views on this film it is a masterpiece that will be remembered as a watershed for the film industry  if you dissent whether personally or professionally i welcome the opportunity to try to change your opinion,black_comedy
outlines fundamental desires and problems that our modern society is dealing with catching out the observer by confronting him with moral taboos main difficulties are regarding voyeurism immortality identity and sexual covetousness the whole movie is an evolution starting with voyeurism in general to voyeurism in its strongest occurrence concerning real prominent persons in particular it then raises questions of identity who we want to be and how we can achieve what we desire just to open out and close with the deep human wish of immortality paired with its negative side of endlessness along the way puts this in a surreal and kafkaesque setting this excelling movie is often underrated by the audience while still being above the ordinary the high potential rooted in the plot takes time to emerge and therefore needs to be watched at least twice,black_comedy
is a zany and uncompromisingly brilliant black comedy that boasts something very few american films can claimoriginality charlie kaufmans imaginative oscarworthy screenplay centers around an unemployed puppeteer named craig john cusack in a delightfully unhinged turn who gets a job as a file clerk at a company called lestercorp which is lodged between the 7th and 8th floors of an office building craig discovers a hole in the wall of his office which turns out to be a portal into the mind of actor john malkovich which allows those who enter to view the world from malkovichs mind for 15 minutes at which time they are then deposited at the side of the road on the new jersey turnpike to reveal anymore of the story would be wrong for the uninitiated but suffice it to say that director spike jonz has mounted a quirky and unpredictable roller coaster ride which keeps the viewer constantly guessing and consistently entertained cusack receives solid support from catherine keener smart and vivacious in her oscarnominated turn as maxine craigs partnerincrime with whom he falls in love cameron diaz as craigs dizzy wife lottie and of coursemalkovich himself who deserves major kudos for allowing us to laugh along with him at himself and his image a once in a lifetime cinematic experience,black_comedy
i was curious to watch this movie since i read its plot synopsis but i never thought it would be so good i mean this film is great some people say its a just shameful autopromotion by john malkovich but who cares if its so just let it be because i dont care if the title is or being cameron diaz or even being the pope  what really matters here is the movies concept its original idea and its message to the viewer and about that i must say you something its really fantastic one of the best movies ive seen latterly by hollywood the plot is original fresh and really different from what ive seen so far at the beginning i just felt oddness because the story was completely senseless out of any possible and reasonable logic and to increase even more this feeling of strangeness it had an alternative kind of humor which passed too many times from the hilarity to the absurdity but it was great either i can remember that scene when lotte cameron diazs character says i think its kind of sexy that john malkovich has a portal you know its sort like he has a vagina its sort of vaginal like he has a penis and a vagina lol thats crazy stuff man but if the first part of the movie is completely strange and out of any logic the second part start giving us some answers a bit crazy too but at least with a little logic the performances of the four main actors are great too john cusack cameron diaz catherine keener and john malkovich did excellent actingthis film was really refreshing and innovative its good to see hollywood making alternative and excellent movies again,black_comedy

bizarre thats the first word that came to my mind as i reflected on this film indeed the most common muttering that i heard among my friends with whom i was watching the film who i admit had no idea what they were going to be watching and had never heard of the film was what the fk i kept my incredulity to myself but i largely shared their sentiment its a film about surprising huh a man struggling to make ends meet as a puppeteer finds a job filing things on floor 7  of a building which happens to be half a floor where everything is miniaturized and all the people working there have to stoop he discovers a small door that leads directly to the inside of john malkovich where you can be him for 15 minutes after which you fall from the sky onto a spot pleasantly situated next to the new jersey turnpike soon the puppeteer and a coworker with whom he is in love although he is married start charging admission to regular schmoes who want to be someone else for fifteen minutes a bizarre love triangle develops between the puppeteer his wife and the coworker and somehow john malkovich is worked in there as the puppeteer and his wife vie for time being him so that they can then be with the coworker now before this plot gets any more convoluted and confusing to the unknowing reader im going to forgo the growing plot and im going to jump to the meaning and the profundity of the film which is actually the most fun partthis film tackles one of the most existentially challenging and profoundly interesting and intense enigmas of humanity what is the essence of self is it possible to see the world through someone elses eyes and yet remain oneself if you are someone else for a time then what are you replacing and what happens to that whom youve replaced and what happens to your body if youve left yourself to be someone else strangely enough this film seems to answer all these questions in as strange a manner as any other answer could possibly be it puts forth a logical well almost system in which one can be someone else and it provides for any question the viewer could have about the process it even raised a question that i had not even thought of and answered it itself what happens when a person is himself that is what happens when john malkovich goes through the door to himself well suffice it to say that the result blew my mind and was hysterical at the same time it was a very bizarre answer but as good an answer as any otherthis film is like nothing ive been exposed to before i keep repeating at the ends of my reviews that if a film doesnt make you think its not worth your time that still holds true for this film perhaps even more than any other but not like any other ive seen before other films have messages about life they teach the viewer something about life or some way to live or something the director or writer has learned that he wants to impart unto the viewer this film does that as well and more it does blatantly warn of the troubles involved with wanting to be someone else the whole concept of being another person is simply impossible and only a dream as evidenced by the dreamlike setting of the little door a floor half the normal size however this film was more than a life lesson it simply makes you think and thats fun it proposes a philosophical puzzle and proposes a genuinely entertaining solution however attacking a philosophical puzzle such as this one is seemingly impossible to do on film short of showing three older men in smoking jackets amiably discussing the issue over sherry in front of a blazing fire therein lies evidence of the immense skill involved in making this film another remark that i heard from a friend as we watched the film was what kind of a person thinks of this stuff the answer is a genius truly only a person of extraordinary thought and inventiveness could imagine such a film furthermore great filmmaking was employed as well i still cant figure out how they filmed things through malkovichs eyes i suppose they couldve taped a camera to his head but that doesnt explain how malkovich looked at himself in the mirror with no place for a camera to hide regardless it was pretty fancy camera work in fact the camera work was quite masterful for much of the film as things became mentally tumultuoushowever the crowning jewel of this film as ive mentioned before is the writing both the storyplot and the dialogue the characters are so odd the story so strange and the dialogue so out there that one cant help but enjoy this film it is meant to be a comedy and it certainly is one the oddness and awkwardness just make you laugh i nearly forgot to mention the fascinating performances by all the actors in the film particularly the awkward puppeteer played masterfully by john cusack and his eccentric wife played surprisingly well by cameron diaz and how could i forget john malkovich himself who does an exemplary job playing himself and playing well himself but possessed by another this is really a fun movie to watch to think about and discuss the makers especially spike jonze and charlie kaufman and the entire cast and crew deserve a firm pat on the back and all those who havent seen it deserve a firm word of encouragement go see this film and be prepared to exclaim what the fk and remember if it doesnt make you think its not worth your timemichael,black_comedy
one has to wonder how they came up with the idea for this movie but that could distract from the movie itself is so hilarious in every way that i cant even describe it you have to see it to believe it as one of the many movies along with the blair witch project the sixth sense and american beauty which affirmed that 1999 was to my generation what 1967 was to my parents generation thanks to bonnie and clyde in the heat of the night and the graduate this is one movie that you cant afford to miss it may have very well been the coolest movie of 1999 and it certainly affirmed john malkovich as one of the great actors of our time,black_comedy
this film has a densely layered plot with plenty of insight into the human mind john malkovich is a vessel literally and metaphorically the discovery of the portal amplifies the true nature of each character craig the puppeteer craves the acceptance of the public for his talent lotte his wife lives to care for her animals but ultimately wants a child maxine the woman both lotte and craig claim to love believes her beauty is worth the status she lacks malkovich is the means by which they believe happiness is possibleis very applicable to this digital age of live celebrity updates and involvement with the public many wish they were someone who had more freedom to do whatever they wanted in their relationships profession and overall life craig lotte and maxine are all out for themselves seeing malkovich as an opportunity and not a human being walking in someone elses shoes is traditionally viewed as a chance to understand another person but in this case it is exploited for narcissistic agendas only one character in the movie has true compassion for other human beings and it is elijah their pet monkey,black_comedy
being malkovich is a very disappointing movie you have trusted the seemingly good cast and as you will have to admit to yourself this was indeed a huge mistake you have trusted the academy yet another time  you are not learning from your mistakes no plot or originality be here really there are some ideas all in a row like for example the offices in which you can only walk bentcould work out really in some futuristic drama or in alice in wonderland the third sequel but it does not here the doorway to another persons life although much harder to believe but it could still work out somewhere some place it does not here from which passageway you are dumped to a ditch after 15 minutes besides a motorway sounds quite appealing right the ideas do not add up to anything worth watching the creators are testing our intelligence lets show them we have one simply dont watch or in case you have do not recommend this movie,black_comedy
i am a movie fanatic i love movies i admit i am not a critic i would make a lousy critic just for the sheer fact i like pretty much every movie i see and i couldnt even make it all the way through this movie the plot was somewhat interesting the acting was great but the way the idea was executed was just plain stupid the characters were just stupid wannabes who couldnt get a hold of their own pathetic lives sure were all like that but these guys were so eccentric i couldnt stand to watch certain scenes were disgustingly pointless and the characters were not sympathetic making this movie futile sure there was a good joke thrown in every now and then but they were almost impossible to laugh at when you remembered what you were actually sitting through i dont recommend this movie out there to anyone who has a brain if i could give it a zero i would,black_comedy
not having a 95 i vote 10 its just about as good as a film can get when a film is completely immersive then it is great when a film leaves me in a completely altered state it is fabulous of course this is totally subjective i was so caught up in this film that when it was over i literally could not find my way out of the theater that is the degree to which i became immersed and altered there are only three or four films that have ever done that to me i cannot seem to find any flaws to this film which left me completely surprised at each twist and turn from each absurd parody of lifes mundane reality to the unreal bending of fantasy stretched to its breaking point  this movie accomplishes what few have i loved it,black_comedy
theyre better plots in godzilla films   a tunnel to jms braincome on once again its supposed to be the new genre of films where anything is possible some cheap jokes about his penis  acting is ok no standouts not believable  star warsthats believable  and i kept wondering why john malkovich  why not someone interesting,black_comedy
spike jonzes wittilywritten incredibly acted comedy drama about a disgruntled but ambitious puppeteer who to his amazement finds a peculiar mystical portal into the mind of john malkovich is a brilliantly surreal and mind boggling experience its profoundly original dreamlike narrative exploring humanities selfishness and ones desire to be something else makes it constantly entertaining and builds up to an utterly unforgettable cinematic experience charlie kaufmans clever yet non selfindulgent script creates some very awkward but hilarious situations for the characters and flawlessly disguises the insane feebleness and fantasy of the story and its characters infinitely believable he went on to work with director michel gondry and wrote his masterpiece eternal sunshine of the spotless mind which i think is one of the best films ever made he is arguably one of the most talented arthouse writers out there today and although he makes very few films the ones that he does work on are always brilliant in the interesting case of performancewise it is perfect cameron diaz and john cusack advertise some fantastic chemistry but the greatest standout is easily john malkovich who is just perfect and undeniably engaging at beingplaying john malkovich catherine keener is also great as the bitterly inhuman antihero and jonzes outstanding direction nails the film as a landmark i think its one of the best directorial debuts of all time and if your not laughing at it or being moved by it youll certainly be admiring it its a strange and emotionally detaching screen presence but in my opinion its one of the best of its kind endlessly fascinating and completely extraordinary,black_comedy
so much has been written  i will just add that the scene where malkovitch becomes malkovitch may be the funniest scene in film history this is one of those movies that is not possible to understand the first viewing both john cusack and john malkovich are on my favorite actor shortlist some of the little details are hilarious  just for example  when cusack ties up cameron diaz the chimp is kissing her and you can just make out her kissing the chimp back underneath the tape malkovichs depiction of having cusack speak within him is classic along with his physical comedy its a triumph for him there are so many little tidbits like this that it would take hours to detail them all the malkovich being malkovich just seems so welldone with the midgetmalkovich the childmalkovich the maitred malkovich the women malkoviches the gay malkovichwhat a scene malkovich malkovich,black_comedy
cusack plays a creatively frustrated puppeteer who must take a desk job to make ends meet and subsequently discovers a secret portal into the mindseye of john malkovich between two floors in the building in which he works though married he becomes enamoured by the sultry coworker keener and eager to impress her uses the secret portal as his hook prompting the entrepreneurial vixen to devise a plan to sell experiences ranging from the mundane  like eating breakfast  to more cultural immersions like pov of the beast with two backs through the portal to rake a profit matters become complicated when both cusack and keener compete for the power over malkovichs subconsciousness causing jealousy to emergeits the sort of movie youll either appreciate or dismiss as a selfindulgent abstraction and while the concept is occasionally difficult to absorb the plot is much easier to digest the puppetry featured in this movie is exceptional even if you dont possess an interest in the art the dexterity with which the puppeteer phillip huber makes his marionette performers interact is magicalkeener is a seductive and ultimately brash characterisation and should fog up your face furniture particularly one scene with malkovich while cusack plays his ubiquitous alterego the intellectual manchild consumed by neuroticism urban paranoia struggling to define himself amongst the masses another watchable if somewhat familiar portrayal malkovich makes a typically arrogant namesake but as always his enigmatic eccentric appeal makes for a quirky offbeat but entertaining picture unlikely to reach the masses but a boldly interesting subject just the same for those whod dare,black_comedy
three characters living mundane lives find themselves with the strangest of opportunities we see them evolve into hypocritical selfish and brutally honest souls who turn a portal into john malkovich into a introspective amusement park for their developing love tryst alongside a bizarre existence of others living a secret eternal life charlie kaufmans script is a maze of self searching ultimately exposing the dream of being someone else as false escape director spike jonze captures desperation of self and sympathizes with a struggle familiar to many of us playing with people this is an intriguing exposure of unfulfilled lives that grows more intense with every viewing,black_comedy
i introduce this movie the name is this is the most difficult movie ive ever seen the story starts out when a puppeteer is searching a job later he gets a job and finds a hole leads into john malkovichs head he tried to use this hole and tried to make big money main person are john cusack and cameron diaz and john malkovich at first i couldnt notice that puppeteers wife is cameron diaz because of her ugly makeup this movie has so many topics human moral philosophyplease try it when you have time and try to think about human,black_comedy
a bizarre and deliciously inventive comedy cusack is excellent as a puppeteer who stumbles into a portal that leads to the head of john malkovich keener is a delight as a woman that cusack and wife diaz are both attracted to tv veterans bean and place provide good support and nobody plays john malkovich better than john malkovich his is a masterfully controlled performance that does not lapse into caricature like screenwriter kaufmans adaptation and eternal sunshine of the spotless minde this film is based on a farfetched premise but whereas those two films fall apart after promising starts the brilliance is sustained here a good deal of the credit for that goes to jonze,black_comedy
i love watching original films buton our daysits very weird to see an original movieis a very original moviethe movie always surprises with original and unexpected things and its impossible to predict itthe performances are great but my favorite ones are catherine keeners and cameron diazsdiaz is a nice woman and hereshe appears ugly and that transformation helps to her characteris a weird experience on actual moviesan original experiencei totally recommend this movie if you wanna see something fresh and newrating9,black_comedy
i had no idea what to expect when i watched the movie 1999 has a one of a kind theme and of course of all actors in the world to pick john malkovich brilliant the movie has twists turns and a surprise or two in storeit is most interesting to see how the characters develop and how ultimately everyone ends up sometimes i wonder how the actors got through some scenes with a straight face the movie manages to be darkly tongue and cheek from start to finishif you want to see a movie that is unusual funny poignant with a philosophical thought thrown in check this movie out,black_comedy
is a wonderful example of intelligent comedy it is a very unconventional and unpredictable film craig schwartz works on a floor in an office building where the distance from the floor to the ceiling is only four feet he discovers a portal hidden behind a filing cabinet that causes anyone who passes through it to live in john malkovichs brain and observe the world through his senses for fifteen minutes they are then dumped by the edge of a highway craigs wife lotte tries it when malkovich is making love to maxine a girl whom craig is crazy about and so craigs wife decides that she must really be bisexual craig and maxine charge people to use the portal but a problem arises when john malkovich also lines up for the opportunity,black_comedy
when i first saw all i could think was this isnt really just a comedy  its seems too easy to label this film as just a comedy it covers so many different areas and shows more emotions than a large majority of more highly regarded films  dont be mislead this is a very funny film but its also quite dramatic full of fascinating complexity and beautiful imagery  from craigs dialogs through his puppets the visions and feelings experianced through malkovich the in the very literal sense lowceiling workplace the absolutely priceless chase through malkovichs subconscious it all comes together with a very sad strange and appropriate ending to create a work of art  a must see to truly understand even if fully understanding may never have been intended,black_comedy
this movie is totally whacky and wonderful forget the metaphysical philosophical meanings and everything else this is one very hilarious movie the plot is quirky but what stands out are the brilliant lines great situations and absolutely outstanding actingspoilers hereinjohn malkovich is totally mindblowing when he plays craig schwartz you see john cusack and not malkovich truly brilliant catherine keener has the most attractive role and she does full justice cameron diaz in a deglamorized role shinesapart from the acting the quirky movie is radiant with brilliant humor that makes one laugh out loud the weirdness of the situations get more and more complex and are very well handled by the director spike jonze this movie has a terry gilliam feel to it without going totally overboard the plot gets quite absurd but honestly i didnt care it was a fun movie weird yes but wonderfula quirky 8,black_comedy
i read the review that imdb gave and when analyzed the movie is fairly good  however how many people analyze a movie to that extent while viewing it  i enjoy a movie that has a comfortable mix of interesting storyline and entertainment value  granted is imaginative in exploring the idea of being someone else but i did not think the movie was entertaining at all  the particular brand of humor was somewhat ridiculous i thought that the cinamatography could have enhanced the ideas being conveyed  i also thought the movie would have been more interesting if one or two ideas were fully developed rather than several aspects being merely glanced over  i would not be suprised if this film was an experiment  if it was i would be curious to see what becomes of it,black_comedy
this is a totally unique film which breaks new ground and has a perhaps two good laughs but if your enjoyment requires your willing suspension of disbelief you may not enjoy this film  i went with a friend because the reviews were favorable and we were both quite disappointed  i kept expecting something good but it never came and i found it tedious  a film does not have to be great to be enjoyable but i felt this was a total waste of money,black_comedy
i have heard non stop about how awesome is basically i think thats why i had stayed clear of this film i thought it might not live up to my expectations due to the fact that i absolutely love the actor john malkovich i was afraid that this film might damage his name for me but i decided to give this film a chance when my mom said that she liked it very much and to give it a shot so i watched it with an open mind lol get it eh well i got a pleasant surprise when i watched this film it was fantastic it was the perfect cast amazing settings incredible camera work and not to mention a very unique story that was so interesting to watchcraig and lotte schwartz are a ratty looking married couple craig is a struggling puppeteer and lotte takes care of sick animals at their house she asks craig to get a real job he ends up getting one in this building as a filer where the ceiling is less than 6 feet tall everyone acts very strange but he meets a beautiful young woman maxine a player of her league he becomes obsessed with her well everyone seems to naturally love her craig one day finds a portal that leads to the mind of actor john malkovich and exploits it with maxine but lotte becomes more obsessed with the portal and discovers a deeper side with it followed by a group of peoplei would have to agree that it is one of those movies you just have to see its so strange but works on so many levels the cast was just beyond perfect i mean you can barely recognize some of them especially cameron diaz what a role breaker her and john cusack were absolutely great in the scene where they are fighting over maxine and who truly loves her more well the whole cast was great and i would highly recommend this film its great entertainment910,black_comedy
there are always people wishing they could be their idols and this is the ultimate portrayal of when that wish comes true for whatever purpose from oscar nominated director spike jonze craig schwartz john cusack is the struggling puppeteer with no job so after seeing an advert for needed quick fingers he goes to start work at lestercorp on floor 7 as a filing clerk as he continues working there he not only becomes attracted to coworker maxine lund oscar and golden globe nominated catherine keener but he finds a secret portal into the head of actor john malkovich himself for 15 minutes after telling maxine and petloving wife lotte schwartz bafta and golden globe nominated cameron diaz about the experience and trying it themselves they decide to offer the experience to the public for 200 a time after experiences inside maljovich where he meets and makes love to maxine lotte is having thoughts about her sexual gender and identity ie shes basically turned gay and maxine can respond with her only through malkovich after a while though craig has had enough of being a loser and has found a way to control malkovich and stay inside him it is with this talent he makes malkovich the victim for his wanted puppetry career and he marries maxine also starring orson bean as dr lester charlie sheen brad pitt and sean penn the ending does slow a tiny bit with the daughter but the film is ultimately a fantasy treat the highlight of the film is malkovich going through his own portal and he is in a restaurant surrounded by other malkovichs it was nominated the oscar for best writing screenplay written directly for the screen for charlie kaufman it won the bafta for best original screenplay and it was nominated for best editing and it was nominated the golden globe for best motion picture  comedymusical and best screenplay cameron diaz was number 65 john malkovich number 59 and john cusack number 48 on the 100 greatest movie stars and malkovich was number 53 and diaz number 26 on the 100 greatest sex symbols outstanding,black_comedy
is simply one of the most stunningly original and inventive movies ever made to think it is the movie debut of a video clip director spike jonze and an unknown tv sitcom writer charlie kaufman makes it an even more impressive achievement if this brilliant movie is any indication of their talents the two are headed straight for the top of the heap what i particularly admire about this movie is that in manages to pile strange situation on top of strange situation without being gimmicky and the way it manages to discuss weighty topics like creativity and identity without losing sight of the fact that it is a comedy and an extremely funny one at that the three leads john cusack high fidelity catherine keener johnny suede and cameron diaz theres something about mary are all wonderful especially the unexpected casting of the latter two actresses the first of many many surprises in this hugely enjoyable and mindblowing trip and what can you say about john malkovich himself the man is now a certifiable legend for even agreeing to participate in this movie on top of that his performance is wonderful and multilayered the rest of the supporting cast led by veteran orson bean innerspace are all excellent and there are several amusing cameos especially a scene stealing turn from charlie sheen which more than makes up for his many hammy performances over the years i cannot praise this movie highly enough it is a surreal hilarious thought provoking genrebusting classic and one of the very best movies made in the last twenty years yes its simply that good,black_comedy
thank you charlie kaufman for writing and spike jonze for directing this quirky fantasy a disgruntled puppeteerjohn cusackfinds a real job as a file clerk on the 7 12 floor of an office building behind a file cabinet he discovers a secret passage that is a portal to the brain of movie star john malkovich cusack confides in a  bawdy coworker catherine keener who he has a crush on they both decide to go into a small business of selling trips into the head of malkovichthe humor is witty and dark the story line is so obtuse it is near hypnotic the viewer is compelled to watch again a little bit closercusack is wonderful and proving to be a very versatile actor cameron diaz plays cusacks wife who contemplates a sex change and falls in love with keener also in this fast paced fantasy are mary kay place orson bean charlie sheen and guess whojohn malkovich,black_comedy
one of the great things about storytelling is that you are absolutely free there are no limits to the imagination whatever you can think of  in your story it can happen unfortunately filmmakers do not very often make use of this unlimited freedom most of the movies made these days are just variations of stories that have been told in other movies beforeevery now and then however someone has the courage to be original all it takes is one good idea that idea does not necessarily have to make great sense  on the contrary a really weird idea can be the foundation for a really interesting film like what would happen if all the birds suddenly started to attack people as in the birds or how would it be if you had to live through the same day over and over again as in groundhog dayin that basic idea is imagine you would find a gate which leads directly into the brain of john malkovich very original very weird very promisingunfortunately this time the result falls short of what might have been the opportunity sure was there with a setup like this the outcome might have been a hillarious comedy an exciting thriller perhaps even a spooky horrormovie it became neither somehow the author could not come up with enough good ideas to give the film the tempo it needed all the twists and turns that could and should have been in the story are amissone more reason why this film fails are its characters i am not talking about the actors here  they are good but the people they play are not to really get into a movie like this audiences need a focal point a character they can identify with  the hero if you like who is that supposed to be here in the beginning it might have been craig schwartz  professionally unsuccessful a little bit naive and with some kind of stubborn pride all in all quite likable  even in spite of his clumsy attempts to cheat on his wife with maxine  who is a bitch if there ever was one as the movie goes on however craig becomes increasingly mean he does things that we feel we would not do and thus loses us on the way and lost we are now for there is no other potential hero to turn to maxine is still the bitch and lotte is simply to whacky for anybody to identify with her what happened was before the supposedly dramatic climax of the story i had ceased to care for whom there would be a happy ending and for whom there would not and that is a perfect foundation for being bored 510,black_comedy
this movie was really bad it makes no sense and is bad it is quite disturbing and should not be watched why would anyone want to watch something about a woman being attracted to another woman when she is in the form of a mans body thats sick the whole idea of the movie could have been made into something interesting but was far from this i found this movie in the comedy section and it was not funny at all it just weirded me out this movie was just absolutely and pitifully awful cameron diaz did act well i guess and she was looking pretty terrible all the odd sexual references in the movie made it quite nasty i do not recommend this movie to anyone on this planet,black_comedy
obviously this film has a clever premise and a number of cute gimmicks along the way like floor 7  12 but ultimately they seem to exist just to be inyourface quirky and zany they arent developed in a thoughtprovoking way theyre simply gimmicks draped around a flimsy and trite social commentaryall the same this film could at least have been entertaining if it didnt expect you to endure its grating and drab characters ok i get it the characters are all unlikable so that the movie can show how flawed our society is thats a real cute concept but the characters need to at least be interesting to be worthwhile and satisfying in keeping with the films premise the characters are uniformly flat and gimmickythe film attempts heavily to be sophisticated and dark and thoughtful in terms of sex but its annoyingly adolescent and immature the sexual tone seems like it was guided by kids who thought talking dirty about private parts was the coolest most grownup thing in the world the film fails to accept sex as a natural part of life instead reinforcing the common american view that the most simple and boring sexuality makes someone a special snowflake since the film takes itself so seriously on this subject it wears thin fastall in all only watch this film if you feel like you can ignore its obnoxious style and can glean some small entertainment value from the silly gimmicks dont watch it expecting anything legitimately thought provoking deep or meaningful,black_comedy
based on all the good reviews i rented this movie and i must say it was terrible i guess i am just in a minority group conservative with morals ethics and a far greater taste than what this movie provided sure it was creative but far from a work of genius and it certainly was not that funny if you are another individual like whats becoming the average american with little or no sense of decency perhaps you will enjoy this dull movie,black_comedy
since every human being is constantly tethered to their bodies and their perception of the world through that body the curiosity of what life is like from another persons perspective is intrinsic to human nature so what if the person whose body you could inhabit was critically acclaimed actor john malkovich and what if the portal to his mind was in an office with a low ceiling because it was in between two floors of a skyscraper answers both of these questions and many more with a surprising amount of insight and depthcraig schwartz is a struggling puppeteer performing on the streets of new york to an audience who doesnt want him he has a wife lotte but they are clearly somewhat distant from each other and she is often at work or trying to convince him to get a job finally he obliges when money runs low and he ends up filing cabinets at the odd floor 7 12 its telling that his boss thinks that he has a speech impediment because his assistant has trouble hearing and often misinterprets his words the only window into how he is perceived by others is filtered through the imperfect perceptions of those around him in this office he sees maxine lund and slowly becomes desperate for her even acting out a romantic encounter with her with his puppets while proclaiming its the chance to feel what someone else feels that draws him to puppeteering soon after he stumbles upon a window into a mans brain and while john malkovich may have seemed like a random choice by screenwriter charlie kaufman i dont think its an accident that the man they begin to live through is an actor himself constantly trying to immerse himself in many different roles and different lives as craig and lotte soon find out completely changing their role and appearance in life helps them to further discover who they are and what they want by discovering that her true self is not the gender or appearance or age that their assigned lotte realizes she feels more comfortable as a man of course they do begin to exploit this sudden discovery as most human beings would do maxine does it for control and craig does it for maxines adoration but it is only a matter of time until malkovich himself finds this portalmalkovich inevitably entering this portal himself couldve been handled in a plethora of ways but how it is handled is brilliant funny thought provoking and it deepens the themes of the film it shows how our mind ultimately compares everyone around us to ourselves because it is all that we have to compare to and it also shows how many different versions of oneself exist within ones own mind each revealing themselves at different times and this isnt even the last big surprise of the movie the climax exists entirely in malkovichs subconscious although even through all of the films heady ideas and absurdism it remains a very fundamentally human film as craig gets a hold of controlling malkovich they toy with the idea that ones position in life and preexisting image often dictates their success but the surprisingly tragic ending reveals that what is at the core of who craig is regardless of the body he inhabits is who he desires and this is ultimately what dictates his actions and it isnt hard to see that this desire is what dictates every other character as well especially when the person one desires is just out of reach,black_comedy
weve all heard andy warhols most famous quote but this is the first and likely to be the only movie that will ever made that liberalizes that notion is a brilliant whacky kafkaesqe comedy of inventive writing this is the kind of movie where you either hate every second or you smile and let yourself go with it i am part of the latter this is the craziest and most original comedy i have ever seenas the movie opens a street puppeteer named craig john cusack has just lost his job his puppets are works of macabre performance art and now he has found himself looking for work because of todays wintry job climatehe goes to work as a file clerk in a building on floor 7 which has low ceilings that the employees have to stoop down to work under any other comedy would have been happy with this joke but kaufmans script is just getting warmed upone day craig discovers a small door behind the file cabinet he opens it and his whisked away through a portal into the brain of actor john malkovich he hears what malkovich hears sees what he sees and goes where he goes fifteen minutes later he drops out of the sky by the side of the new jersey turnpikehe informs his coworker maxine catherine keener of his journey and after she tries out the portal she hatches a plan she persuades him to start charging admission so that people can get their fifteen minutes eventually john malkovich himself discovers their little operation and goes to find out what is going on at one point he enters his own portal and  lets just say that freud could have written volumes on that experienceanother development craigs wife lotte cameron diaz tries out malkovichs portal while malkovich is on a date with maxine when lotte and maxine find out what has happened they begin having a pseudolesbian affair that only works when one takes over malkovichs brainnow what i have described of the plot is only about 15 the movie still has a long way to go a new development comes along and then another and another and another charlie kaufman has a screenplay here that would have been enough for ten movies when it was over i realized that as much material as he has in his wonderful script that this movie could have gone on for another hourthe cast contains some of my favorite actors john cusack that wonderfully intelligent actor here plays a puppeteer who finds the ultimate puppet show catherine keener is perfection at playing cold manipulative and nasty women here and in last years your friends  neighbors cameron diaz is a beautiful actress and gives up something for this film that most actresses never could her vanity she plays lotte behind mop of unruly brown hair and no makeup her character is sweet but becomes obsessed maxine and malkovichis the kind of movie that i long for after all the junk this is a drink in the oasis in a desert full of mostly entertainment dreck it must have taken a small miracle for director spike jonze to get this kind of content on screen i have heard some people call it weird confusing nonsense mostly those are the people who go in for deadend garbage like the waterboy is funny and creative and gives the audience something to talk about afterwards those who can appreciate it know its greatness just like the portal this wonderful film is beyond description to those who havent seen it you just have to see for yourself,black_comedy
john malkovich plays himself in a funny and confusing tale of being a body that can be accessed via portal movie is a fantasy cum science fiction of portal to actor john malkovichthe story has so many strange elements throughout that are hilarious as well as intriguing john cusack plays an unsuccessful yet passionate puppeteer lives with his wife played by cameron diazthe story takes a strange turn when he finds a job at the lesters the rest is worth watchingi felt there were so many elements that could have been used to give a more meaningful end to the story but were left untouchedstill a really good story worth your time,black_comedy
is yet another kaufman gem initially the premise sounded a bit like a onenote joke and i was reluctant little did i know that the film has various different story lines interwoven from one simple premise in fact not many screenwriters could be able to successfully blend in all of these different plots but kaufman does so brilliantlyim still amazed by the turns the film makes last night i watched adaptation and it was also a great film with equally creative and ambitious ideas this one though feels much different its comedy is blended in sort of funnier and also sadder moments the fate of one of the leads in the end is also pretty sad in itself all of the different ideas of identity from kaufman have never been better exploredoverall another great film from jonze and kaufman based on the four films i have seen kaufman write eternal sunshine synecdoche new york adaptation and this its true that no one writes outrageous and creative yet also investing comedydramas like him,black_comedy
its not that there are no great writers its that there are no great readers any more  gore vidal written by charlie kaufman and directed by spike jonze revolves around a lowly puppeteer played by john cusack who discovers a portal which allows him to enter hollywood actor john malkovich once in the portal cusack is not only able to see and feel what malkovich experiences throughout the film malkovich is portrayed as being weak willed and uncertain but control all of malkovichs bodily actions completely submitting the actor to the puppeteers willso what we have here is a more meta version of hitchcocks vertigo or pixars ratatouille cusack the artistdirector who uses malkovich to kickstart his own career going while the various characters who enter the portal see only memories of malkovichs personal history a kind of deliberately onedimensional and comical psychoanalysis session in which the freudian and selfdefining moments from malkovichs past are revisited malkovich frets about have seen his parents having sex as a child cusack is uninterested in the being or self of malkovich or even being malkovich hes concerned only about controlling the actorsignificantly when cusack possesses malkovich the real malkovich disappears entirely and is defined instead by cusacks memories and actions recall nietzsches writings in beyond good and evil identity is merely based on a kind of hierarchy of dominant and less dominant power drives our individuality based on how we prioritise our prevailing drives and how we respond to intrinsic and extrinsic motivations in other words malkovich loses being when possessed while the bumbling cusack gains being when actualising his own drives through malkovich ie the artists ego often needs a surrogatelike kaufmans synecdoche new york adaptation and confessions of a dangerous mind all the artists in this film thus long not only for control only creative types are able to control malkovich for extended periods but for immortality through art in this regard one character called dr lester wishes to achieve immortality by literally possessing host bodies whilst cusack wishes to use malkovich to gain fame and validationlate in the film cusacks damaged ego is contrasted to malkovichs who when he enters the portal and therefore himself sees only a kind of selfcentred world populated by hordes of malkovich characters this scene literalizes the egos of the actor and writerdirector everyones the centre of their own universe but the puppeteerdirectors egoworld collapses without a puppet for the audience to watch and the puppetactors egoworld degenerates into moviestar narcissism if he has no other personalitiespuppets to embody or possess in other words the ego is always a projectionthe film can be read as a comment on contemporary celebrity culture everyone in the film wanting to enter and be a celebrity soaking up their 15 minutes of fame but kaufman goes to lengths to stress how banal malkovichs celebrity life really is modern media and peepshow reality tv removing the mystery and glamour of the famousthe film seems more interested though in being a selfconscious and more specific analogy for the relationship between spectator and screen using pov shots both the audience and various characters who pay to enter the portal literally embody malkovich one rather obese customer even gives his weight as a reason for wanting to become john malkovich the point being that cinema allows moviegoers to identify with someone or something they are not successful handsome famous etcfor the audience this identification is a passive one but for cusack passivity is not enough he wants control in this way like adaptation synecdoche new york and confessions of a dangerous mind functions as a sort of art manifesto because of his creativity and because he is an artist cusack is able to surpass the brevity of the malkovich experience and actually accomplish something the point artists influence actions and choices the masses are passive voyeurs consumers or eavesdroppers in the artists brainspace and the tragedy of the artist is not only that he must often transgress moral boundaries but that he is dead without an audience or mediumat its best though the film touches upon mans obsession with validation whether it be the customers who enter the portal to escape their own lives or cusack and malkovich wishing to be the centre of their own stage everyone in this film has a narcissistic desire to be the centre of the universe this horror is mirrored to several characters who all desire to return to a previous stage in their development in which they do not seek validation from others and in which they are unaware of their own gender what lacan called the division between i and me in this regard two characters called maxine and lotte embrace their homosexuality and cusack becomes trapped in a baby in each case these characters have stopped living through the eyes of others a form of ego death similar to that experienced by philip seymour hoffman at the end of synecdoche new york8510  too quirky and surreal to generate profundity or drama the films zaniness allows it to touch upon more ideas than similar puppet movies like vertigo and ratatouille but this very zaniness dilutes any long lasting impactworth two viewings makes a good companion piece to lynchs inland empire,black_comedy
portrays the unsettling allegories which are rarely dabbled in  exploitation and identity the protagonsit craig shwartz settles for a filing job as he struggles to pursue a career in pupeteering automatically this connotes a representation of reality in the aspect that it doesnt matter how good one is at something in this society which is reflected at the end when he becomes successful  only as john malkovich neither craig or his wife loitti seem to realise or simply not care that maxine only loves them as jm and conclusively gets abit dark into i think it is amazing how john malkovich is at the centre of all the characters destinies  despite him not taking the main role the film really does leave you thinking,black_comedy
first lets just say this was so much better than i expected  and i already had high hopes john cusack john malkovich what more could you want now i would have been hesitant if i had known cameron diaz was going to show up but she was a minor part of the film and handled herself well one or two more good films and i might finally forgive her for vanilla skythe story is very absurd a young puppeteer finds a door in his office that goes in side john malkovichs mind thats strange enough but it gets so much wackier from there but i wont ruin it for you you have malkovich in the primary role who is by far one of the greatest actors in history and you have cusack as the secondary role who is also a great actor  one might even say more versatile his costume in this film makes him almost unrecognizable as cusackwhat more can i say without giving this away first the film is really deep existential but also very funny when cusack first tells his coworker about the portal she asked who is john malkovich which i find hilarious  both because i wondered the same thing when the film first came out and also because it begins a long string of selfdeprecating malkovich momentsthe only other thing you need to know if youre not already sold this film is a charlie kaufman creation whos kaufman the guy who made adaptation and if you havent seen that you really ought to id even say it a better film than this classic there you go i just suggested a double feature get your rump in gear and visit the video store,black_comedy
only the best writers can come up with such a dazzlingly unbelievable storyline yet engross the audience so thoroughly that they hang off every word from every contrapuntal character and each bizarre concept i believe kaufmann has achieved this glorified omnipotence with i wonder does he intend to play with the audiences mind or did he simply say to himself i will think of some ridiculously comical situations and attempt to weave a story with some veracity behind each phrase whichever way the cookie crumbled he gave us this masterpiece also i would like to praise cameron diaz for undertaking such a drastic overhaul of her career we are all too familiar with the barbra steisands of hollywood ie image is gospel and i will behave like child because my money and attention somehow retarded any emotional or mental maturity that may once have occurred diaz has startled me into thinking that some tall blonde gorgeous actresses actually dont mind looking less than their best if it means playing an interesting multidimensional character the dialogue is exquisite my advice listen to every word that is said from the boss with crystal clear pronounciation and a sorryaboutmyspeechimpediment complex to charlie sheens disturbing bald appearance where he drools over lesbian witches whilst malkovich desperately attempts to express his fear the conversation that arises somehow from these weirdly colourful characters is almost shakespeare in its rhythm and beauty finally the scene in the restaurant has to my knowledge never been attempted before in a mainstream picture and for that i applaud it i cant reveal too much but the malkovich overload is all too apparent see it for yourself and enjoy the most original movie out in ages,black_comedy
bjm for some reason is rated on imdb  in the top 100 films of all time this is an almost unimaginable turn of events for a hastily scrawled cartoon of a film an interesting but small premise sketchy character development rough never beautiful filming   the end result should be a footnote at the bottom of 1999  not one of the all time greats,black_comedy
i watched this movie and i agreed with many of the reviews people posted it was lever unique new and at least a little funny it did have its moments but im sorry to say that all these things do not always make for good watching i mean just cause it is original doesnt make it good i laughed some but i just found the whole mess really weird and had trouble liking any of the characters it was alright but i wouldnt watch it again 3 out of 10,black_comedy
this has been a great year for alternate realities at the movies films like the matrix sixth sense blair witch project thirteenth floor and run lola run have all in different ways played with the line that separates past from present reality from simulation and truth from fiction can be added to this list of innovative films that a recent issue of entertainment weekly described as the first films of the 21st centurythere is little in this film that is formula john cusack plays a gifted puppeteer who aspires to be one of the worlds great puppeteers unfortunately there are not a lot of job openings for puppeteers so he is reduced to street theater where he is clearly underappreciated an almost unrecognizable cameron diaz plays cusacks wife a pet lover who is just a little quirky when cusack decides to take a job as a file clerk on floor 75 of an office building life becomes even weirder cusack discovers an opening behind a file cabinet a little door that leads into a tunnel like the characters in cs lewiss the lion the witch and the wardrobe or alice through the looking glass cusack jumps in and finds himself in an alternative universe instead of narnia or wonderland cusack finds himself on a 15minute ride inside actor john malkovich played quite capably by    john malkovichcusack joins forces with a coworker to create a business for 200 people can spend 15 minutes inside of john malkovichs head seeing the world through his eyes since this is even better than real world or a webcam show people come in droves eventually malkovich himself discovers whats going on and jumps the line to go inside of his own mind this leads to what has to be one of the more unique scenes in the history of film the story takes on an even more interesting twist when cusack finds a unique way to fulfill his lifelong dream of being the worlds greatest puppeteerthis is one weird filmand ive left out some of the weird this is also one of the most creative films i have seen and the film raises interesting questions about consciousness identity love and meaning there are great performances here by cusack diaz malkovich and catherine keener cusacks coworker and eventual love interest the real star of the show however is the story itself firsttime screenwriter charlie kaufman has crafted an interesting and innovative story firsttime director spike jonze handles the material extremely well this is clearly not a film for all tastes and the language and sexual scenes may well offend this is however something that is very rare in hollywoodinnovative creative and thought provoking watch for this film during the oscar nominations if this doesnt get nominated for screenplayat leasti will hang up my trophy,black_comedy
i have seen this movie multiple times i thought i had already reviewed it but as i looked back over my reviews on imdb realized i had been silent on my favorite dark comedy a failure i must amend immediatelywhat made me think of this movie today is catherine keener in get out the 2017 gem created by jordan peele which i had to praise after watching it last night on hbo i think it was a really smart choice for peele to cast her i will never forget her since seeing her in what i love about this movie is well everythingno let me take away 1 star and give it 9 because as i recall the ending did get a little too drawn out and overstayed its welcome the ending did remind me of a lesson learned at ucla screenwriting taught by professor richard walter about beginnings and endings and when to exit the scene and examples of sometimes when directors cant get off the stage but it wasnt too bad the ending it didnt spoil the whole movie it just went on beyond what felt like a good endingas for the 9 stars i give iteverything from the moment the story begins drew me into this deliciously weird world and it was as funny as it was mesmerizing every time i mention this movie to someone i feel the urge to watch it again and every time i have watched it again i fall in love with its weirdness and humor all over again so it should definitely be on the watch list of anyone who has not seen it who likes dark comedy i cant think of a better dark comedy than,black_comedy
where to start the coolest conceptual story to come around in decades kaufman is a sheer genius tying in philosophical quandaries with dark caustic humor and fanatical elements like no other spike jonze brings this script to life formulating a perfect storm of imagery and powerful performances it speaks to everyone as you will identify with at least one of these tortured characters casting cameron and cusack as these frumpy fops is brilliant as well and they both give the best performances of their careers playing against type in a magnificent display of grotesque beauty and who would have thought the ending could be so poignant tragic and satisfying at the same time what a damn roller coaster ride of imagination also nice nod to surrealist alfred jarry with the half a floor joke he famously made his apartment like this for some baffling reason love this film,black_comedy
how did charlie kaufman manage to think up something like this theres a lot of things going on that can be turned into half a dozen films but it has been brilliantly woven into this crazy ride the 3 lead actors are phenomenal and malkovich is even greater for accepting such a role,black_comedy
this movie is magnificent its tough to describe because its one of the most off the wall batst crazy plots ever conceived imaginative and inventive film making at its best a must see to believe that it was actually made you never know where this movie is headed which makes it super enjoyable,black_comedy
is a brilliant movie spike jonz and charlie kaufman did an amazing job directing and writing the movie flawlessly weaves multiple bizarre stories and characters together the movie was very well shot from the opening scene with the puppets all the way through to the end mixing reality with fantasy it has a wonderful cast with great performances by john cusack cameron diaz catherine keener orson bean and john malkovich is one of the many movies that got me interested in movies it is one of the best movies from the 1990s it is a complex movie that is fun to watch every time i see it i catch something new it is absolutely brilliant any body really interested in movies should see it,black_comedy
john cusack stars in a film that follows a puppeteer in a film directed by spike jonze entitled cameron diaz and catherine keener costars together with john malkovich and charlie sheen playing as themselves craig schwartz works as a puppeteer and is having tons of financial problemshe get a temp job as a file clerk on the seventhanahalf floor of a large office buildingbut one dayhe surprises himself that he finds a small door that leads him towards the head of guess who  john malkovich himself  while rummaging behind a cabinetthen he and his beautiful coworker maxine tries to make money out of it by charging admission for the spending 15 minutes inside the head of wellknown actorthings become uncomfortable for john malkovich himself as a lot strange things start to happen to him as different people spend time inside his head and cannot do anything to stop it then craigs wifelotte takes a trip inside malkovich himself and things start to get funny and strange things happen for all characters involved  craigmaxinelotte and the malkovich himselfthis was definitely an inventive film that one would surely find funny and entertainingalsoit was nice to see john malkovich tag along in a film that try to make fun of himit was nice to see how people take advantage of getting inside his head to learn more about him especially the things that the wellknown actor would do privatelyadded to thatwe are also treated to a new premise that made a film worthy of multiple viewings especially when it deals with a lot of funny themes that involved alteregossexual fantasiesvirtual realitiesvanity and many others that one would surely find it new and refreshing for someone wanting something new in their moviegoing experiencethe performances were definitely great from cusackdiazkeener who got an oscar nomination and malkovich himselfscreenwriter charles kaufman and director spike jonze definitely did a wonderful job of writing and directing respectively as the movie was wellmade as it remained focused and centered despite of its various themes that will definitely add lots of enjoyment to the viewer,black_comedy
spike jonze has in his hands a complicated script by charlie kaufman and its amazing how it transforms this complex script different silly and seemingly almost infilmvel in a complete audio visual work in narrative terms but somehow the work not me handle it is not the fault of the film all spike jonzen movies are great but none captivates me emotionally and this is no different as i said before it seems something silly which turns into a beautiful romance outside the traditional  but i can not untie that premise boba with the rest of the film maybe spike should use more sound resource since this film is missing a soundtrack at times although the sound mixing is impeccable photography the characters and even the extras in the scene are emblematic some characters have only one speaks in history but realize their great personalities and amazing scenery remember the schwartz couples home or surrealistic company that craig john cusack works the film also has a philosophy to present we are stuck in our bodies our lives are miserable we are ambition of slaves yes remember fight club which we would not give to be someone else even for fifteen minutes our lives are so bad that i do not know or spike will know because it only displays the question and does not delve into it its a good movie do not expect nothing amazing but i believe faithfully that depending on the person her anger find your favorite movie because he has something to say but it depends on the person understand and sympathize with himsorry for my english translator google,black_comedy
surprised me  i did not expect much of this movie  the more it made me laugh  and amused me much the script is good and original  the cast is excellent john kusack is very well  john malkovich is excellent  as well as other major actors such as charlie sheen  even appearing for a short time  the moments are funny  the direction of spike jonze is very good the picture is good  the film has good camera games the moments that appeared on the point of view the malkovich are good  the scene that john malkovich enters the portal and see him in a restaurant that has several john malkovich is very funny i gave a lot of laughter in this part  is a great film with funny moments  great performances and a good direction of spike jonze  note 87,black_comedy
is a terrific movie with a very well developed storyline and a really talented cast there is nothing else like it as is anything from charlie kaufman and spike jonze two individual film makers who are not one bit afraid to take risks which they did here to a significant degree it certainly does not sound good on paper two coworkers discover a portal to the mind of john malkovich in their office building but everything in it really works the story will warp your mind in a way that you will enjoy the only problem i had was that they glossed over dr lester who is beautifully portrayed by orson bean his story a very complicated one could have been developed much more the film has a surprisingly sweet and inspiring message to be true to yourself the person you want to be to pursue your dreams and not to hold back on what you would like to achieve you may find it strange how a story such as that could have such a powerful methapor to it you will have to see for yourself the cast is outstanding and are well able to handle the films weirdness john cusack and cameron diaz deliver one of the best performances of their careers as two damaged soles with an obsession with catherine keener a mean manipulative deceiving woman you can not help but love however malkovich is without a doubt the star of the show portraying a very exaggerated version of himself i would assume being forced to change personalities and identities throughout for certain reasons doing it all to full effect weird whimsical and somewhat inspiring is a movie that will leave you feeling a range of different emotions all which you will enjoy a must watch comedy drama when a puppeteer is forced to take a job in an office building he soon discovers a portal that takes him in to the mind of actor john malkovich best performance john malkovich,black_comedy
a film like this has some great ideas in its head what if you could go inside the head of one of the most underrated actors of all time john malkovich thats a question that youve probably never thought of but wish you did after seeing one of the best films of the 20th century easily a movie that could only be written by the one and only genius madman himself charlie kaufman and directed by the other genius madman spike jonze the genius of this film is the subtext surrounding itself is a film about identity longing the complexities of the mind and what we really want out of lifethe film starts with craig schwartz played by john cusack using a marionette puppet destroying his property around him the puppet looks strikingly like schwartz and in that one scene we see the complexities and possessiveness of cusacks character in just one scene is about said puppeteer craig schwartz who gets work at office 7  discovers a doorway in his office that when entering inside of it allows you to be in the mind of john malkovich but as the film progresses schwartz is finding out more and more about the people he loves as he delves in more into the psyche of malkovich the wonderfully original script by charlie kaufman who has written some of my favorite movies adaptation anomalisa and my personal favorite of his synecdoche new york its funny how i have just found the time to watch what has now just become in the matter of a few hours one of my favorite films of all time its mix of drama and comedy makes this a standout of any film that will ever exist is a triumph to the world in saying that crazy can make the world a better more brighter place for filmspike jonze has impressed me ever since i saw his marvelous romance film her and by seeing his directorial debut it shows me that jonze has never lost that spark of creativity or brilliance that was shown to the world in 1999 its shocking to realize that this was his first feature film and has topped many peoples favorite films of all time i can see a bit of what kaufman and jonze would bring to the world in the next decade in a way jonze and kaufman is making us the audience craig schwartz by letting us infer on what they want to show us and what the characters in their movie are trying to express but cant with the possessiveness of schwartz its truly fantastic that a movie can let us feel what we want to feel rather than how we feel i havent gotten into this as much but is one of the funniest dark comedies i have ever seen in my life it has a great mesh of it and isnt always hilariously goofy or always grimly dark but a good mixture of the two that will never be replicated much like the performances in this that will never be replicatedthis movie is filled with career bests for everyone in the cast john cusack catherine keener cameron diaz and the one and only john malkovich give mind boggling prowess to their roles as mentioned previously cusack can easily bring a complexity to a character that you should hate but you dont because of his empatheticness and possessiveness he bends the ways of how the audience sees him to try to paint a false idol of what he wants to be but isnt sadly he explores the part in us humans that we can never escape from not getting what we think we deserve schwartz goes crazy mad when he spills his heart and guts for a woman that couldnt care less about him diaz has the best performance of her career in this film she brings the side of humanity of trying to find out who we are and are we actually being honest to ourselves or are we just trying to change ourselves so that we can be the best for other and not whats best for us but the standout of this is the titular actorcharacter himself john malkovich malkovich brings the side of humanity that is quite fascinating to me are our thoughts actually our thought are we thinking what we want to think or is an outside source just making us think the things they want us to think im honestly surprised that i have written this much about only 3 characters in this film but isnt that what shows the beauty of this film that i can dissect it and think about it at this level of depth and still be mesmerized by it and want to go back and rewatch it as soon as possible i think sois the greatest gift the 1990s ever left on us and shows that we dont need to follow the same norms that the hollywood industry has put on us as audience members and we can see actual bright ideas that dont follow the normalcy of what we put up with throughout the year a grandeur of the surreal and a favorite of mine that i want to rewatch over and over and over is that times a thousand,black_comedy
we all once in a lifetime had this though of being someone else is an elaboration of our thought with a conclusion the movie must be appreciated for its weird characters performed really well by the actors from the very start the clues are given for the upcoming things in the movie but the writer just plays with our psychology script has some really riveting twists like that one scene when john malkovich enters his own mind humor is dark and meaningful director has focused on small details when lotte goes towards maxine to kill her and her head hurts the door ceiling i found no loose strings in the movie its designed in a way to hold you on your seat from the very start to the end the movie carries a dark feel to it very artistic and everything is placed perfectly to grab your attentionreally appreciable work by the whole crew,black_comedy
unemployed puppeteer craig schwartz john cusack and animal lover lotte schwartz cameron diaz are in a loveless marriage craig gets a job on the low ceiling 7 floor of a manhattan office building he falls for alluring fellow worker maxine lund catherine keener who doesnt return the feelings he finds a doorway in his office that leads into the mind of john malkovich after 15 minutes the person is ejected into a ditch on the new jersey turnpike maxine decides to sell tickets at 200 a pop lotte is completely changed by the experience and thinks shes a transsexual craigs boss dr lester is obsessed with malkovichthis is one of the strangest and most compelling ideas ever put on the screen written by charlie kaufman and directed by spike jonze it is exciting that everything and everyone is a little off in this movie cameron diaz is ugly john cusack is disheveled catherine keener is a sex goddess the whole movie is off its axis and so much the better for it its so weird that its a lot of fun,black_comedy
the story that lays in this film is un believable clever and original for a comedy as the film progresses you begin to laugh at the absurdity of the story alone the acting all done well and writing is done well making this film like able all around the film is rather strange but is still very enjoyablemy favorite thing about this film is just the absurdity and ridiculousness of the situations this film shows all around this film is definitely worth watching if your the right person i can almost guarantee enjoyment for people who endure and watch the whole film thanks for reading my review,black_comedy
exciting intriguing  incredibly original is a seamless fusion of fantasy in a real world environment and presents an interesting theory of a portal that leads into the body of a different person the screenplay is freshly imagined  smartly scripted by charlie kaufman and is stunningly presented on the screen by director spike jonze the point of view shots are nicely carried out editing never lets the excitement run out for the entire runtime  the performances by everyone is pretty much up to the markjohn cusack stars as craig schwartz an unsuccessful puppeteer who discovers the portal into john malkovichs mind cameron diaz is lotte shwartz craigs petobsessed wife  finally we have katherine keener as maxine craigs coworker who decides to exploit the portal in order to make some bucks john malkovich plays himself in this film  his performance among the cast was the bravest  most impressive the film also includes cameos from charlie sheen sean penn  others playing a fictional version of themselveson an overall scale spike jonzes directional debut feature is one of those films which you mustnt miss out you have to really see it to believe how amazing its concept is  how much sense its themes make in the real world atmosphere the less you know about it the better will be the experience so stop reading more about this film  just go watch it if you still havent in a sentence is one of the finest films of the 90s,black_comedy
isnt easy to categorise lets just say that the story of a frustrated and bitter puppeteer who discovers a way to get inside the mind of one of americas greatest actors isnt standard hollywood fare john malkovich deserves a lot of credit for allowing this bizarre film to be made somehow it wouldnt have been the same if writer charlie kaufman had called it being michael douglas or being jim carrey looking at the negative comments for this film it seems that even the arthouse crowd are split down the middle too pretentious to be mainstream yet too gonzo to be a cult classic is the cinematic equivalent of marmiteyoull either love this film or youll hate it i recommend that you find out one way or the other  you can always switch off after 30 minutes if you dontpersonally i love marmite,black_comedy
one of the strangest films ive ever seen the second half is pretty different from the first half and probably less original and daring  but still pretty odd i enjoyed it overall you should at least watch it once no matter what your preferences  theres really nothing quite like it,black_comedy
not that i actually hated it so much as i was annoyed by it annoyed by the whiny selfabsorbed characters particularly the uberwoodyallenish puppeteer played by john cusack annoyed by the idea of a seventhandahalf floor of an office building where all the employees must stoop hohoho annoyed by the secretary who mishears everything thats said to her hardeharhar and finally annoyed by that damned portal into john malcovichs head where the hell did this idea spring from and why choose the new jersey turnpike for characters to land in after theyve been ejected from  from  where do they fly from anywayokay okay there were numerous moments in this film that were very funny and the idea of john malcovich playing a parody of himself  or rather a parody of what the public thinks hes like  is great as it happens mr malcovich handled his part beautifully but it only served to remind me how much more this film would have lived up to its title if it had been about say a struggling thespian or fan who is so enamored of john malcovich that he tries to emulate him or stalk him or something like that at least thats what i thought the film was gonna be about till i read the reviewsim sorry folks i love innovations and its always refreshing to see even an unsuccessful attempt to break away from the usual crop of actionsmackshionhorny teenager malarky believe me ill take this puppy any day over the bachelor but innovative should not necessarily be confused with great an orange with a peanut butter filling may be innovative but that doesnt mean its gonna taste good,black_comedy
was beyond my expectationsi mean this is perhaps the most original idea lately captured on screenit is the plane story of an unemployed pupeteerjohn cusackwho gets a job at a wired company at the 7 12th floorit has a completely screed upyet funny storyof the building and accidently discovers the portal to john malkovichs headthing is taht his wifeunrecogniseble cameron diazfeels attracted as well to the ideacompletely blowing up his plansmalkovich is top even as himselfso far only con air blacks his careersorryfansand even funnier as watched on the insidealso notable directing of previously quite unnoted spike jonzerent this one if you havent yet andeven betterget it for your own collectionit is worth itfreud surely would,black_comedy
this movie is too precious to waste time just talking about it see it now the script is so wellwritten the actors so on par to the bizarre material and the whole situation so strange and quirky that this film is a mustsee love cameron diaz with the fritzy hair catherine keener looks really good,black_comedy
first let me state that i just finished watching this movie an hour ago i cant get it out of my mind  a definate 10 out of 10  this movie is so gripping the almost 2hours will pass quickly too quickly  the mind of the writer of this must be very warped indeed  if this isnt a cult classic i dont know what is  if you loved a clockwork orange and oh lucky man and that genre youll love this  having john m be the main person in this film is ingenious he is not as a previous writer stated as popular as brad pitt or madonna and thats the point  i will forever remember this movie whenever i see john m   why it didnt win every category at the oscars is beyond me  trust me what do you have to lose 3 at blockbuster  oh and get the dvd version  the bizarre extras are kind of interesting to watch when winding down after the movie,black_comedy
a real masterpiece bjm is an unapologetically bizarre well crafted well written and wellacted film  a true original and an instant classic for every wouldbe screenwriter out there who feels heshe must write the next giant asteroid flick or sequel to wild wild west just to sell a script this movie should provide the adequate glimmer of hope,black_comedy
when i saw this film with my big brother i had never heard of it so i didnt expect it to be all that good but what a surprise when we got inside of malkovich mind or whatever you want to call it i got very confused end spoilers hmmmwhats going on i thought from there on it just got better and betterthe most original script that has ever been made a very stunning funny brilliant and original movie either you hate or love it i love it i advise you to go see it some dayenjoy,black_comedy
although brilliantly funny and wonderfully acted by the title character actorcharacter  we have no clue if he actually is himself anymore this film deceives in being bitingly cynical  are we honestly so obsessed with not being ourselves that we could stoop to stealing the identities of others  for real  maybe so but should film be about dictating what life is or what life could bei honestly have no pity nor sympathy for any of the characters in this film perhaps not even malkovich himself as he falls for the manipulative witch played by keener  it is a puppet show of dark humour and we the unsuspecting children are engaged to watch itthe ending truly is the final straw being absolutely disgusting lets face it though  it is popular to tell society that we are all perverted at heart in some form or another  most of us already know this fact  its when we get past our repression and let ourselves be who we are that we might feel like we are truly worth our own lives and therefore in my opinion worth celluloidmalkovich just wallows in its shadowy tunnel,black_comedy
it certainly is one of the most unique and original movies youll have seen in a while i just feel it cant be termed a great movie because it appeals far more to the intellect than your emotions and i think a great movie has to have some emotional resonance  whether it stirs sympathyempathy or loathing all the characters in bjm are essentially dislikable or pitiable but their characterizationmotivation is based in a fantastic situation and so far removed from lifelike experience that you end up emotionally detached from the goings onwhat it has going for it unlike anything youve seen  a trippily absurd fantasy of a movie a great comic performance by malkovich himself and a strong and sassy turn by keener some amazing cinematography especially where the puppetry is involved fun cameos some truly hilarious moments  the falling bodies cracked me up every time and i loved the street puppeteering sequence wthe lusting nunmonkwhat it has against it cusacks role though competently acted just doesnt fill the center of the movie granted that has much to do with his character a puppeteer whose puppets are his outward expression of soul  so in a way its a testament to his good acting it just feels a little weightless the closest empty character i can think of is chauncey gardner in being there must be that being thing a fine filmnovel jerzy kosinzski about a shutin simpleton whose only exposure to the outside world is via television who is unwittingly thrust onto the streets and into the public eye  where his idiocy is mistaken for profundityas noted by other people the whole concept of being thrust into someone elses consciousness could be made more interesting than the psychosexual drama that serves for the main plot in the second half of bjmwell  thats my movie criticism for the day well worth renting  just doesnt quite live up to its potential and is more intellectually stimulating than involving,black_comedy
was quite an interesting ride through most of the movie i kept thinking wow this would be great if we were stoned or tripping but since i dont do that anymore i had to settle on my own boggled mind i saw this movie without knowing who the actors or director were or anything about it for that matter i was pleasantly surprised when i figured out that it was john cusak and cameron diaz wow they can get out of their cookiecutter roles and they did diaz as the pathetic lotte schwartz was both sad and amusing cusak as her husband craig was disturbing at times but also so sincere about how he feels about life catherine keener who plays love interest maxine is somewhat charming and always downright rude she was great now malkovich himself hmm i have to wonder if there were any other actors on the title before him his appearance throughout the movie was just so blah except for one certain scene in which he branches out if you know what i mean youve seen the movie i was very disappointed in his performance so maybe its a good thing hes a stage actor as wellmy final words definitely rent it but dont own it,black_comedy
this is definitely one of the more bizarre films ive seen  you probably know the story by now  a bland unimportant man with a passion for puppets craig finds himself lusting for a selfish cynical female coworkermaxine who pays him no mind until he finds something she thinks can be of use to her  a door which takes people into the mind of john malkovich  for fifteen minutes  someone can see hear smell taste and most importantly feel everything the actor experiences  problems arise  however  when craigs wife lotte becomes addicted to the experience  and the way it allows her to actualize her desire to have the same woman her husband wants even if only whilethe atmosphere is bleak  but befitting what ends up being such a bleak tale  the movie presents the surreal and supernatural as existing rather matter of factly and characters never seem to question the existence or plausibility of the portal  but this isnt a movie trying to pass itself off as reality anyway  it becomes a somewhat intense character study early on  and the director chose wisely i think not to waste time trying to validate the existence of the door into malkovichs head  the characters all give excellent and convincing portrayals of highly dysfunctional people john malkovich  while he spends very little time onscreen as himself  is fascinating to watch being controlled and manipulated by others  in the end  he is someone nobody ultimately is concerned with  everyone simply wants to take what it is they desire for themselves through the use of him regardless of his own feelings  and in that way  everyone displays a strange obliviousness tomy biggest complaint with the film is that rather than making some obvious philosophical statements on the nature of being and consciousness which could have easily been put forth by the existence of the portal  it instead seems to concentrate on merely relating the tale of the most bizarre love triangle youll ever witness  that it does very well and in an engaging manner  but the possibilities of the portal still seem strangely unexplored in the end  perhaps  however  whatever message is trying to be conveyed is wrapped up in the story itself  i am certain the movie is full of symbolic imagery and actions that will take some time to digest if you want to experience an almost surreal movie that will stick with you for some time this is probably a good pick  if you dont like movies where the implausible and fantastic is accepted without question  however  its probably not going to appeal to you,black_comedy
i watched this movie on dvd last night unusual story and very good acting throughout but a little slow  especially the first half of the movie the problem is that not a great deal happens in the movie  and some of the interesting strands arent developed like the way that everyone kisses malkovichs ass  but the shallowness of people is skimmed over but definitely original good performances from the main players  and that woman catherine keener is an absolute stunner there are better scifi movies the matrix and better insights into human nature american beauty i gave it 610,black_comedy
the only competition to american beauty for best film of 1999 is acutely hilarious visually stimulating and mind altering the cast without exception is in top form led by an exceptional performance by the title character  john cusac harkens back to the acting brilliance shown in grosse point blank and cameron diaz shows that she is not just attractivethe story builds upon a roux of disparate concepts  the 7 floor that is only 6 feet tall a delicious transcendent sexual triumvirate and the hub of the story is on one of the most enigmatic actors of our generation  what results is a satisfying gumbo of distinctive storytelling sculpted imagery some of the puppet shots jonze came up with were amazing and attention grabbing quirks keep an eye out for cameosprovides a cinematic experience unlike anything you have seen before  regardless if you love it or hate it it will leave a lasting impression on you,black_comedy
in the first couple of minutes of the movie you get the feeling that a very interesting and thought challenging movie is ahead however as the movie progresses the plot becomes rather boring the concept of being into someone elses mind is handled in such a manner that you do not get the chance of associating any more ideas or feelings into this idea a general theme in the movie is perhaps that the characters show no empathy against each other this makes the movie dry and limits the scope of the movie,black_comedy
i noticed this movie is ranked as the 20th best of all time by imdb users  while i agree this movie is entertainingvery original and offbeat  it is clearly not the 20th best movie of all time  i might consider it for top 20 for 1999 but that might be a stretch since there are so many other worthy contenders  not that the movie is bad i think it is very good and worth seeing on video cameron diaz and john malkovich himself are standouts in this film,black_comedy
was one of my worst cinematic experiences ever fortunately i walked out before the end of this disaster and i actually stormed out of the theatre pretentious asinine stultifyingly stupid pointless execrable insufferable garbage mindnumbingly awful incompetent inept ludicrous third worst film of all time behind rent and vanilla sky words cannot express how much of an outrage this film is those responsible for this dreck would not know what creativity is if it hit them in the head with a hydrogen bomb the negative should be burned and the ashes scattered to madagascar i hated this movie,black_comedy
since my video store did not have much choice when it comes to video cassettes i randomly selected john malkovich as the synopsis seemed interestinghowever it seems as if the movie was shot by some amateur video photographer bad camera work and add to it the absence of natural or sufficient light i do not understand the directors obsession of dark or less lighting could not even see properly the faces of all the charactersthe idea is nice but wish director had made it a fantasy movie like terminator or matrix with proper character development rather than creating such absurd piece of junk,black_comedy
watching this movie is about as painful as dentistry without anesthesia  watching paint dry would have been more excitingthey should have made this picture being bill clinton now that would have been exciting  but then i guess it would have been an x rated picturethis movie vacpacked hardwayno,black_comedy
slow boring nonsensical and selfindulgent this must be amongst the most overrated films of all time at the end of the day this is a film which it is fashionable to rate well and pretend that it meant something to you  and hence you must yourself be as clever as this film desperately tries to be unfortunately it fails isnt clever it is contrived,black_comedy
this films has a big wow factor to it but very little other than that movie starts with a promising premise but starts to drag after first 40 minutes and is just plain boring towards the end characters have no actual depth and so does the script i must say that i was delighted by the reptile attitude of catherine keener maxine and john malkovichs subtle selfaware acting its an original and strange movie but thats not enough to make it either a good movie nor a pleasant experience 610,black_comedy
really there wasnt one character in this movie that i even cared the least bit about   cameron diaz as a monkeyloving hippie in the worst wig since bill murray in kingpin   kusack as a totally unlovable greaseball with a bad pony tail it doesnt get worse than this for characters but the characters are brilliant compared to the plot  i wont get into details i can only warn you away from this piece of garbagethis movie was horrible start to finish i feel ive wasted an hour and a half of my life,black_comedy
i havent seen more pointless movieit really suckedi dont want to be bearish but it was really a pointless movieat first i it wasnt so horrible but when the movie ended i was thinking why did i started to watch this kind of a movieand later when i discovered that this movie is in the top250 i got a real shock,black_comedy
i bought yes bought not rented but bought this movie without having seen it  that my friends is faith  i had read about the premise and thought it was brilliant truly innovative  finally i thought a movie that might wash the bitter taste of lost in space the motion picture out of my mouth  i believed that it might even move me to forget the mistake i made in seeing hollow man though in my defense i was dragged to the theater by two very wellmeaning friends  i must say i was also influenced by the wonderful cast i mean there was not one actor in that movie whom i despised a rarity in my case  so what you may be thinking was my problemlet me tell youas far as a wonderful idea goes didnt let me down the film holds an idea born of sheer brilliance and lets face it probably more than a little cannabis  it is an idea rife with promise and potential  with it this work couldve gone so many wonderful places and couldve expanded minds like no movie since spaceballs has even attempted the makers of this film could have done all of these things and more with such a fresh idea such an imaginative idea but did they  no  that is why i am so bitter  i wasted 1650  the makers of this film instead took an idea that was so original so untouched so imaginative and turned it into the most trite sex farce i have ever seen  they turned it into a movie all about sex  i felt insulted  sex is the least thoughtprovoking theme that a movie could ever have and it is almost blasphemous when applied to a film with such artistic potential  i mean who doesnt think about sex at least once every minute  yeah real unique  to be honest the latter part of the movie seemed like a cop out  it seemed to me that the script writer wasnt sure of what to do with such a gem of an idea  here in his usually capable hands was something that no one had done before so he panicked and ruined it with an almost narcoleptic ignorance of what he was doing  like dorothy he had no idea what a pair of ruby slippers could do so he let them go to waste  at least dorothy realized the power of those damn shoes by the end of her romp through oz and decided to do something about it  makes no such aboutface however  in fact it falls flat on its face  still like every movie it has its moments and i definitely think its worth viewing just dont make the same mistake i did  for the love of all thats good and decent borrow it from somewhere310 for giving it the old college try,black_comedy
left me cold  actually it turned me off  the basic premise was interesting but it was all downhill from there  this movie contains significant scenes of violence against a woman  this violence is gratuitous it doesnt really stem from preceding scenes and the perpetrator is not portrayed as particularly reprehensible  apparently a lot of people liked this film  im not sure what movie they saw  can it be the same one i saw,black_comedy
this is a film which tries too hard to be a lot of things it succeeds at being none of them it tries to be clever it tries to be original it tries to be wittyanyway people will tell you that this film is original they are wrong things which appear to be original are in fact stolen from science fiction stories which have a much higher level of quality this seems to be a recurring theme in a lot of writer charlie kaufmans work yet he continues to be praised for it the only good thing that can be said for him is that he chooses excellent things to steal fromyes the main character is a puppeteer we get it the metaphor is really unnecessary we also get the andy warhol reference hahaha too clevernaming a poultric bird after a senator also thats brilliant add to that the fact that the senator in question is slightly birdlike and you have something which is unparalleled in modern cinema and something which is completely unnecessary an effort to be political lets hope notive heard people say that the film is good because of spike jonzes direction of the mirror scene for lack of a better term one scene of questionable quality does not make a good film i dont care how hard it was to do i just want it to be goodoh and cameron diaz trying to show how good of an actress she is by wearing a wig and possibly a false nose that seems to be one of the hallmarks of good acting these days body accoutrements though they add nothing to the portrayal they are lauded even to the point of oscar nomination and victoryoverall a very overrated film youd do well to steer clear of even if it wasnt overrated itd still be a bad film1 out of 10,black_comedy
wood allen meets monty python but the clash think that they are submitting a ghestalt entry for the nobel prize  pretentiousi have read plenty and despite several viewings of the film nothing has made the theme of this art obvious  what are these kids doing  and they actually got paid to mentally masturbate for an edited 113 minutes  other than some ethereal sensation that left too many reviewers mesmerized long enough to stumble back to their keyboards and write an effusive but consensually hazy it must be good because it seems like art review what else happened hereif you want to see all that film could be but wont become heres your ticket  if you want to learn something and really be entertained  not confused  there is a lot to choose from on the shelf,black_comedy
it was this site that put me up to rent this movie and for the first time i felt the need to ask my money back i didnt even see the end of it after 34 i got so bored with this movie that i wanted to burn the dvd or throw it from my balcony 3 stories high the plot never seemed to catch me and even knowing that this movie was pure fiction i found the story youre walking in the head of jm with jm by walking through a door behind a desk can it get more stupid  so hard to get that i just gave updont rent it dont waste your time save money,black_comedy
if there is one movie out in the world there that i do not recomend to people it would be the new rollerball movie but this would be second this movie contains lesbians pointlessly dumb idea poorly written and some parts are just plain retarded this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen if your looking for a movie that is off the wall bizarre do not choose this one cause its just stupid see something like blast from the past or wrongfully accused again is stress how how horrible this film was,black_comedy
i cannot understand why a movie with such a poor plot so badly filmed with long sequences dimly lit for example and acting that is everything else than outstanding can reach the top 250 this movie is grossly overrated,black_comedy
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen  not only is the premise completely stupid it didnt make me laugh even once  the storyline is stupid the acting is terrible and the movie just plain stinks dont even bother to waste the 2 hours of your life on this movie,black_comedy
doesnt anybody have anything better to do i cant believe anybody would find this arbitrary nonsense groundbreaking or innovative and certainly not strange im guessing that anyone who thought this movie was an inventive incisive or unusual has never seen eraserhead or the silent nosferatu much less read naked lunch or even seen the movie how bout we make a movie about um some kid who lives inside a giant peach oh yeah thats been done too,black_comedy
im gonna be very very frank i hated this movie i dont get all the praise towards it its an original film but one of those which the difference doesnt bring good results i didnt like it the slighest bit in fact there wasnt a single moment i liked it was incredibly dull and dumblots of things dont fit well if anything fits well in it at all for example what was that goofyness of the ceilings being so lowheight in that job forcing its workers to duck the whole time another thing i noticed on that job was that the woman who interviewed craig misunderstood every little thing he said and even claimed a few times that she didnt know what he was talking about it also doesnt make sense that dr lester kept insisting that he talked poorly that people had a hard time to understand what he says  when he speaks perfectly well plus he said he was 105 years old i dont believe it yes he was an old man but he couldnt possibly be that old not even close to thatnone of the characters were minimally captivating or interesting craig himself seemed to become something like a nutcase through the films course besides that ridiculous and alarming obsession of people in wanting to be john malkovich including lotte craigs wife who even wanted to go as far as becoming a transsexual give me a break  even if she didnt get to do iteverything in this joke of a movie was insane and ridiculous the fact that the other woman manipulates malkovich to make love with craig and lotte when they were inside him and the way he was controlled by craig the fact that in the end malkovich gets rid of all that mess only to be possessed again by numerous people who completely dominate him  and the portal is never destroyed malkovich even goes inside himself to one point and what he sees is hundreds of malkovichs theyre everywhere constantly hearing john malkovichs name bored me to death i got pretty tired of listening to his name all the time plus why is this movie about and not someone more interesting for example like george clooney the entire scenario looks awful and so lifeless as for cameron diaz if i didnt already know she was in the film i probably wouldnt recognize her it was quite a shock to see the beautiful cameron diaz the gorgeous and super sexy tina carlyle from the mask  a movie that i like very much like this really ugly the combination of that awful freezy hair with that awful color and those more than horrible clothes all of this made her look almost like a witch the character she portrayed wasnt likable either plus her performance was very poor just like everyone else in the filmeveryone in the film thinks that malkovich was in a jewel thief movie as far as i know he was never in a jewel thief movie before this ironically he was in johnny english 2003 which is a jewel thief movie  and his character pascal sauvage was involved in it until his neckin conclusion this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen,black_comedy
i could not even watch it all the way through it had no draw pulling me toward a resolution i grant that maybe there are two kinds of people in the world those that like this movie and those that do not there must be some deep rooted psychological difference between the two groups maybe i am just happy being myself but of all the people in the world to want to be john malkovitch that alone just showed me the movie had nothing in it for me,black_comedy
im surprised so many viewers enjoyed this filmit goes so far out on a limb that it threatens to be potentially alienating to an audience this is a ticklish joyride full of sheer ridiculousness yet it all comes together smoothly managing to be completely free of any cinematic inhibitions john cusack plays a puppeteer with beautiful puppets who gets an office job in a very odd building on the 7 12 floor where the term low overhead is literal the movie does get convoluted in its final stretch but it never fails to be engaging and wildly clever the acting by cusack cameron diaz catherine keener and john malkovich is superb fanciful original and amusing ideas come from left and right credit writer charles kaufman with a screenplay that is never pretentious or cynical and director spike jones for never losing sight of his characters all mad romantics  from ,black_comedy
everyone seems to love this film because its so unique and bizarre and sure it has its fun and interesting parts but as a hole its almost disgusting the characters are so stupid and selfish and unsympathetic that i got ped offanother thing i didnt like is that films like this usually have something to say about life or relationships or whatever but doesnt tell us anything at all its just a pointless film that lives on its unique ideas  which im sure the film makers were in love with but for me it wasnt enough far from itthis film also made me wonder if john malkovich is as unsympathetic in real life as he was in the film since he played himselfalso the ending is too bizarre and just sooo bad you wont lose any night sleep if you skip this one,black_comedy
i cant believe anyone liked this movie  really  it was like naked gun on a dumber levelok not really  but almostim going to pretty much bash everything i remember about this sad sad movie so if you havent seen it dontkeep reading that isanyways i thought the movie was pathetic  yes the acting was good great in fact  yes i was impressed with the visual aspects  yes the directing was just peachy  but the movie was hardly funny  the only time i laughed out loud during the entire movie was the first time our hero was excreted onto the side of the nj turnpike  it was so random and unexpected that i had to laugh  and that was it  i thought the writing was very bad the character motivations were soawkward  like our hero the puppeteer what was he in for  the girl artistic integrity what  and everything just turned to doo for him in the end  what a bummer  but the real enigma of this flop of a movie was whatshername  oh yes and dont worry i suck with names in real life too   so the black haired woman whats she in for  everything she does contradicts everything else  i dont understand how she could possible fall in love with puppetmans wife it is so completely unrealistic it goes beyond funny  it just sets me in the theatre with a confused look  her motivation is unrealistic and lame it seems like the writer got stoned one night and said hey what if she like falls in love with the other chick and they raise their daughterand stuff  like the nileists really bad spelling nieuhlists in the big lebowsky  ie the writer got stoned one night and said lets have some nileistsand a ferret  go figure but what steams me the most is the complete lack of structure in the movie it starts out like its going to be a long drawn out internal struggle to maintain artistic integrity in puppeteering and then bam john malkovich and everything starts speeding up  what took 15 minutes to say in the first half takes 25 minutes to say at the endall in all i left the theatre with a bad taste in my mouthoh yeahthe 7 12th floor  yawn,black_comedy
this film is well made great performances great idea and an exceptional film for a firsttime directorthe best thing about the movie is that john malkovich agreed to play a parody of himself i admire that he was willing to do this film after a few years of refusing to star in itthe idea john cusacks character finds a portal that leads to john malkovichs mind this idea is funny and had potentialthe performances by the actors are good john cusack did a great job as craig schwartz cameron diaz did a great job as craigs wife lotte john malkovich did a great job as john malkovichhowever the weakness of the film is that the story gets weaker as it goes on at the beginning of the film craig is presented sympathetically he is a struggling puppeteer but by the end of the film i stopped caring about him his obsession with his coworker maxine and locking his wife in a cage played a part in this the same is for lotte at the star of the film she is portrayed as a caring person especially towards her numerous pets but by the end of the film i stopped caring her obsession with craigs coworker maxine played a part in thisspoilers start i think the film went a little overboard with the craziness at first john cusack discovers the portal behind a filing cabinet the portal is a small door hidden under a panel later in the film it is revealed a group of old people were going to enter the portal at midnight on john malkovichs 44th birthday the problem is the portal being a small door was surrealist enough and did not require an addition plot elementi think the films idea was strong enough not to have additional plot lines like immortality through changing bodies suppose the vessel they are using dies in an accident or gets a disease  not a secure method and why midnight on the 44th birthday the human brain stops developing in the 20s  why not then theyll be in that vessel far longer the wifes romance with the lady at craigs workplace in john malkovichs body craig controlling malkovichs boy for 8 months makes him very unlikable as well as caging his wife also when he leaves malkovichs body he looks like he would have had he stayed only 15 minutes  considering he was controlling malkovich after some practice he is a puppeteer does that mean he was separate he must have been as malkovich was aware that he wasnt in control also he would have been reported missing the rules of the portal are not clearly explained  it allows you to enter john malkovichs mind for 15 minutes to somehow allowing people to stay longer if they really want to how silly is that considering those who enter the portal are willing to pay 200 for the experience maxine was unlikable in the first place and the fact shes manipulative and gets a happy ending bothered mespoilers over despite my problems i would still recommend at least a watch to make up your mind its still a good film although i probably wont watch it again considering that its hugely popular and praised obviously some people enjoy it,black_comedy
i have seen the movie yesterday it is entertaining with imagination lots of twists and characters lesbianism lustrous love lusts etcthe story line was confused with scifi black comedy and psychological intermingling of characterization so none of them scored to their maxand is it original somehow i remembered the brainstorm that came in the late eighties brainstorm was a scifi but dwelt into the story line idea same pointofview shots and brainstorm thrilled me at the end with a philosophical touch into the nothingwhen craig explains about the john malkovich portal to keener i thought there the story would go into the deeper dive but it just afloated with men and women living for centuries would still constantly linger for sex as like that of teenagersthe john malkovichturnedtoppuppeteer part documentary was a nice piece and the induction part about the casting john cusack and cameron diaz were unrecognizable transformations into perfect roles of the storyat the beginning of the story there was a dialog by craig consciousness is a curse i expected similar ones throughout the movie but none has come remember american beauty that surely is a classic and magnolia but misses here,black_comedy
1st watched 4122003  7 out of 10dirspike jonze offthewall sometimes funny sometimes thoughtprovoking trip into how far people will go for eternity  yes the title is but its more about  being reborn into another person and therefore living forever  cusack plays a puppeteer who cant get work in this profession until he finds a portal in his new jobs office that leads him into the title characters mind  this soon becomes a profitable experience for him and his partner and lustlove interest and they are selling tickets for 200 a pop to enter in  there is much more to this movie including cusacks attempt to hold on to his wife and later his girlfriend  his wife played by cameron diaz and her trip and discovery into being a lesbian thru malkovichs mind and much much more  what makes this movie good is its complexity although its direction is confusing  it starts out as a comedy but ends as an eerie supernatural thriller  i believe it would have been a better movie if they would have picked one or the other   despite this the movie is definetly a unique experience to be seen,black_comedy
in spike jonzes overrated but fine movie john cusack is craig schwartz a struggling puppeteer he lives with his wife lotte cameron diaz who is an animal lover but we never find out her job craig needs a job so he gets a job on the 7 floor of an office building soon he discovers a portal into the head of actor john malkovich john malkovich weirdness ensuescusack is unrecognizable and so is diaz but not catherine keener who plays maxine someone else who works on the 7 floor i found that the quasiromantic quality between cusack and keener was onesided keeners acting was rather stiff i was disappointed cusack was quite good if a little forced at times it seems like he was forced into doing this movie diaz was okay but nothing remarkable as i said before keeners acting was flat malkovich actually was good i was pleasantly surprisedthe story is unusually mellow going for a lot of the movie without music it would make more sense to bring out the mood of the piece i also felt like jonze underplayed the fantasy element sure i liked the 7 floor and the portal but if they had used more special effects imagine a day where someone would say that it would have been more believable not that this concept is one that happens every day the ending which includes craigs boss dr lester orson bean seemed too out there and out of the blue many times we were expected to think oh of course because they rarely explained anything i did find it amusing at first but after awhile it got annoyingat the beginning there were lots of laughs but they soon became sporadic and smaller of course this isnt a film where everyone is telling oneliners but if they had as ive said before put in special effects maybe humorous ones it would have made the movie more enjoyable it was very entertaining and imaginative though only jonze could think of something this twisted i had no idea where this roller coaster was going to stop or if id just be stuck in the looptheloop for 105 minutesto me it looks like jonze is a puppet fan glamorizing puppets all throughout the movie i didnt like the first ending where everything slows down but the last one i did like a lot that doesnt make any sense right well where you think the conclusion is i didnt like but the denouement i enjoyed theres not much more i can say about this flawed but enjoyable comedymy rating 610rated r for language and sexuality,black_comedy
listening to a drunks account of his mishaps out on the town the previous night is a lot more fun than actually watching him do itshould have been a 1020 minute short a skit on snl or something along those lines it has an interesting premise but not much else theres a lot of cool individual stuff not seen in other movies but it doesnt add up to anything really least of all a decent movie to learn that spike jonze was and presumably still is a music video director didnt surprise me at all he knows how to work a camera set up shots and make stylish goodlooking stuff but in a feature film one needs a lot more than that i love the beastie boys beck and daft punk videos as much as the next guy but there jonze has the advantage of being able to simply throw a lot of cool unusual things on screen without having to tie it up into anything remotely coherent he tried the same approach here with the result being pretty weak in my opinion to hear this movie be lauded with compliments such as daring thought provoking and visionary is very laughter inducing i must admit what thoughts other than get me outta this theatre did this mess provoke id really like to knowto summarize is original unusual and visually good but more importantly it is also messy annoying and not deep enough in story and characters to support a 2 hour movie around this one single idea,black_comedy
i dont think there are many spoilers here but read at your own risk if you have even seen a trailer or skimmed a review you know what is about the irony of is that once the characters begin actually the film seems to stop being interestingbeing an admirer of malkovich as an actor and being that i had skimmed so many glowing reviews of the film it was on many top ten lists and was a 4 star film in many circles i really wanted to like this movie alot before i ever saw it i also wanted to find a way to justify liking the film more than i did once it was over but the truth is i was disappointedthe set up of an out of work puppeteer who only seems to come alive when commandeering one of his marionettes eventually happening upon a indefinable job for a vague company on the 7 12 floor was odd but in an interesting kind of way then the portal into malkovichs mind is unearthed this seemed like a promising development but it really falls flat in my opinionin no time people are lining up to be in malkovichs head but it is not clear why no one who enters the vehicle of malkovichs being does anything remotely interesting with their opportunity not even john cusacks puppeteer the puppeteer really does nothing inspired at all given the ultimate marionette a living breathing human being as his plaything as character upon character used malkovich to try to bed each other i began wishing for mr malkovich to realize what was going on and react to it but even this action has no payoff malkovichs realization results in a strangely amusing scene in which the actor enters the portal himself but ultimately he never really tries to fight for possession of his self if he does we dont see most of it which is a shame because that would have been interesting to watch begins with an ingenious original distortion ofreality and offers the promise of a strong second half about the importance of self in the end however it boils down to many unlikeable characters attempting to achieve their selfish uninteresting goals in life both current and eternalthrough another person who happens to be john malkovich but really could have been anyone for the purposes of the filmthe film never ceases being unique but it ceases being entertaining 6 out of 10,black_comedy
the only funny bit was when john malcovitch went inside his own head and everyone was saying malcovitch otherwise i found that movie very dull and boring the storyline was original but i found the movie twisted and weird i would not recommend it to anyone,black_comedy
i never had the desire to see this movie but i saw it because some of my friends rented it the premise of this movie is there is a door that leads to the inside of john malchovichs head but like the other poster said its all about a guy who wants to have sex the movie has maybe 2 slighty humorous parts and scince its a comedy that makes it a travesty they never explain anything in the movie where the door came from why its there or why it does what it does people say its genius because its original and differnt people that does not make a good movie the movie was original and differnt but nonsenseical and unfunny avoid this movie at all costs unless you have a sophisticated sense of humor,black_comedy
there were several amusing moments in this movie but the overall feeling i got from this film was how contrived it was  the premise itself was original at first but after cusack diaz and keener kept landing on the side of the new jersey turnpike over and over again it got pretty silly cusack and especially diaz surprise played their roles well  keener has been good in other pictures but she basically played a one note character here and didnt impress me much  the various gimmicks such as the 7 12 floor the portal the really dumb gag with mary kay place mishearing everyone were really nothing to rate this as some kind of film masterpiece john malkovich was selfdeprecating and he really lifted this picture when he arrived on the scene  his unintended conversion to a new profession and the way it was presented was the best part of the movie  it was a case though of the writer and director trying to be way too clever and the enduring value of this movie will not last very long,black_comedy
was a clever somewhat sophisticated film that kept me interested it is most decidedly quite offbeat a salvadore dali meets monty python kinda movie i didnt find it particularly hilarious but humorous and very well acted i didnt even recognize cameron diaz in the role of lotte and was surprised as i could be that it was her john malkovich himself completely stole the show he was absolutely charming and brilliant i found it a fun movie but would not recommend it to everyone if you like a far out concept that toys with the absurd this is a good movie for you,black_comedy
this film really revels in the weird and somehow turns out a decent product its not my favorite film or anything but its such a crazy concept that somehow is pretty good and hard to look away john cusack and cameron diaz really nailed it i think my favorite part of the movies is cusacks complete apathy towards his life like the fact that they live with all these random animals and diaz will like ask him about one and he wont know their names he lives with a chimp and has no idea its name thats crazy theres random other little things like that that make it an enjoyable experience this is now the second time ive watched it and both times many years down the road i came up with a similar conclusion about it for a movie about a portal into someone elses body it is much better than expected,black_comedy
a conceptual and clever movie which i thoroughly enjoyed the plot is about this mundane couple  the wife lotte has pet chimps and lizards and craig works as a failed puppeteer because he can be other characters then he found a job in a filing company gets attracted to maxine and discovered a secret door that he can go down and immediately see the world through an acclaimed actor john malkovich for 15 minutes before being spit out onto the side of the road and they start to profit of this discovery with tons of people paying to experience being jm 1 the idea that it is so much more comfortable and confident being someone else maybe because it is for a mere 15minute as a passive viewer the excitement of living another persons life the experience without the responsibility a small piece of escapism somehow i can relate to that in the identity of an aspie the more you play it the more it becomes a part of your existence and comfort i find this an interesting concept that if we can adopt different personas to our advantages of course in the film only craig and lotte manipulated jm and im assuming the rest of the queue were just passive observers in his body2 there was a scene where john malkovich himself went into the tunnel and became john malkovich and everywhere he looked were different versions of jm doing different things and he was frightened and ran to me this is perhaps the fear of facing up to our own different personas and not knowing what to do and running from ourselves its a poignant scene to reveal the discomfort in being ourselves vs the thrill of being another character3 maxine was always and ultimately only attracted to jms body when lotte is in it the idea that it will always be the core and soul of the person one is attracted to craig invaded his body fucked and married maxine and had a successful puppeteer career using the fame of jmhe was afraid to leave jms body because then who is he in the end he did maxine revealed to lotte that she was pregnant by her  sex while she was in jms body and they raised a jm daughter together4 the group of old people continue to use the vessel of the malkovich line in the daughter to continue living and not diei take this to mean that everyone of us is a sum of other people in us5 i like that the title uses the actors real name john malkovich as he is playing himself and it is a successful film vs his character craig who is always trying to be someone else through his puppeting efforts or living jms life and it was not a good ending,black_comedy
i give my nine points for originality and the quality of production though not the likeability of the characters john cusack and cameron diaz play craig and lotte schwartz a married couple that are going through the motions and dont seem to realize it cameron diaz is made up to be so dowdy looking that she is initially not even recognizable they live in a basement apartment crowded with animals lotte is an animal lover who works at a pet shop craig is a puppeteer who cannot find work in his chosen field and even gets beat up on the street for staging what one beefy dad thinks is a sacrilegious puppet showat the suggestion of his wife craig goes looking for a regular job and due to his fast hands he gets a job as a file clerk at lestercorp there he meets maxine a pretty but sociopathic young woman who fortunately for society seems to have no violent impulses because if she did believe me she would follow them craig falls for her lotte falls for her and they both make a play for her simultaneously when she comes over for dinner one night she rejects them bothmaxine made it clear from the beginning she considered craig a pathetic loser but she needs him to exploit something that craig discovered  a door that leads to a portal in which anybody who enters gets to become john malkovich for fifteen minutes at the end of the fifteen minutes the person is spit out on the side of the road at the entry to the new jersey turnpike as a team they reopen lestercorp at night and charge people 200 dollars apiece to become john malkovich neither of them knows what this portal is doing there behind a file cabinet and why it leads to malkovich but they initially dont care past its monetary valueit is part drama part comedy and even part horror and completely weird and what the portal is doing there is all wrapped up in dr lester owner of lestercorp who is the only likeable character in the film and even he has more than a bit of a dr frankensteingod complexalso featuring mary kay place as the object of dr lesters lust who has convinced him he has a terrible speech impediment  he does not john malkovich as himself and charlie sheen as himself and malkovichs friend it is great seeing charlie sheen when he was still healthyvery highly recommended but the plot is so weird you just have to let go of your reason and go with it,black_comedy
funny interesting original very weird and different but most importantly with these kinds of movies it made sense 2 viewings,black_comedy
one of the greatest  fine story the ultimate orignal screenplay one of the craziest movie i have ever seenrecommend for everyone to watch this masterpiece,black_comedy
being john malcovitch is in summary a film about love minds and puppets charlie kaufman has proven once again and this time mor than ever that in order for a script to work it has to be an honest one a script written by a person and a piece of art that illustrates that persons thoughts and emotions i am amazed by the fact that with every movie he makes he shows a side of himself a piece of his heart his films are him and he is his films as for this workit is a detailed raw and in a good way dizzing illustration of what it means to be to exist to be trapped in a body your body to want to need to ache to crave for something and because of your misery to get it you become another to be pleased boom i mean every singe moment i think about his films a new thing pops upso now i am going to tell you my view on this film anyone who just wans a brief review you can skip the next paragraph and head to the othersas i see it the film revolves around the idea of puppets yes puppets it sounds rediculous right well a puupet can mean a lot when we handle a puupet we become anotherwe live another life we control our a life and seize it the way we want to we feel grand and free being another gives us joy because another means another life with new an interesting things to live we are bored of our failure and sadness and we all seek that other how many times have you imagined how life would be if you had more money or a better house or a more pretty face or fame how many times have played theater alone and rehearse what you are going to say to sb or your future life how often have your expectations of a happy ending to your day proved you wrong and puupets mean even more everyone can be a puppet a person can control a person and at the same time be controlled by another person and it goes on forever we are never really free are we even in the film industry the cast is the puppets the director pulls the stings and he might be controlled by the writer or the production company and it goes onso in short i loved this film because this film is its creator it is his view his idea on love pain relationships desires lonelyness never feels like a selling product or a popcorny blockbuser made to make money and make people laugh we get to grasp our inescapable lonelyness and the fact that we are all the same suffering being that is born  lives a huge part of life in despair and constant sadness and dies its attention to detail from the maticulusly crafted puppets to the short hillarious documentaries its authentic performances malcovitch is shining in this one and its honest direction and writing make this film a gem and an insight to the great charlie kaufman if only i could be in his mindwait a min,black_comedy
i watched this film for the first time about 1015 years ago and remember very little about it except a doorway at the back of a store some annoying actors and quite a boring and unmemorable plot but for some reason i have had this film in my list of fivetosix films to watch now for a long time it sits there peering at me for some inexplicable reasonlast night i actually decided to watch it not expecting much at all the thing that struck me is the funny silly tongueincheek nature of this film which shouldnt be taken too seriously but is it a comedy not reallythe acting is immense especially catherine keener who i never liked before as an utterly sarcastic superempowered cynic john cusack and cameron diaz play the part of a wacky couple involved in a quaint marriage happily in love but weirdly going about their individual existences at the same timeand then things get interesting a portal is discovered into the brain of john malkovitch enabling visitors to become john malkovitch for 15 minutes this experience is so overwhelming and enlightening it has the effect of a new drug and once experienced all the visitor wants to do is go back through the portal and live that experience over and over again this affects relationships marriages interpersonal feelings and even sexual orientation especially between the married coupleby the end of the movie everything is completely on its head multitudes of paying customers even a clan of elderly people compete for jm hits and control over the hostwhat struck me the most about this film was how humorous and enjoyable it was in comparison to my overly serious perception of it in the past as though it was supposed to mean something in fact it means very little at all but emphasises how marriages can be fickle to the point of selfdestruction,black_comedy
never has a film been so innovative well acted bizarre and unique hats off to the director and actors for a great classic from the modern era,black_comedy
lol first i though john cusack was nicholas cage but then i realized that it was john cusack loved the colors in movie dark theme great existential questions and great performances by awesome cast this is movie for everyone and i wonder how spike jonze got idea for this film i would never think that you can make movie about being in john malkovichs head,black_comedy
the really surprising thing about this utterly original film is that its not based on a novel the premise the dialogue the tone and the switcheroo plot all appear to have come together fullyformed in this charlie kaufman screenplay rather than adapted or distilled from a long and complex existing work i got to a third in and found myself thinking i bet the novels great wonder who wrote itit took me decades to get round to watching this and i enjoyed it enormously cusack and diaz are having a blast cast against type and keenan is a femme fatale of a type weve never seen before in his intensity cusack seems to be channelling his sister joans uptightness in fact i found myself thinking who is he reminding me of here and it was ros mullins in school of rock which came out waay after this diaz has never been better her selfrealization postmalkovich experience is hilarious and compelling as is the threeway dinner date with craig and maxinein the surfeit of ideas  such as making craig an unemployed puppeteer with nimble fingers ideal for filing the history of floor 7 and a half and the transformation of malkovich from actor to puppet maestro  inevitably there are some misses the ending particularly disappoints but hey with such low overheads they pass on the savings directly to youthe films extraordinarily meta conceit that john malkovich plays john horatio malkovich and also plays craig schwartz as john horatio malkovich is at once mindbending and believable but perhaps it could have been tom cruise after all its a good performance and a brave one but apparently it all comes down to the way the syllables of malkovich sounded to kaufman and who are we to argueglad the new jersey turnpike got a shout out in a film are there any others where it features so prominently,black_comedy
charlie kauffman is a genius and is a testament to that a unique idea but the zaniness is a bit too much to overcome not the directors fault though spike jonzes filmography is defined by the offbeat and probably could be his most straightforward or accessible film but if so was the intention then he could have made this into a more box office friendly film the drab settings and production design and the bleak outlook dampened the mood the acting is good throughout and john malkovich is very good playing a scared version of himself and as mentioned at the start the idea is absolutely class,black_comedy
theres something so rare about 90s moviescameron diaz playing a homely ditzy characterjohn cusak putting on a good performanceoctavia spencer with a 10 second scenean inexplicable charlie sheen cameo where he plays the typical charlie sheen character to be fair this time he was actually playing himself and john malkovich calling him charlie as if their similar careers have made charlie sheen and john malkovich such good friendsbut this was fun spike jonze and charlie kaufman show us an early preview of their creative innovation this movie is so meta it certainly could have been released today in 2018i need more catherine keener in my life good acting meets a unique screenplay i think if its 20 minutes shorter and you cut the dr lester story line its even bettermalkovich malkovich malkovich malkovich malkovich malkovichif i could ask any screenwriter any question asking charlie kaufman why john malkovich has to be near the top of my list one of the few films i wouldnt mind a sequel to with a different person being tom cruise or being jennifer lawrence definitely gets a watch from meside note if the end of the tour is made 20 years earlier cusak could definitely play david foster wallace,black_comedy
such a unique classic bjm is the masterpiece of all bizarre quirky psychological thrillers do check it out if you havent already,black_comedy
you dont have to just watch this twisted masterpiece i have no clue how anyone came to this awesome idea but its originality itself is enough to make this movie worth your time when you add good director and a great cast in the story full of weird surprises you get one unforgettable piece of cinematography and an excellent entertainment810,black_comedy
one has to give credit to john malkovich for allowing the film makers to use him as a character in this story and not always to flattering effect this is one of those quintessential movies to illustrate the absurd by being absurd it starts out with the kind of quirky humor that i find entertaining enough but then tries to outdo itself by getting more and more in the weeds with its intricate and often confusing treatment of personality exchanges and multiple malkovichs so in other words it wears the viewer down after a while and gets to be somewhat overbearing in its quest to be an offbeat movie actually you know youre asking for trouble when charlie sheen is called upon to give advice if youre quick enough youll be able to catch momentary glimpses of folks like brad pitt winona ryder and gary sinise some of them so quick they dont even qualify as cameos not to be too harsh its not a terrible movie and if you like off the wall writing and humor this will definitely fit the bill and to think it all started with a help wanted ad looking for a man with fast hands,black_comedy
this movie has a truly bizarre premise lets just get that out of the way off the bat before i started watching i was already excited to see how such a bizarre idea could function on screen but a lot of movies dont live up to their premise and this is one of themit isnt just the premise that is bizarre the characters are even more wacky in a strange and unfamiliar world i expect a movie to have a strong protagonist with whom i can identify this movie had no such thing the protagonist is so strange and illogical that the viewer feels like an outsider looking in for the entirety of the film when everyone on screen is a weirdo im not too invested in their interpersonal dramaweird and deep are not one in the same jonze puts a cast of weird characters on screen but he gives them no depth catherine keeners character is the supreme example of this she is supposed to be confident sexy and complex but she comes off as random illogical and weird she doesnt act like a real person she acts like a poorly written character in a film thats trying too hard to be artsynonetheless the movie packs some laughs appearances from celebrities playing themselves is always good for a smile from the audience and this film does it in an amusing way there are also two short mockumentaries within the film that are pretty much goldif you are drawn to the premise like i was or you like jonzes other work youre probably going to watch this movie i still cant recommend it,black_comedy
the main themes of the film puppets and life similitude live the life of someone else entering his brain is definitely interesting and easily creates a number of ideas brought to exasperation and paradoxical as the movie showed us including love and sex the seventh floor and a half may be cute not really meaning as well as the film that subtly shows us that some artists are immediately rewarded for the merit of being already famousthat said the rest of the movie and ideas however are too forced and uninteresting and especially not thrilling and really funny or hilarious as they could have been by not exaggerating in its contours and adding less absurdity and instead more comic comedy situations some moments make you smile not laugh as the loop by malkovich in his mind and the situation of the actor bewildered itself virtually almost involuntarily raped while some others are not really necessary or meaningfulpersonally im used to engaging and genial plots as those seen in some of terry gilliams movies malkovich is talented as always but as someone else commented it is not enough just a brilliant idea to make of a unique film a masterpiecei found some main ideas as absurd even brilliant but the film in the long run rather boring and overrated610,black_comedy
the movie starts very curiously with the puppet dance sequence the next sequence about the house full of various pets even more intrigued me while watching the story keeps on building the stupid ideas with the floor number and the literal manifestation of it and when the real john malkovich comes in well its just the real start of the craziness the movie depicts various bad values people tend to choose in order to indulge themselves from homosexuality unfaithfulness to organized crime of some sort the mob of old men rushing to john malkovichs body the acting is nice john mlakovich can keep his hard and peculiar character even though he plays the shocked character john cusack catherine keener and cameron diaz all played their parts very well defining the crucial angles for the story,black_comedy
a man who is a puppeteer finds a hole in his office the hole is connected to the inside of john malkovich who is a famous actor and everyone can experience john malkovich for 15 minutes this film describes people who change their mind by experiencing the eyes and the daily life of john malkovich the story is complex but very unique this is the strangest film that i have ever watched such as a hole connecting to the inside of a famous actor and people who are about to advantage of such a hole however this film is a comedy so i could enjoy it without thinking deeply after watching it i thought of what to do if i could become someone famous on the contrary i felt that it would be fearful if my remarks or expressions could be controlled by someone i recommend those who love strange and mysterious story to watch this film,black_comedy
finally after glimpsing scenes of this movie on tv for 14 years i decided to watch it its something ive never seen before its so original and creative sure the main plot  being someone else or being in somebody elses body or mind has definitely been done over the years but none has been so captivating and thrilling like this one but i cant help thinking about this movie as weird theres so much weird stuff going on but thats certainly what makes this movie so beautiful and unique i couldnt help but feel entrapped in that world together with the characters too yes somehow the story is written in that way to make this phenomenon seem so real and natural maybe because they took a person from the real world john malkovich his real existence behind the scenes makes us believe more in what is happening in the movie i also like to compliment the actresses  they were driving me crazy in the most curious way i cant say that there is something bad about this movie the ending was so clever and even perfect for me because it showed how all good things must come to an endat least good for someone also worth mentioning is the obsessive love that graig schwartz john cusack feels for this one woman brilliantly performed by john cusack whenever he was feeling miserable and lost i was too about john malkovich i can say he was the cherry on top of the cake,black_comedy
describing the plot of beyond a rough outline is a waste of timein the case of most films the two or three paragraphs on the reverse of the dvd cover are enough to give you a fair idea of what the film is about based upon your own tastes you should then be able to get a fair handle on whether it is for you or notwith that simply wont do it needs to be seen before you can be sure  perhaps twiceafter saying that ill try a little craig schwarz john cusack is a struggling yet talented puppeteer in a world hardly crying out for them his wife lottie cameron diaz works in a pet store and seems to take much of her work with her to the menagerie that is their hometo pay the bills craig applies for a filing job must have fast hands on the 7 th floor at a company called lestercorp where the 105 year old ceo thinks he has a speech impediment because his personal assistant cant understand what he is saying and craig works with a cocky self confident woman named maxine catherine keener who he becomes absolutely besotted byit is here that craig finds the door that leads to a portal into john malkovichs mind behind the filing cabinet for 10 minutes before dumping you near a freeway onramp in new joisyisnt it always behind the filing cabinet by now you are rolling your eyes or thinking that might be the most bizarre plot ive ever heard youre probably right on both counts but it is also one of the more brilliant genre blurring and ambitious quasi mainstream films in the last century which i guess is in film historythe film is filled with abstract and just plain oddball touches  not the least of which is best describes by two words monkey flashback  the main characters take turns lusting after each other and the nonmalkovichs are all changed by their experience inhabiting himit all seems so right when a concerned malkovich looks around desperately for someone to approach for advice and seeks the consul of one charlie sheen playing charlie sheen who thinks that a woman calling him lottie during the heights of ecstasy hot of course he does both cusack and diaz  especially diaz actually  have never looked less movie star with their unkempt and unruly hairdos and gasp blemishes malkovich is obviously playing himself and he seems to relish taking potshots at the everyday humdrum of his own everyday existence and of being constantly nearly recognised keener is unexpectedly sassy and bitchy it seems she is either used to getting her way or has decided that she doesnt care what others think of her and as always is the case those guys n gals that treat others like spam somehow manage to find themselves adored and fawned over by the very people they lord over so undeservedlythankfully they dont bother with the formal event scene that demands everyone read diaz gets done up to prove that theyshe really can be hot in real lifebut i dont think director spike jonze is even vaguely interested in doing hollywood mainstream pleasing pap it is far more enjoyable for him to indulge in a scene where malkovich enters his own mind through the door and encounters a whole society of men women and  bleh  creepy children all sporting his round bald dignified visage and saying his surname in lieu of normal speech and if that hasnt either compelled you to either look this film up or steer well clear of it then i havent done my job at allfinal rating  85  10 napoleon dynamite and will ferrell have managed to turn quirkiness into profit and undeserved millions quirk neednt be tryhard or oddball sometimes it is borderline genius isnt easily digestible but it is one of the rare films that can truly claim to be totally unique and more than a mere oddity,black_comedy
the attempt to portray the life of an internationally known actor through the eyes of random people makes this story unbelievingly funny even though i sense that the meaning of all this might be we should not interact into other peoples lives or businesses  i therefore think that the movie itself made quite well you should be someone accustomed into viewing strange and bizarre stories the start maybe what seems to be a typical drama regarding a looser puppeteer living with his wife and some animals we actually get caught into their lives till one day our protagonist finds a secret portal to starts out to be a realistic movie but the deeper you get the stranger and surreal it gets a very well written screenplay in which the information is passed onto us through different characters in different ways meaning we know exactly as much as the protagonist we know more the some characters and we certainly know way less then someone else this brings me to the editing which is good for its purpose it gets the story running never makes you feel bored and has a good rhythm as well as some pretty interesting cutsi would say the directors choice of using two different visual styles depending on who he focused makes the story much more understandable as well as funny some but far from being really innovative the screenplay again makes it so differentacting wise great each actor knows exactly the character they have to be and how to make them believable all in one id give it a 7 out of 10 for being absurdly funny unrealistically true and above all entertaining leaving you a quite indescribable aftertaste after watching the movie,black_comedy
i feel that to say that this is and odd yet interesting movie really sums it up begins just as visually interesting as it does psychologically after a wonderful marionette performance the movie really entices the audience with the fascinating seven and a half floor the characters we meet all have little tidbits about them that really make us want to know more why does the boss character not think that he can be understood what is with the dark woman who craig is lusting over these are great ways to make the audience really want to keep watchingfrom there we get to the part where the characters become john malkovich everybody loves the idea of being a celebrity actor and the lives of everyone twist out of control the idea of being able to control someone else as if they were really you seems to be the overall motif and the movie runs with that notioni give this movie a seven or a quite good rating because it is very interesting to watch and the idea of it is neat going into a real life guy instead of a made up actor for the film was excellent but i cannot give this film a higher rating because it was a bit to strange for my taste i know that some people love this type of thing and tops their list of best films ever but personally i tend to like movies with a bit more realism involvedthe last thing i want to say is that john malkovich should be commended for taking this role what an odd movie to be made about you,black_comedy
some films define what your dreams will become others help you understand what your dreams are made of maybe these two ideas are more close to each other than im willing to admit anyway this film is the second type at least to me i am a romantic incurable i cry over love uncorresponded love true love more and more these last months have been a difficult hard period in my life a time of change indecision not about love but everything else so i feel immediately like cusacks character someone who is not allowed to puppeteer all i said so far would make this film special for mebut this is cinema and thats what breaks things for me here so in what concerns cinema what we have here is the mix between an inspired and competent director two of the best actors working these days cusack and keener one really interesting mind which actually borrows himself to be the film stage quite literally malkovich and one of the best screenwriters everkaufmans writing is to some extent close to that of medem both envision the world as a black sky filled with shiny star dots than out of that sky they take a magic marker and unite dots until they shaped their own personal constellations until theyve put their souls into the sky if you are willing to track down what they mean with every dot they choose to make their own you will know that you are in a different world not at all separated from our own because it intersects it but truly youll be inside someones head you will not control it you will not puppeteer it but youll be blessed the difference though between medem and kaufman is that the first one directs what he writes always so we have always a coordinated vision that strikes every bit of what we see kaufman collaborates and in the process gains what the directors have to give but takes the chance of being misunderstood in this film all the compensations and personal interpretations by the main creative intervenients seem perfectly balanced to me this is a sweet experience something you will not forgetspike jonze has a career as a video clip director and that shows he takes the visual representation of cusacks dramatizations to a high level and thats a fundamental piece of the metaphor puppeteering the illusion of a created life on stage taken to staged lives in the real world how schwartz has to become another person in order to become himself in order to freely express in order to get the illusion of true love what a true drama that is how maxine bends the benders deceives the deceivers manipulates everybody even those who are supposed to be the manipulators only to find out she shouldnt how lotte is the ultimate manipulated woman and because of that is the only uncorrupted how malkovich ultimately doesnt exist how lester is the closest to god that we have on filmundecisions half way between places half floors channels between people people as vessels which can contain multiple selfs creating literally your own reality by blurring the definitions of self this is as much about love as it is about the process of living that love this is as much about truth as it is about what truth means this is as much about a story as it is about how to tell stories this is as much a film as it is an essay about making films about cinema this is a master piece of selfreferencemy opinion 55 probably eternal sunshine tops this but this will be a part of you if youll allow ithttpwww7eyeswordpresscom,black_comedy
watching a movie based on the highly talented charlie kaufmans unique screenplays has been like a magical surreal experience some examples include the terrific adaptation and the phenomenal eternal sunshine of the spotless mind is another magnificent addition and this time it is spike jonze who has the honour to direct such a film jonze has taken something innovative refreshing witty clever highly amusing and thoroughly engaging and made it into a thrilling engrossing experience the film is carefully layered with philosophy the humour is dark in a subtle way and it induces laughter the performances are first rate john cusack and cameron diaz who are barely recognizable here deliver some of their finest and most nuanced performances catherine keener looks incredibly hot and acts with a natural spontaneity at least thats how it appears orson bean stands out in a supporting role and of course john malkovich does a superb job playing himself kaufman has definitely worked his magic again its amazing how someone can come up with such an intriguing concept and make such a spellbinding and invigorating story of it that leads to a surrealistic experience,black_comedy
okay okay im just going tothrow my hands in the air and disregard everything i ever knew about movies because this film is just soflat out bizarre weird and boneheaded at times that theres nothing else to do about it lets just address the first and foremost question why john malkovich did you just pick an actors name out of a hat maybe im just too young or something but god damn you could have theoretically picked any actor couldnt you did you just pick him because his last name is so catchy to say i think thats why yeah that must be itsecondits a movie about a portal into his brain which is admittedly a really interesting idea it sure sold me this movie is justi dont know its really strange and it really leaves an impression on you there are a lot of things i like about this its artistic its cryptic and its got really excellent writing as much of a head trip haha as this movie is it sure is good at keeping you drawn in there really is a sense of comedic genius at work here just in the plot itself and its underscored with a heavy layer of remorseful sadness this is at its core a movie about longing and chasing ones dreams when you cut out the weird bullshit thats what it is and the unique way in which the movie shows you this just makes it stellarbut i do have some problems with this likegod what is up with some of the other comedy in this film like that stuff with the monkey with childhood trauma and the whole first quarter of this is pretty much just completely insane a lot of the time it just leaves you gaping at the screen rather than laughing and im not sure thats a good thing the jokes are rarely funny and are more confusing and odd than anything and it hurts the film especially in the beginningis one of a kind its really juststrange but the gems here are hard to deny if you are actually crazy enough to stick around long enough for them,black_comedy
this movie is one of the weirdest i have ever seen a lot of the scenes were a bit on the perverse side the movie was enjoyable though fairly entertaining it has an interesting plot going through a tunnel in a building and on the other side you find yourself in the head of john malcovich its a pretty good movie to watch it has what one would want out of a comedy it is much more imaginative than a lot of comedies i just think the bizarre plot went a little too far towards the end catherine keener was adequate not great i thought she was actually better in evan almighty though evan is not a better film john cusack was pretty good hes done some better acting though i didnt like cameran diaz very much in this movie she is normally much better in everything else i have seen her in the holiday in her shoes john malcovich definitely did the best acting he was actually good in this movie as himself this movie is a bit on the creepy side the way people enter other peoples minds like shopping malls other than that it was pretty good though,black_comedy
as a film is refreshingly innovative as before its making no one in the world has ever dared to make a film about one of american cinemas greatest actors john malkovichs enigmatic personalityit is not only the presence of john malkovich which increases audiences appreciation of the film but also the talented writer director duo charlie kaufman and spike jonzes joint artistic cooperationit would be a crying shame to label as a black comedy as the issues tackled in the film go beyond the simple realm of mirththe idea is to create laughter but not at the cost of social issuesthis is one of the plausible reasons why spike jonze chose to highlight the plight of helpless caged animals in order to elicit some sympathy not only from peta activists but also from general members of the societyas is a film about arts and artists it has done a truly commendable job by showing all and sundry that puppetry is a dying artthe best thing which can be learned by watching this film is that it can be made popular by associating a couple of popular figures to itall artists are eccentric they would go to any extentcross any limits and perform any task in order to perpetually bask in glorythe audience gets to get a grip over some of truly wacky artistsliveseverybody would like to become famous and would even pay for itthis funny aspect has been shown to make all human beings realize that strange are the vagaries of human mind,black_comedy
mate said to watch this movie saying it was really good so i didjohn cusack almost unrecognizable at first did a great job playing craig schwartz a puppeteer who is getting no where and so gets himself a job filing at an office on the 7 12 floorfor short peoplecameron diaz plays his wife who works at a pet shop and is a bit of a weird character especially when craig finds a door that is a portal to john malkovichs headi found the concept a good one and it was slightly funny it doesnt focus on being comedic i did find the movie was getting weirder and weirder as it drew closer to the conclusion and some parts i think that couldve been left outbut otherwise was an alright movie,black_comedy
this comment it is not a spoiler one and it is very short indeed hi everyone i liked this movie very much its very original nowadays since hollywood uses the clonation as the main creative method its getting difficult to watch such a different movieif anyone is interested in mixed up identity movies i would suggestmulholland drive  david lynch  httpusimdbcomtitle0166924  spider  david cronenberg httpusimdbcomtitle0278731,black_comedy
although ive been a long time fan of john malkovich this movie just blew me away  i cant remember the last time such an original was made  the acting is great the plot is outrageous and the storyline was the best ive seen in years  ,black_comedy
without a doubt the most ingenious movie ive ever seen  and along with that goes some superb acting  but i ask myself did i take anything away with me after seeing this movie  did it make me think was i talking about it the next day  nope  ill talk about how creative the idea was and how well they pulled it off but i have yet to say you have to go see this movie    im not even sure how i would go about recommending this movie what can you compare it to  is it possible to start a sentence by saying if you liked  then youll love  the closest thing i could come up with would be brazil,black_comedy
short and sweet i had very high expectations going into this movie i was not disappointed if you like john malkovich john cusack or cameron diaz you will probably like this movieby the way there were no cheesy lines about malkovich and cusack both being in con air,black_comedy
is one of those movies that takes me in so completely that i dont even realize ive been taken charlie kaufmans script is so offbeat and offthewall that it could be completely unbelievable however spike jonzes direction style nails the script to a tee it wasnt until afterwards that i questioned the ideas in the movie and realized how unbelievable it really was but it was also unbelievably smart and funny the movies creative subtlety was amazing i loved it,black_comedy
it is often difficult when leaving a movie this weird to tell exactly what you thought of it  i was pretty sure with this one that i liked it but i had to think a while what made the movie so clever   after some consideration i do not agree that this movie really raises any philosophical questions or provides a new perspective on identity or such things  any points where a difficult conceptual situation arises is dealt with more by humor than with wisdom  but like brazil and even the fifth element its genius lies directly in its weirdness and how it simply attacks the stability of ones preconceptions and beliefs in general after a movie like this life just doesnt seem so simple any more so closely bound by rules  and this movie i think does it better than any other outrageous plot aside every character down to their reactions to each event is so wholly absurd that it is just too much insanity to process all at once  but in the end after a slight change in ones mindset and perhaps a slight loss of sanity the nonsense does seem to make quite a bit of sense  it is impressive that a movie so bizarre could still be so coherently put together  many surreal movies such as some kubrick and the aforementioned brazil kind of leave you completely lost at the end but this one doesnt leave many holes  i think that just about anyone will leave the movie feeling odd but with no regrets  as a side note the acting in all cases is also superb  for each main actor it is probably their best performances  as i said the characters are so odd it must have been quite a task to make them seem at all real  as another side note the puppeteering is amazing  if you can do such things with puppets then i would certainly care to be exposed to more of it,black_comedy
in the midst of the formulaic action adventure star studded mass merchandising vehicles that are the stock fare of suburban multitheatre complexes comes a quirky original fun and funny film that wont appeal to all tastes  in fact at the screening i attended several people walked out halfway through and not to get a refill on their gallon of coke and megabucket of popcorn they are the poorer for their decision  this movie presents john cusack and cameron diaz playing against type and for brilliant comic effect and john malkovich playing himself sometimes in a mixed up world of bizarre concepts characters and situations  catherine keener was superb as the love interest of sorts and charlie sheen adds comic flair as himself in a cameo appearance  directed by spike jonze of fat boy slim praise you video fame we must praise him for providing welcome relief to the constant flow of mainstream mind numbing big screen big sound  well you get the idea,black_comedy
this is not the greatest movie i have ever seen  but i could not tell you why  i have a friend who explains it as it has everything i have ever liked ever in it  this is certainly true  this movie is one of the smartest funniest best exceptional outstanding films i have ever seen i have seen a lot of films  it is difficult to explain it has so much monkeys john cusack puppets visions of hell visions of heaven swimming the new jersey turnpike brad pitt oh yeah and that crazy amazing genius brilliant wacky guy john malkovich  hes in it a bit  i loved him in that jewelthief movie  see this movie  see it now  if youve seen it see it again i will be there with my john malkovich mask and nametag that says hello my name is john malkovich  i swear i dont usually obsess about movies this way  this one is special,black_comedy
i found myself laughing wholeheartedly at so many completely unexpected and bizarre scenes in this movie  what could have been a good movie was made astounding by the sheer audacity of having john malkovich actually playing himself as a character a brief jaunt through his subconscious made me wonder as to the honesty of it  a full force tumble through someones brain through the eyes of three very needy and occasionally cruel people  addiction love betrayel integrity and just a little drool,black_comedy
this is one of those great films that leaves half the audience wanting to give oscars to the whole cast and crew and the other half shaking their heads saying what the    one of the best dark humor farces ive seen in years it feels like it takes a while to get into the story of the film and the ending is a bit odd but its an odd movie my advice  bring out the warped side of your sense of humor and enjoy this way offkilter view of the world the human state of consciousness relationships the work environment celebrity etc,black_comedy
it is very difficult to summon ones thoughts about this film because it was so bizarre  all i know is that i had a smile on my face all through itthe acting was amazing and i think that john cusack should be nominated for an academy award for best actor and catherine keener for best supporting actress  cameron diaz was also great and orson bean was a delight as dr lester  the stage is set for absurdity from the very beginning when john cusack has to apply for a job on floor 7 12 and the image of all the employees walking around all hunched over because the ceiling is so low still makes me chuckle  the story is so strange that you just have to accept it for the fantasy that it is go through the little door and shoot down the tube for the ride i dont know if there were any hidden existential meanings but i sure did enjoy myself  bravo  another great film in 1999,black_comedy
saw this one sunday night late show in santa cruz and felt free to laugh out loud at every joke i got and take the hints from the audience that split a gut at every joke they got i havent laughed this much at a movie since  puppet master performs abelard and heloise gets a straight job filing in the 7 12 th floor finds portal into jms brain has crush on evil manipulative witch who talks him into charging admission she treats customers like a 200 hookerok you get 15 miniutes of fame but you get to experience it through a real life celebrity  morality tales examination of the id and ego boundries of the individual all that is there to think about afterwards but while watching youll be too busy laughingwarning  do not try to explain the plotline to anyone whohasnt seen it  they will think youre crazy and no one would believe it anyway,black_comedy
i dont recall another fantasy film eg edward scissorhands that didnt box itself into a corner at some point  here the filmakers imagination never fails  the plot elements comedy and symbolism are elegantly interwoven to create a joyride that never fails to fascinate bravo,black_comedy
we may be looking at best original screenplay 1999 john cusack again thrills as the man on the edge of control and i loved the tunnel whoosh as it harkened to billted yes this is definitely worth searching far and wide for a theater showing this film  outrageous idea very well executed in a way which almost teases you forever about when do we become john malkovich as if we were also clientele on the 7 12 floormalkovich isnt always a weird character  his biff in 1986s death of a salesman with dustin hoffman was straightlaced but my lack of knowing that malkovich is supposed to be synonymous with oddity didnt detract from my enjoyment of the film at all  it could have been anyonea mustsee  even a mustseeagain,black_comedy
and that is a good thing  from the conception of the title to the outline of the story down to the preview of the film  this movie no doubt was going to be either the stupidest creation from some pretty screwed up mindsor it was going to be pure genius from some of todays most creative film makersgenius it very well was  i mean whose eyes would it be better to see through than john malcovichs  not many  john malcovich deserves academy recognition for this film even though hes just acting like himself for most of the movie  and john cusack gives his best performance yet as the man who discovers the portal to the unknown ie john malcovichs headto compare this movie to anything else would be impossible  it stands on its own and may singlehandedly redefine the weird movie genre as raiders of the lost ark and die hard did for the action genre and scream did for the horror genre being john malcovich is one of the top 25 best films of the 90s  to me it was more than just a simple viewing experience  it opened up a new light to entertainment thinking and film making  whether you like this film or not is beside the question  you will acknowledge how much different it was than anything you have ever seen or ever will see again,black_comedy
i just saw a workprint of this movie i must say its one of the better movies ive seen this year  its getting away from the typical suspense hollywood flick  this was one of the most creative productions probably since this was produced by michael stipe and directed by spike jonze  the performances by cameron diaz john cusak and elizabeth keener were amazingjohn malkovich also gives a stellar performance of being himself and letting others be him  the end has a very nice touch it reminds you of one of nirvanas music videos  if you dont like the actors youll love the premise behind the story,black_comedy
this movie is wonderful see it as soon as you can it is incredibly funny absurdistslapstick humor pokes fun at postmodernism and shows off plenty of malkovich being malkovich i found the ending a bit disappointing i think the movie tries too hard in general to explain things instead of just leaving them be strange,black_comedy
maybe its just me but this whole movie seemed like a parallel to how a directors life in hollywood is how they have to create their artistic visions with the use of hollywood celebrities how theyre supposedly complete losers who make it big and then are insecure for the rest of their lives about losing that success how theyre supposedly easily manipulated by beautiful women into giving them parts in their movies and how supposedly they make movies because they are for some reason unable to live normal lives so have to live vicariously through characters that they can control unlike the characters in their lives and when john malkovich goes through the portal whoah that was just the perfect visualization of the egocentric actors desire for the world to revolve around him becoming a nightmarish reality and then with john cusack being a dark crazyhaired unshaven nerd who likes playing with puppets tim burton an his nightmare before christmas anyone this whole  director metaphor seemed to suddenly be more than just a wild rant in my mind but to actually have something to do with the story behind this seemingly nonsequitur film or am i just crazy if anyone whos reading this knows anything about what the writer and director of this movie meant when they created this please email me or even if im on the right track at least email me to reassure me that i am im pretty sure is supposed to be just taken at face value but wheres the fun in that,black_comedy
being john malkovitch was not excellent  my overall recommendation is to see it to appease your curiosity it is intriguing and well done but it runs slow at times and would make a better twilight zone episode than a feature film,black_comedy
is the most creative movie i have seen in quite some time it is well made and i liked the actors involved john cusack cameron diaz however the strangeness of the movie keeps me from enjoying the overall production a close call some of it is very funny but in the end i can recommend it 6,black_comedy
this movie is a highly strange and surreal look at self and obsession its unique premise is easily what makes the movie worth seeing yet it really does not delve all that deeply into those questions if youd like to get a clue to the answers of the ideas proposed by this movie you wont find them here  thats why it does not get a total thumbs up but it does have a very quirky sense of humor and on the the whole is funny enough to be worth seeing i dont think anyone will look back ten years from now and define this one as a classic however,black_comedy
let me start off by saying is a very good movie its one of the most interesting unusual and thoughtprovoking films ive seen this year i still cant believe malkovich himself agreed to star in it and i still have the sublimely ridiculous themes and surreal images i saw a week ago in my head the acting is solid the directing is good the writing is sharp and the story is compellingso why wasnt i wholly satisfied by this movie why do i feel now as i did when the credits were rolling that something was missing and that this work is overrated well having some distance i think ive figured it out it has to do with sympathy for the characters basically i didnt have anyeach character is flawed to such a degree through greed selfishness and insecurity that heshe ultimately comes off as a twodimensional puppet i found it impossible to put myself in anyones shoes ironically because none of them are comfortable in their own the characters who succeed are the ones who are the most adept at using and abusing the other characters and of course at abusing the body of john malkovich catherine keeners character makes a point in the film about how there are those who take what they want and then theres everybody else im paraphrasing that point is explored in the film but ultimately the message and i only mention this because the film does have philosophical aims becomes its a dogeatdog world out there  there is no love no moral anchor  and thats why despite its very clear style and simple but intriguing plot i couldnt totally get into itthe characters go through changes which are wholly believable and uplifting rent it,black_comedy
getting into someones head is a clich that gets visual representation in the film a funny inventive original absurd picture that unfortunately falls on its own absurdity  to explain the reasoning behind why anything happens here would be asking one to think which would destroy all the enjoyment this movie offers the movie displays comical spurts and dances around the issue of sexual identity but ultimately falls like a row of cards because its weirdness is too much  it cant escape its own absurdity just like john malkovich cannot escape seeing everyone looking exactly like him when he enters his own portal after a certain point this film runs out of mindless humor and it just plain trite,black_comedy
this is probably the most imaginative film to come out since fargo  it reminded me of a live action wallace and grommit cartoon which also seem blissfully unfettered by reality when constructing a story line  cusak has always been one of my favorite actors and he is great here  cameron diaz once again proves shes more than just a pretty face and great body and terrific legs and well john malkovich deserves a supporting actor nomination  the only annoying thing is that catherine keener is one of those actresses who doesnt mind nude scenes as long as shes not exactly naked so you have a couple of austin power type scenes where shes covered by absurdly strategically placed sheets or pillows  but thats quibblingif you like movies that arent made by a cookie cutter youll love this film,black_comedy
in the great tradition of alice in wonderland and eraserhead comes spike jonzes totally original and captivating fantasy  the movies originality is especially welcome in a time when almost every film to come out of hollywood is either a sequel a remake or a knockoff  john cusack is craig schwartz an unemployed puppeteer who gets a job as a file clerk in a strange office with low ceilings on the 712th floor harry potter fans will be reminded of platform 934  it is here that he discovers a portal that sucks you into the head of john malkovich for exactly 15 minutes a nod to andy warhol and then dumps you beside the new jersey turnpike  all this has to be seen to be grasped  and its just for starters  the film never runs out of surprises  the fact that writer charlie kaufman could have thought up a story like this is only half as amazing as the fact that it could be successfully brought to the screen  jonze deserves an oscar nod  the movie has more ideas on its mind than it can tackle little things like celebrity identity consciousness sex and death but never mind  it is amazing and hilarious the whole way  john malkovich also deserves an oscar for accepting such a risky role and for doing it so brilliantly  it will be the first time an actor is nominated for portraying himself,black_comedy
first of all im surprised that this movie is even playing in town we never get anything independent but we do get the double jeopardys and the american pies in every theatre around town second of all ill have to see it as many times i can before it gets shoved out of town this movie definitely is everything you heard earlier hilarious thoughtprovoking bizzare chock full of ideas and themes and least of all brilliant all the actors are terrific ebert is right with this one this has to be nominated for a best picture come oscar time but it probably wont simply because not that many people will see it i dont want to talk about it in case of spoiling it but just go see it,black_comedy
first things first lets all applaud spike jonze and charlie kaufman for creating such an incredible and original piece of film second lets give props to all the actors especially cameron diaz for showing diversity with roles none of them have ever done before even malkovich gives a superb performance aswellhimself its so refreshing to see a completely new and original film the movie is full of non stop laughs laughs that are not over the top to the point of stupidity all though there are times where it is appropriate but laughs that are still laugh out loud funny i couldnt help but feel like i was watching a real good terry gilliam film cause even the farfetched seemed believable in this movie this movie is definitely gonna make an impact on films to come and hopefully its a good sign of where hollywood is heading,black_comedy
what a clever and original film  it takes an outlandish premise that somewhere in nyc theres a portal to john malkovichs brain and somehow i believed it  this was done through inspired casting great direction a fine musical score and a wonderful and inventive screenplay by charlie kaufman  all the lead performances were excellent  i have to single out cameron diazs performance as exceptional as i really could not believe that was her under that gruesome fright wigps what i noticed later is that this film tips its hat to one of my favorite movies kieslowskis the double life of veronique with its puppeteering subplot and its premise of a linked sense of human identity,black_comedy
what a ride  man i wish i could have been inside charlie kaufmans head when he came up with this premise  is one of those rare films like the truman show and groundhog day that is able to take a potentially dicey premise and go all the way with it  its not only amazing that kaufman was able to conceive something so strange but its tantamount to a cinematic miracle that he was able to weave it into a tale that within itself unfolds with impeccable consistency and logic  kudos for thatthe actors also serve the material well  it was particularly nice to see cameron diaz doing such passionate committed work  after theres something about mary a lame film with a boring heroine diaz could have played in her sleep  how strange it must be for john malkovich to watch this film  its probably one of the most original texts on acting and its links to identity ever madeoverall i was very taken with this film and am still a little exhilarated from the experience  one bone of contention however  spike jonze needs to buy a tripod  handheld camera only works in very rare instances when the material really demands it saving private ryan otherwise its just the camera calling attention to itself the impostors  let us linger on what youre showing us  your film will only be better,black_comedy
the crowning achievement of charlie sheens acting career this movie is impossible to describe it was simply original and very good i am still wondering what the real john malkovich was thinking when presented with the script either he felt that his ego was being stroked or charlie kaufman the writer was obsessed with him and should be considered dangerous,black_comedy
is it still okay to express admiration for this movie i know theres a danger of people getting like pulp fiction bores over the amount they enthuse about it but even a couple of years after seeing it this film still sticks with me i cant wait for all the other projects being made from charlie kauffman scripts to come out,black_comedy
although some of the characters undergo change during the course of the film none of it happens on camera  were told characters have had profound changes in perspective but we dont get to see it the events of the film are interesting and sometimes laugh out loud funny but  they dont add up to much it seems as though were asked to draw some philosophical conclusion from the events but we arent given enough material to do so the early commentary on the hell of some job situations was terrific but didnt play out  for hardcore movie fans only id think,black_comedy
i really dont know where to startcraig schwartz is an outofwork pupeteer who finds a job working on the 7 12th floor of a skyscraper whilst retreiving a fallen file from behind a cabinet hes amazed to find a tunnel the tunnel allows anyone who enters to see hear and in all senses feel what it is like to be john malkovich for roughly a few minutes before being spat out just above the new jersey turnpikeobviously its a lot more complicated than that  what with coworker maxine becoming craigs love interest before eventually becoming lottes love interst also after experiencing being malkovich lotte comes to the conclusion that she is a man trapped in a womans body and the whole concept on trying to capitalise on such a discovery  you realise quickly that this film will abandon any kind of sane plot very early onthe film is great up until around halfway through where the underlying theme of craziness gets replaced by a more desperate kind after having seen it both at the cinema and on dvd i feel that the two senses jar uncomfortablyhowever the film is packed full of hilarious sketches including the history of the 7 12th floor induction video and well worth the price of a rental,black_comedy
well the premise really intrigue me when i had seen the trailers and i thought this was just the esoteric type of stuff that would really intrigue me i am not sure why i didnt like it maybe i expected it to be a comedy and just didnt find it to be at all humorous i sat there wondering why it was instead of being jim carrey or being joe pesci he existence was so boring i just couldnt buy people standing in line to pay for their chance at john malkovich 510 is my vote,black_comedy
this movie was not a dissapointment the movie is so weird its fun the acting was good and so was story i laughed alot the direction by spike jonze was great its stands next to saving private ryan and fight club as one of my favorite movies of all time its one of the best of the century,black_comedy
im glad this film was finally made its time the public had the oppertunity to see what our lives are like ive been john malkovich for periods of time roughly 15 min each for about 3 years now none of my friends understood me finally with this movie people can start to understand where im coming from without it im just a liar,black_comedy
i dont know if it was just me but the feel of this film reminded me a little of edward scissorhands  in that it was a modern fantasy that worked the people who dont get this film also fail to accept it as a fantasy  instead trying to shoehorn it into a comedypsycological drama genre with some deep meaningpersonally i would loved to have been in the head of whomever had the audacity to pitch this concept to the suits at the studio well its about an unsuccessful puppeteer and his pet shop owner wife cameron diaz but really ugly who find a secret doorway into the mind of john malkovich  in an unusual office building,black_comedy
i have to say that i am pretty disappointed with the film  maybe the film is too hyped up or something  or critics just wanna love this film trying to make themselves believe that the film is deeper than it is intended to be  the premise of the film is definitely pretty original and there are some interesting scenes but what it has got to say is really nothing revolutionary or even worth spending time figuring outi walked out feeling as empty as the time i felt after watching the megalame theres something about mary  at least mary didnt try to be deep maybe i should have left my brain at the door and i think i would have enjoyed malkovich so much better as a farce for the mindless,black_comedy
there is little than can be said about this film without giving anything away  so i find that i must restrain myself  except to say that it is brilliant thoughtprovoking stunning and will be imitated  but not successfullyi applaud the john malkovich for even allowing this film to be made  not to mention his incredible acting in itit brings up the question of how does one play ones selfastoundingly in this case  and of course who could do it betterwonderful casting  orson bean  mary kay place and i quite honestly did not know that cameron diaz was in this film so i kept wondering who that familiar face was  but didnt know until the final credits were rollinggreat cameos too  charlie sheen brad pitt sean penn  i laughedjohn cusak is as always on the edge of sanity  but he does it so wellthis will be a classic  see it,black_comedy
i think one of the reasons some people hate this movie is that the movie breaks the hollywood code that requires characters to be clearly either good guys or bad guys and there has to be either a happy or sad ending the ending is twisted and youre not sure what to make of it  the characters are all selfcentered and controlling but have a few positive quirks which may or may not make up for their flaws perhaps the movie would be easier to deal with if the characters were a bit more stylized or cartoonish rather than having some human characteristics that you have some sympathy fori found me asking myself am i supposed to feel sorry for the puppeteer or for the pet woman lotte or maxine but then i realized  wait this movie is weird  you dont have to worry about feeling confused  elijah is probably the only character that you can really sympathize with,black_comedy
a wonderful cast great acting great sets and sensational filmingthough i highly recommend seeing this movie one would hope that there is another ending or version of this film that never made it to the final cutting because they lost the footage or because the people in the focus groups involved in the previewing of this film were also antidepressants test subjects for merck and were disturbed by the original ending so marketing softened itread the other reviews know that you will be pulled into this world of puppeteering  portals but also know that the ending is a great disappointmentthis film had great potential  applause to the cast and crew but whoever made the final decision as to the ending of this film should stay after school,black_comedy
this movie is cetainly different with a totally unique plot and set of circumstances john cusack is great in it and for the first hour the whole thing is bizarrely entertaining after that much of the movie is quite contrived and really quite dull the problem is malkovich himself his life seems just to be one big snooze if this  is anything to go by who would pay money to be in his head  now if it was being robert downey jnr that might be more fun,black_comedy
i cant recall seeing a movie with absolutely no protaganists that i could actually cherish until bjm when i first saw being john malchovich in the theaters i was amused and intrigued i was also put off by the unsavory characters and a cryptic rather hollow ending but the damn thing haunted me so i watched it again im now into my third viewing it just gets better theres so much more to it than meets the eye i cant really say anything about bjm that hasnt already been said by others with the exception that if at first your turned off by what you see try againjust onceyou never know,black_comedy
yes it begins nice weird strange creative they show you a nice main character you like from the beginning the first 34 parts of the movies i was thinking about giving it a 1010 in the imdb but god what did they do with the last quarter of the moviespoilers i think theyre aheadwhy did they let it be so sad why did they let our main character inside that girl without a real family oh how sad and it began so good so happy hey we liked the puppeteerend of spoilers710 good but it could be better,black_comedy
not just originality but originality that works  its stranger than groundhog day and it works too  this film creates a strange plot with strange circumstances and does what hollywood often fails to achieve which is to explain all the reasons behind a strange plota  why there is a door to someones head in an office building b  what is serves as c  what it could be used as for manipulation longevity etc d  what would happen if malkovich went inside his own head e  what would happen if more than one person went inside someones head at once f  why there is a 7 12 floorthe ending comes off making you feel really akward and this is perhaps intensified by the background music  but this is really a film about manipulation and the dangerous reality that encompasses being someone else craig swartz is a loser who finds potency through manipulation of someone else  he meets maxine who like craig likes to manipulate people but through her appearance and wits instead of through puppets  they find a door into malkovichs head and join forces  but soon craig and lottie want more so they turn into manipulating malkovich to achieve their own satisfaction  but soon it creates a backlash of marital problems which are so strange it seems jerry springer is an inevitable course for the two on top of this maxine uses both craig and lottie who are in malkovich to achieve her own ends and be ontop of the world  but as it all unfolds the problems catch up to craig and lottie and the serious consequences are too weird to express and definitely must be seen  1010 and thats a rare mark for me,black_comedy
this was a good concept film that would have been served substantially better by a much shorter running time 60 minutes or lessit gets to the point in this where you just wonder how much longer they can stretch the concept,black_comedy
i wouldnt say the film is the best ive ever seen  i would quite readily admit that it is one of the weirdest  very funny good solid entertainment but no more than that  an interesting idea wellrendered on screen i found the main characters with the exception of malkovich to be a bit on the unbelievable side  the transitions that the characters make do not seem to be supported by the story or the dialogue  the acting jobs were quite excellent especially malkovich but i think that the material was lacking i think some of the ideas brought up in the film were intriguing but the film doesnt really delve into them which is a bit disappointing does everyone have a portal  who does  is there only one  why  what does it really mean etc still worth a matinee its was good fun to see,black_comedy
bjm was a very disturbing and depressing fantasy film i felt utterly depressed after watching this film the reason i rented it was because someone recommended it as a good bud smoking movie in other words a movie you watch while under the influence of a mind altering substance i dont do drugs but this movie sure made me feel like i did i felt all the experiences of a druggy the highs and the lows i felt highs during the beginning when i thought this was going to be a good and interesting film and i felt withdrawal after discovering halfway throughout that it wasnt towards the end of the film i was left pondering my own existence and my feelings of depression i tell you this movie definitely makes you feel like youre on drugs they should show this film to people who think they might want to take drugs itll make them change their mind real quick but if you are a marijuana user ill once again echo the sentiments of someone who recommended this film to me and say that it is indeed a good bud smoking movie and if youre not stay far far away from it unless you like films that depress you or make you feel suicidal,black_comedy
i first heard about this movie from a friend  he didnt like it at all and his description of the plot was somewhat interesting  i wanted to see it and judge for myself  so like any faithfull imdber i immediately got on the net and looked it up  the reviews were amazing  very highly praised ok i gotta see it nowi have seen enough movies in my life to appreciate a movie like this  it is original funny interesting engrossing and smart all at the same time it doesnt condescend to reach those viewers who simply want something to watch  it aims high and acomplishes a lot  im not gonna describe the story  if you are reading this then you must have already lookedeverything was well thought out and executed to near perfection  the acting is superb the music is interesting and of course the plot is fantastic i try not to be opinionated but anyone who thought this was boring has a vision and mindframe as narrow as the tunnel leading into johns head  but i guess i can sympathize  this movie is not for idiots  it is not to be watched it is to be experienced  you have to pay attention to catch the little gags and the cleverest bits and found here  after i saw this i called my friend and told him that i thought it was the most inventive and thoughtprovoking movie i have seen in a long time  i hope if you are now inspired to go watch it again or for the first time you share my enthusiasm1010,black_comedy
but even so it is one weird film or unique or inventive or a masterpiece or garbage hey it depends on your perspective and how insightful you can be with new styles of filmsbut if you want to rubbish this film at least you can acknowledge that so many other viewers  and critics  rate it so high,black_comedy
unlike anything ive ever seen spike jonze gives a brilliant and inspired vision this guy should have moved on from music videos a long time ago i cant wait to see what project he will take on next incrediblly funny performances were given by the entire cast especially malkovich keener and diaz although it is an excellent film the offbeat nature and unexplored territory will not be enjoyed by all moviegoers definetely one of the best movies of the year and most probably the most daringly original film to come along in a long time,black_comedy
open up a bottle of alcoholcontainingfluid kick back and enjoy while this diamond of a movie reveals all the things you thought nobody ever wondered about but you did mankinds desire to poses something that is really out of his reach is being fulfilled in this ultimate joyride viewers start your engines,black_comedy
this is a really refreshing film to see finally a totally original film combined with a plot thats well worked out all of the rules in filmmaking are thrown overboard and yet were left not with a bunch of unstable rubbish but with a very satisfying final result acting is great notably malkovich himself and the unrecognisable diaz is good as well some scenes are completely hilarious i get the feeling that its a string of comments on society rather than a coherent plot but somehow it all feels related when i watched jonze in an interview talking about it i couldnt gain any insight into this guy hes totally nuts if you ask me but hes still a brilliant filmmaker,black_comedy
what starts out as a comedy centered around a failing puppeteer quickly escalates to a scifihumorous picture about ones ability to look through the eyes of the actor john malkovich a different type of humor is used throughout the film that has you guessing as to where the picture is actually going film has many stars including charlie sheen that all play themselves kind of depressing at times and is oscar nominating material 3 stars4 stars,black_comedy
did anyone else notice that not a single newcomer to 712 ever bumped hisher head on the low ceiling  amazing  the plot has an ingenious and fascinating idea  briefly inhabiting the mind of someone else  but loses it in an explanation by orson bean thats outandout garbage  and superfluous  dont explain it just do it  some great sequences particularly malkovich going into his own mind and seeing himself in everyone else  high point of the movie,black_comedy
so much has been written about this picture and indeed it is superb i thought of alice in wonderland as i was watching the scenes in the office building where the environment has shrunk also the portal is similar to that which alice passes through i am sure one could write a whole thesis on the myth and metaphysics in this picture i like what was not done in this picture they did not take a scifi approach and hook the visitors to electrodes in order to transport them into malkovich this was done in the cell the portal in an office building made this movie believable i hardly recognized camreon diaz until the end she should have received an oscar for her performance but it was hilary swanks year  give this a 975 out of 10,black_comedy
first of this movie is odd  weird its different this turns many people away but i personally have much more respect for movies with a taste of originality but that isnt enough to make a movie great and is not the reason why i love this movieit is so clever my favorite example of this is the allusions to  the monkeys traumatic childhood experience and then later the flashback from the monkeys point of view when he and his parents were capturedthe setting is awesome  taking the world we know and just twisting a little bit the characters are awesome no they are not likable for the most part  the only character to be sympathized with is poor malkovich whos body gets taken over the plot was much more intricate than i imagined from the previews and the end is perfection,black_comedy
ive just read the previous comments from imdb users and i think that together they sum up this movie it seems to be seen as how you are as an individual personally i found this movie innovative with a dream like quality about it i couldnt make my mind up whether it is a pointless film or a film with a deep meaning i think the begining where the secretary says  i cant understand a word you are saying and the boss saying please try to understand my speech affliction when there is nothing wrong with his speech sums it up as a nightmarish  movie ive seen a lot worse and ive seen a lot better but rarely have i seen a more original movie,black_comedy
when i rented i knew the just of the story and thought i knew what to expect  i was so wrong the film is about craig schwartz john cusack a puppeteer who slowly realises that puppeteering is out and is pushed by his wife cameron diaz to get a job schwartz finds a job as filing papers in an office building where he meets the very beautiful maxine who he becomes infatuated with whilst in his office schwartz discovers a door in a wall which leads into the head of none other than john malkovich allowing him to see through his eyes i think that originality is what makes a good film and is exactly that  this film is filled with humour drama and total entertainment,black_comedy
the twilight zone is back in this oddball independent film in which a puppeteer discovers a portal behind his cabinet that leads to the mind of actor john malkovich things get dangerous when his wife a virtually unrecognizable cameron diaz and sexpot office worker catherine keener fall in love through one person which is malkovich a very bizarre movie with a very weird ending great writing though and charlie sheen is in top form spoofing himself,black_comedy
unique oneofakind inspiring funny what more can i say i really loved this movie,black_comedy
is easily the best movie of 1999  i can understand why some people may not like this movie  if you dont have a sense of humor twisted mind or dont like the lines of fiction and reality being crossed you probably wont like this movie  however these three elements are the only areas you can fault this movie  but then again isnt that is what most movies are about fantasylike brazil this movie is highly satirical but it doesnt get too serious and it doesnt have a blunt message like the former movie  it is just meant to be enjoyed for what it is  i guess you could fault the movie for the lack of message but that isnt the pointjonze has created this whole fantasy world firmly grounded in reality that we can explore through the course of the movie  being in johns head is quite an experience  and then john being in johns head is mindblowing i wont spoil it for people who havent seen the movie  these elements combined with the 712 floor a petobsessed wife and tour scheme make this movie greatthis movie accomplished brilliantly what the last action hero failed miserably at reality and fiction can coexist without ruining a movie easily a 1010best line oh you are that guy from that jewel thief movie,black_comedy
is a truly unique movie one of the most bizarre and creative concepts ever captured on film spike jonze and charlie kaufman deserve high praise for unleashing their warped minds and creating a film that almost defies comparison yet it has a number of flaws that cant be overlooked this is certainly a good movie but i dont consider it to be a true classicfirst of all it drags on far too long in particular the beginning scenes prior to the discovery of the portal are almost painfully overextended and barely held my interest the dialogue was also very stilted at times after craig first visits the portal he figures out far too much about it too quickly the characters also discuss the philosophical ramifications of the portal in a very hamhanded way in both cases it seemed that kaufman felt viewers wouldnt understand the visual symbolism and needed the ideas spelled out in detail although he may have just been poking fun at film critics some of the scenes are visionary and hilarious craigs puppet shows malkovich entering his own brain the trip through his subconscious but many others fall flat the result is a mixed bag the saving grace is the brilliant performance by malkovich himself his good natured selfdeprecation and his ability to play several wildly different characters make the movie work i was also impressed with cameron diaz who proved that when freed from the constraints of beauty and bad scripts she can be a good actress i was not as impressed with catherine keener as most critics were her part was wellwritten but she wasnt terribly convincing in the end this is a good 710 movie that gets an extra point for its spectacular creativity spike jonze shows the potential to be a truly great director but he isnt quite there yet,black_comedy
this is certainly the most weird and some times confusing movie ive ever seen however its a great film because of its extremely original plot but lets just say if i ever had the idea of writing this script i would never imagine it would make it to hollywood i must admit i was somewhat disappointed as i was expecting a lot more from this overrated movie the lesbianism involved in the movie was developed to a point in which it destroys the creative main plot of someone being inside john malkovichs head the fictitious environment lead by orson bean is very well unfolded in the end which added a lot to this movie finally this is a worth watching movie for it will play with your imagination and it will certainly be remembered rating 8510,black_comedy
spike jonzes first film is brilliant and funny and any future film he makes will hopefully be as good  the movie runs quickly and beautifully throughout as all the characters give awesome and at times hilarious performances  i especially liked orson bean as cusaks boss  a great movie,black_comedy
this film reminded me of the old twilight zone tv show that rod serling created especially the comic episodes  it has a bizarre premise witty dialogue interesting plot twists and superb acting by topnotch actors  unfortunately missing is rod serling the key to the artistic success of the aforementioned tv show  there is a meanspirited quality that overtakes the film once the premise is set up  it is still worth seeing for the uniqueness and fine acting however   it was nice to see orson bean on screen again,black_comedy
this movie was like a collage you made when you were ten years old  there were many creative pictures layed out to make you think but when you look back its just cp  well acted by all involved especially malkovich but all the ideas failed to capture my interest  the characters changed so abruptly that it seemed out of place  probably the worst movie of the year that all the critics will love,black_comedy
as i left the cinema i felt as if were drunk although i did not drink anything in this confusing movie fantasy is  strongly mixed with reality in a manner that you dont know who was actually playing at the end of it my friends and i were unable to convince ourselves that john malkovich himself was playing i liked especially the scenes of  the subconscious of jm not only him but all main actors played their roles in an excellent manner the hand held camera and realistic photography contributed strongly to the confusion it is as well a funny movie as good made i recommend watching this movie especially in the cinema because it helps you slide inside this fascinating bizarre atmosphere,black_comedy
the basic premise is great but wasted in my opinion malkovich is a great subject for such a premise but the plot revolves around sex jealousy and manipulation rather than any of a host of other elements that would have been more compelling and made full use of the potential of the premise other than malovich the characters come off as very shallow and empty i was impressed with the puppetry scenes which surprised me with their artistry there are some great quirky elements of the film and the brief appearances by charlie sheen are very funny this is a film worth watching but i feel it is definitely not one of the greatest filmes of all time dont go in with the expectation of being amazed by what some feel is true greatness and you will probably enjoy the film personally i only give it a 67 out of 10 too bad with a bit more imagination it could have been brilliant,black_comedy
this movie is probably one of the strangest and weridest movies i have seen but it was so good and original it keeps you hooked onto the movie it is about a failed puppeter who finds a porthole into the famous john malkovichs head this is a must see movie for its originality and its good acting from john cusack cameron diaz catherine keener and john malovich himself i love this movie and it should be watched by everyone,black_comedy
there are simply not enough superlatives in the english language to describe this film it is however the best film i saw in the 90s right up there with shawshank redemption fight club and the handful of other movies which fit into that all too small subsection of 90s culture this film was not even given a general release in the uk because to quote my local cinema manager its too arty he was wrong it is a piece of art but above all it is a piece of classic cinema which can be understood and appreciated by anyone with a brain perhaps people round here are too stupid the cinema owners of the uk certainly are ive been a fan of spike jonze ever since he directed the video to buddy holly by weezer was a perfect choice of script for his first feature film and while i still havent seen american beauty if you can believe that its going to have to be mighty impressive to beat jonzes first film to describe being jm as quirky and off the wall does not do it justice in an age lacking originality here i believe we have rediscovered some of that precious commodity we have no obvious hero no good people only greedy self serving people art reflecting life perhaps perhaps not but this film will truly appeal to the cynical generation weened on a diet of cash and superficiality who are seeking just a little more the eighties kids we have no culture no great defining moment in our lives our idea of nostalgia is to talk about 70s kids tv programmes is not a great defining moment it is not the beatles on ed sullivans show or the end of the second world war but at least it gives us something to think about and something better to talk about than the banana splits and bagpuss,black_comedy
lilliputian and dreamy atmospheres introduce the spectator into the marionettes world of craig john cusack meanwhile the story gets complex and the dream to manage people like puppets is confirmed for a moment the incapacity of communication is filtered and overcome by misusing somebody elses body it has reminded me in a different way the very essential message of cyrano de bergerac having found a tunnel a passage which ferries into the head of john malkovich gives an immediate benefit to succeed in love with the woman of your dreams but this passage could be also used with a sort of sexual ambiguity by the wifelotte cameron diaz misusing once again john malkovichs body the wrong ferrying process could bring to very disappointing effects like being trapped in an undesired body or searching into the private unconscious of john malkovich but the very essential of this brilliant and very original film is how to get the immortality using by time to time a different body container john malkovich is majestic spize jonze has done a demential and absurd but original and clever superb film at the end the only question to ask is are all of us puppets or puppeteer rating 7,black_comedy
i was really looking forward to seeing this movie from what i had heard it seemed that it was very funnywell it was very funny although the movies weirdness seemed at times to be a bit forced as if it were being weird just for weirdness sake  i wont get into details about the movie partly because i dont want to spoil it for anyone and partly because its too weirdly convoluted  but as much as i laughed especially at the beginning and as much as i really wanted to enjoy this movie i came away from it feeling strangely hollowwhat really turned me off is that all the characters including sadly cameron diaz who i really wanted to like turned out to be such jerks im talking no core moral values here  no mercy  no pity  no looking out for the other guy  i mean it there was not one person in this movie who had any ultimately redeeming characteristicsmaybe that was the real message of the movie  that people are at heart conniving backstabbing bstards and youre best off not trusting anyone if so this movie did its job superbly,black_comedy
spike jonze brings to the plate something like never seen before its wild imaginative weird funny and inspiring all at the same time john cusack stars as a struggling puppeteer who needs his job to support his family it includes his wife a scruffy looking cameron diaz a bevy of animals ranging from an ape to birds and everything in between he finds a job on the 7 12 floor yes you heard me right of a large industrial building the floor was built for people of the smaller stature so every has to almost walk on their knees to get around catherine keener comes in as cusacks addiction shes annoying selfish voluptuous and you cant help but like her one day working cusack find a small door which eventually leads into john malkovichs head for only fifteen minutes what follows is one of the wildest rides imaginable the camera shots are inventive the look and feel is very dark and dirty and the way everything comes at you will leave you speechless every performance is done to perfection and jonzes direction is great is like no other film before it its wild weird and if you think youve seen anything like this before you havent nothing in your wildest dreams could compare to,black_comedy
should you think that all the stories have been told check out this film proof that hollywood can produce brilliantly original works  the dance of despair and disillusionment is at once stunning art and wicked satire well if its charity yere after begone with ye ye foul demon  how unpolitically correct can you get  i recommend the dvd for the additional material,black_comedy
this is a great movie it has been far too long since such an outstanding movie  has been made the entire premise is absurd and compelling cameron diaz is particularly charming john malkovich frolics through his own lifestars and thumbs galore,black_comedy
once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow that was down along the road met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo    if you sense any resonance from reading the above words it is very likely that youll like but even if the above makes absolutely no sense to you theres still a good chance youll like the filmthe idea of shared andor exchanged consciousness is not new  i have no idea how far back it goes in literature my degree being not in literature but in biochemistry from case western reserve university in cleveland ohio so i cracked up very early in the film when dr lester remarks that floris has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from case western  no such degree program exists currently in the past few decades i can think of a few star trek episodes that dealt with the situation and a short story human is by philip k dickim sure there were a lot of little quips in the film that had either multiple meanings or just single ones that slipped me by the film was so whimsical that there were very few times that the general good humor was overwhelmed by the more serious incidents the 7 12th floor concept had the audience i was in chuckling for an enormous period of timebut the frivolity is underlaid with some interesting philosophical concepts which craig john cusack mentions several times in the film while its no doubt possible to see the film have a good time and forget about it it could also be a good film to see with friends and discuss for some timeits always interesting for me to go into a film not knowing who the actors are and seeing whether i recognize them or not i only knew malkovich was in this film i didnt recognize cameron diaz and a number of other people which is a testament either to my lack of perception andor the superlative acting andor makeup departments all in all a most delightful film which i wouldnt mind seeing again,black_comedy
   3 out of 5being john malkovichdirected by spike jonze 2000absurd frenetic and initially interesting mix of barton fink and brazil but lacking the humorous depth of the coen brothers and the visual poetry of terry gilliam talks about identity gender soul and creativity and is content to conclude that consciousness is a curse under which we all try to exist an inventive idea and good choice of host but a selflabelled intellectual comedy must never be this overlong and pretentious after the first few portal trips screenwriter charlie kaufman goes on automatic pilot the built up love triangle never heats up cameron diaz starts to struggle in her bombedout wig and our intriguing and kafkalike main character of craig schwartz john cusack seems somewhat lost not without moments though a chase through malkovichs subconscious and a flashback as seen through the eyes of a tame chimpanzee are major highlights much hyped catherine keener is too distant in her role as the office vamp  shes unassuming without any subtlety while malkovich himself seems inspired and very thrilled to be in on the joke ironically one of his finest and most reflective performances to dateandy warhol once said that everybody gets fifteen minutes of fame and maybe these words spawned it all maybe not filmmaker spike jonze who starred in three kings is heavy on artsy swagger and good at it too but would have been an instant classic as a taut twilight zone episode instead,black_comedy
the brilliance of this movie was its insight into human nature the pain of this movie was its insight into human nature  the basic concept of stepping out of our lives and into someone elses alone is just wonderful  women or men get to enjoy the feeling of experiencing an alternate sexuality feeling thin if you are large feeling important if you are dull  the portal that takes people there is the key to the movie  the film really also serves as an exploration of what we do as people surfing the web interacting as whoever we want to be  the fact that the author chose john malkovich is also interesting  a brilliant actor but a surly and intense man jm is not a pretty boy actor not a vacuous treat williams type but a character actor  one who will play a killer a psycho or whatever challenging role comes along  the reality is that even for the gristly malkovich ordering towels over the phone is fun and games for some one looking through his eyes  the sexual chemistry of having sex as someone else with someone else also gets a little weird and interesting  it made the sexual partners straight gay there and yet voyeur all at once the twists and turns are really endless,black_comedy
something lures me to ridiculous movies even though most of them turn out to be bad movies  not this one  john malkovich also starred in another ridiculous movie called conair  what makes these movies work is that they know they are ridiculous and do little to deny it and thats the keynow that doesnt give filmmakers the liberty to go willynilly to quote the free inet guy with senseless mindnumbing drivel  but it does grant them imagination and the opportunity to go where other movies have never gone before to quote whoever said thati like how even though the cusack character must have some kind of sick mind to perform sexual maneuvers with puppets in front of little girls we still get to see things from his point of view and he is as flabbergasted as we are  take for instance  when he accepts a job that is located on the 7 12 floor  how on earth do you get there  you hit the emergency stop button shortly after you go past the 7th floor and then pry open the door with a crowbar of courseit turns out to be disasterous to john malkovich that a puppeteer of all people is the one to find a portal to his brain  but thats where all the fun starts and the film never stops giving you surprises and twists  ive seen some movies that are funny and smart but this may be the first one thats funny and brillianti only wish that cameron diaz had put one of her pets down the chute that wouldve really put the filmmakers imaginations on overtime out of 4,black_comedy
not since blair witch have i seen a small film get so much hype ill be the first to agree that this film is original  is it a masterpiece  no  its a strange film and in the right critics circle weird means its art and to hell with qualitymalkovich is one of those films that doesnt know what it wants to be its okay if you want youre film to have different genres in it but when it seems like the movie is becoming something else every 30 minutes you know youve got problemsin my opinion the film should have just stuck to being a fable about a lowly pupeteer  the puppet sequences are the best parts of the film  this film tries to bring some sort of message about self identity but gets drunk along the way and goes off rampwhat kind of ending was that ,black_comedy
this is definitely a must see movie simply because it is so unlike anything else out there outside of saying that there really isnt much more to say since its very hard to explain without the person youre explaining it to thinking youve set up shop in crazyland any summary of the plot does not do justice to the movie its original and creative to say the very least im not too sure how good it is partly because its so weird its hard to judge i do think there are some parts which dont work and that if i see this movie again with an understanding of whats going on i may lower my opinion of it but its definitely a movie you have to see once,black_comedy
this movie examines who we are am i still me if you are in my head are you still you if i am in your head who is youwith questions like these you might expect that bjm is a deep movie plumbing the dark recesses of the cosmos not really true it is a comedy that bends the lines between genders and species it plays havoc with the truths of existence and the sanctity of the human soul it even bends the mortality of man into something like practical incarnation yet its funnydisturbing yet hilarious what would happen if someone could enter a portal into their own head the answer the movie provides is both gutwrenchingly funny and bizarre the small door that serves as a portal to john malkovichs head is similar to the rabbit hole in lewis carrols through the looking glass a portal to a strange new universe a universe right behind your eyes who knows what lurks in the soul of man bjm knows deep laughter,black_comedy
there are about a million comments here explaining what the plot of this movie is about so ill just cut straight to my pointuses some sharp and original wit to ease the audience into deep notions of the nature of the human mind and the psyche of the entertainer an actor especially a method actor is in the business of assuming identities  letting fictional identities into their own head  this film shows us a world where this method is taken to the extreme and real people can actually get inside malkovichs head  it ponders what affect these people might have on the actors mind and in turn how the experience affects each of these peopleschwartz john cusack might learn to control john malkovich but how much of john malkovich seeps into schwartzs mind in the processwas lotti cameron diaz originally transexual or was this a misinterpreted response to unfamiliar male emotionswhat happens to john malkovich when he is pushed out of his own mind does he regress into the subconscious and if so is he really totally ineffectual thereif the portal represents the subconscious then we are faced with questions regarding the nature of the mind and just how the psychological prying that is a part of everyday life tv conversations music might alter the development of the individual  actors by trade assumably are sensitive to external mental symbolism and suggestion so this film could be an analogy for the effect of the media impositions and social idolising of any actorthe only flaws are a hyperactive fragmented plot structure  but this is also one of its good points so go figure  a fairly predictable ending i guess they needed funding  and an eventual ignorance of the fate of malkovichthis is an intensely philosophicalpsychological tragedy masked by a surreal and absurd sense of irony  if you didnt like this movie you were probably expecting either just a pisstake or a tome of knowledge  take it for what it is  whatever that is,black_comedy
what can i say an original weird and funny comedy all the characters that seem to be innocent and nice turn out to be evil and selfserving all of them the only good people in this movie are charlie sheen and malkovich himself thats probably the best thing about the movie  i would have liked to see the chimp go inside the portal but thats the only thing i would have changed brilliant if you havent seen it go see it,black_comedy
well um let me try to put this in the most honest and brutal way i can possibly be i havent seen a movie this good for a very very very long time and this was the funniest film i have seen in a very very very very long timeok what the hell was the sixth sense doing among the best pic nominee sixth sense was not one of the best pictures of year 1999 i have seen all of the best picture nominated films and american beauty was the only one that really belonged there and on the side of it as well alright ill get on with my review if you dont already know is about a puppeteerjohn cusack who discovers a portal that puts the person into john malkovichs head the story is hilarious and very original from the start to finish it also gives the viewers something to really think about underneath its skin ever wanted to be someone else from the obsessed puppeteer craig his petobsessed wife the skanky and cocky maxine to the dirty old dr lester fits in pefectly and works wonderfully to make a charming and hilarious pictureoriginal and striking direction by spike jonze and carter burwells music worked beautifully together spike jonze whos making his directoral debut with achieved an excellent job and i hope to see more from him the last partnot the very very ending seemed a little farfetchedi wont reveal what happens just for the sake of the people who havent seen this film but it was still very enjoyablewell looking for something original and funny and smart well here it is i give  out of ,black_comedy
i went into this movie expecting it to be strange and offthewall  i was not disappointed  charlie kaufmans writing was brilliant as was spike jonzes direction  this movie makes you believe in the next generation of directors and leaves many of todays great directors in the dust,black_comedy
i was expecting to love this movie as almost all the reviews i read for it were positive but overall i felt it was such a wonderous idea held back by a dark and dreary look as well as unlikeable characters i cant stand it when a movie presents you with a protagonist that you start out rooting for before the screenplay turns him into a jerk as for the story i certinly got its meaning and did laugh a few times maybe even gary sinese but after it was over i just feltwell depressed i guess imagination can do that to you,black_comedy
i was aware of bjm when it came out and i heard lots of good things about it original unholywood all the good stuff  didnt have a chance to see it though then came i guess the backlash   too smart  being an easily influenced person i lost interest in the movie then a filmmaker friend of mine a person whom appreciates similar things in film as me called me up from hong kong because he saw it at a festival there and told me twas mustsee whattheheck so i rented it tonight saw it on my sick bed engaged during the whole trip amused at times  astonished at times amazed at times  definitely some very cool stuff going on there  the first fifteen minutes was pure genius the dialogue was right on so everyday life so effortless and says so much about the characters the dynamics between the characters  wella few hours later which is now i think back there was quite a stretch of the material in the film it was an interesting premise but it seems the filmmakers are trying too hard to connect the premise with greater meaning  but it didnt work at least for me felt contrived tried too hard  its a lot of plot for not a lot of substance  kind of like this comment  sorry for your time,black_comedy
having seen at a yale film society screening while visiting a friend i can say that i am looking at one of this years best picture nominees if it with american beauty and fight club make the best picture list the 2000 oscars may be known as the year of the surrealist attacks upon commercial society is not as visually surreal as one would initially assume it to be but its plot is warped and twisted enough to require near linear cinematography in it a disgruntled and unemployed puppeteer who takes a whitecollar job to please his wife discovers a portal into the mind of the actor john malkovich the meditations upon the meaning of fame viewpoint relationships in and outside the sphere of normality and the new jersey turnpike are handled with a veneer of black humor which lies finely over the mindblowing and exciting ideas that these concepts raise all of the ambiguities are classically handled by the sublime performances of the leads in especially john cusack whose tall frame provides one of the most engaging sight gags in the whole film as his office is on the 7 12 floor where he has to stoop low overhead cameron diaz charlie sheen and catherine keener also coming off a good performance in 8mm one of the few saving graces of that film are all also excellent and john malkovich may get a best supporting nod just for his rendition of what going through ones own portal is like the short summary remains see go with a friend talk about the movie talk about life wander for a bit when it really hits you sit down then see it again,black_comedy
i have to admit that when i first saw in the movie theatrei didnt know what to think of it it was one of the weirdest movies i had ever seen so unhollywoodyet having big name hollywood stars in itsuch as john cusack and cameron diaz and of course john malkovich it wasnt until i saw it again recently on dvd that i realized what a really great movie this isbecause it is so unhollywood the characters in the movie are complexyet so funny and likeable at the same time you sympathize with themno matter how desperate or unreasonable they may become it is a very avantgard moviebut without being too artsy or annoying cameron diaz proves that she is not just another actress turned model with a pretty facebut that she actually has real talent and can act the always cool john cusack proves to the audience again that he is one of the most versatile actors in hollywood and katherine keener does indeed give an oscar worthy performance as the ambitious machiavellian gorgeous coworkerwho acts as the catalyst in the movie it is so refreshing to see a movie that does no t follow the standard hollywood formula of predictability spike jonze truly deserved the nomination for best director and i think it is a travesty that this movie was not given at the very least a best picture oscar nomination but the cider house rules was i think it was a great movie and i highly recommend it,black_comedy
ill bet the reason i got nauseous while watching this film was because i was enjoying it so much waitits all becoming clear now the reason i hold those jackals in hollywood in such contempt is because im not blessed with their understanding and compassion lord let us not ever forget their compassion im ashamed to admitbut it needs to be said so that i may be whole againthat i thought bjm might be about destroying gender identity and attacking morality at least mine while offering a complete new set of values just discovered in hollywood you seeand my shame here is greati thought hollywood was filled with amoral whores who would eat their own young on a dareor even a suggestion  repent ye sinners there is a better world ahead hollywood is working on it even now  therenow i feel wholebut very empty,black_comedy
warning spoiler comments throughout dont read further if you havent seen the moviesome aspects of this movie i found very amusing such as the basic premise a portal into someone elses life and especially the 7 12 floor very cute much of the latter half of the movie seemed to lose focus and spread itself very thinly over the characters i was uncomfortable with the whole girlgirl relationship come on hollywood do we need more twisted stuff like this in movies i think notone of the major problems i have with this movie is that none of the characters are likeable save for john m himself who appears only briefly as himself i didnt care for the john cusak sp character nor either of the women,black_comedy
art film is dead  that may seem a funny way to introduce a positive review of bjm but the cleverness and skill of this film are painful reminders that as good as this is this is really the best it can get anymore  and the best it can get is really not very goodtwenty years ago this sort of thing would have been considered a particularly original hollywood screwball comedy or weird scifi film kind of like one of terry gilliams outings but it aint an art film and i dont know that ive really seen an art film anywhere about anything for yearswhat is an art film  last year at marienbad was an art film picnic at hanging rock was an art film  fitzcarraldo was an art film  walkabout was an art film  aguirre the wrath of god was an art filmthese were original serious and thoughtprovoking filmsarguably bjm is original serious and thought provoking in technique even in plot but really nothing about it is terribly original in concept  the themes are actually pretty hackneyed stardom our obsessions with stardom the nature of individuality the differences between men and women etc ho hum  how many times have we rehashed those beforethere are no grand themes anymore  everything is irony and cynicism irony and cynicism  arrrgh  doesnt anyone have anything challenging to say  ill even take pretentious just once id like to see an art film that wasnt1 a variation on a tried and true hollywood format central station2 a naive simplistic film about emotions children of heaven3 a popculture posthuman selfsatisfied genx feature anything by that tarrantino monster4 technically innovative but intellectually vapid blair witch projectis there a director out there who has the cajones to be an intellectual hello anybody,black_comedy
what more can i say than fantastically bizarrenot that cameran diaz looking so drab most men wouldnt look twice at her is by any way the most strange and bizarre thing about this movie but it proves the director had a great sense of humoryou know a movie is a little diferent from most when the monkey get the flash back scenewonderfull in every way,black_comedy
i just saw and its a remarkable movie i never thought that hollywood would have the cojones to realize such an outraging project but i guess its not possible to learn how malkovich sees and feels things and people you only can learn what he sees and feels you stay yourself no one of his visitors is malkovich  except perhaps kusack but the real malkovich fights the occupation a rather intricate metaphysical or metapsychical question however  an awesome film worth to see it two times,black_comedy
if you loved braveheart lethal weapon theres something about mary office space or die hard then this movie is probably not for you  i dont care what most of the voters thinkthis movie is far out and best watched when youre drunk or high  a few good oneliners and an original concept is mostly all i found enjoyable about this flick  i could never figure out whether its a comedy a dark comedy or just dark  i gave it 4 of 10,black_comedy
this movie is so absurd and so way out there that it will be either hated or loved there cannot be an inbetween  in one of his reviews roger ebert noted that many films nowadays display for the viewer some sort of new novelty that will shock or amaze  think of the zipper scene in something about mary the audience  is an experience that takes this premise to a whole new leveli noticed that the film borrows many themes and ideas from terry gilliams film brazil  most interesting to me was the feeling that the director wanted you to fall in love with a particular character only to twist the story and make you hate them  in the beginning i sympathized with craig the stereotypical loser with a soft side for art who later turns out to be a greedy jerk  then there was his neglected unattractive wife lotte whose personality is revealed to be nothing more than sexdriven and stabs her husbands back  so goes the movie as it was in brazil when every character is later revealed to have an obnoxious repelling side that drives us to another character to seek comfort in perhaps to put our faith into as the protagonist that will lead us through the filmhonestly the beginning led me to believe that craig would undergo some transformation that would fulfill his dreams make him a winner  having this bubble bursted was somehow disconcerting uncomfortable yet utterly ingeniousthe movie is mad it runs at a frenetic pace with very strange logic  much of it seems deja vu as if ive seen it somewhere else before yet it is done so well it comes off as original brilliant   and it is10 out of 10,black_comedy
the most creative movie i have ever seen i wont bother summarizing because it wouldnt even begin to do the film justice all i can say is that i was so mesmerized by the concept and the performances that the film could have been 45 hours of john malkovich brushing his teeth and i still would have been weeping uncontrollably if you want to indulge your fascinations and get lost in a wild creative ride see this movie i only wish i had thought of the idea first but i probably would have come up with something much less interesting like being bob saget no offense i think i saw every episode of full house anyway this movie is certainly a must see and will captivate your imagination well after youve left the theatre if nothing at all its a blast to sit through,black_comedy
note this comment does not include spoilers for the movie it does however contain spoilers for the screenplay which is available on the internet these spoilers do not give away details of this movie as it can be seen in theaters in this comment i dont want to talk much about the movie itself it is as you can see from my oneline summary above excellent im a big fan of the theater of the absurd beckett ionesco etc and is the cinematic theater of the absurd great funny and remarkably clever in every second but to come to my point i read the screenplay not the filmed version as i found out now in advance it literally had me rolling on the floor laughing and afterwards it had me considering the genius of mr charlie kaufman in utter admiration of his talents so now having seen the movie i am a bit disappointed to see that the fantastic original ending which had the malkovichians take control of the entire planet and turn it into an orwelllike dystopia lotte diaz who in the beginning was probably the most bizarre character in the story becomes the only remaining recognizable human being on earth who wants to stage a revolution against the terror regime of the malkovichians while craig cusack becomes a puppet himself in the hands of evil oh and by the way lotte marries the monkey was replaced by a less favorable ending but i guess budget considerations were the reason for this decision pity nonetheless this film is maybe the most mindwrenching funny and clever comedy ever to grace the screens i think cameron diaz is the heart and soul of it in her best performance yet she should have been the one getting an oscar nomination but still if you ever have the chance to catch the screenplay on the net read it it will enhance your appreciation for this masterpiece even more and youll see what a shame it is that such great projects like this one dont get enough money to transport the writers vision to the screen as it was meant to i give this movie a straight 10 points,black_comedy
i found myself often dumbfounded during not because i did not enjoy the film rather i could not believe hollywood actually produced this wonderfully innovated and creative scripti have little to say about the film since it speaks for itself and is quite indescribable  just see it  there is nothing else like it on the video shelf,black_comedy
i thoroughly enjoyed this fantastic tale that is altogether believable the acting and writing are enough that the premise behind the movies title almost plays second fiddle is only the beginning for these sorry charactersthis film reminds me of many of the postmodern short stories published in the 2nd half of the 20th centurysomething extraordinary happens and while the characters find it amazing they are never found in disbeliefthe three main actors cusak diaz and keener are great and actually overshadow malkoid rather let the details speak for themselves so dont hesitate to check this movie out,black_comedy
spike jonze is either a genius or a psycho for this incredible sickening film a lot of credit also goes to charlie kaufman as well i can compare this film to terry gilliams fear and loathing in las vegas in that these were the only two movies where i sat up and asked myself what the heck is going on an absolutely fantastic film although unconventional i dont think it qualifies as an art film not laughoutloud hilarious but the kind of witty humor that i enjoy    the movie is worth for its sheer originality including my favorite scene when john malkovich becomes john malkovich it is simply magnificent jonze does a brilliant directing job here although i wouldve liked to see something more unique and unconventional to fit the story of the movie see three kings which jonze did a great acting job in malkovich is always a pleasure to watch as is john cusack cameron diaz seems a little out of place for some reason but catherine keener does a great joba very strong 910 which means if you can survive the ride and can get passed the weird story this film is well worth it,black_comedy
so the title that stuck out like the proverbial battered thumb since preproduction has finally reached our screens and the good news is the title is probably the least inventive thing on display hereis the bastard offspring of monty python absurdist comedy but with the bowler hat replaced by a witches cape the darkness of this movie comes from many sources the freaky puppetry cameron diazs wig but above all the utter immorality of virtually every single character in fact in a neat subversion of the old hollywood is mad assumption the only one resembling anything near normality in the world of this picture is old slaphead himselfnevertheless this is an undeniable and unforgettable masterpiece from hollywoods latest prodigy youll laugh like a drain gape with shock and leave the cinema more than a little disturbed just make sure you leave your sense of reality at the door after all this is a world where absolutely noone shows any disbelief whatsoever not even for a moment at there being a portal to john malkovichs brain,black_comedy
i dont think is a great film but it did deserve the best original screenplay award far more than american beauty  there are flaws to the film many non sequiturs and overloads on plot threads however spike jonzes debut is essentially an ingenious look at being obsessed and infatuated whether with celebrity sex or the idea of eternal life  the truth is all three have their flaws and their mediocrity just like us  the film has sparks of brilliance does anybody recognize exactly where on the tpk they filmed it  of course its a perfect endpoint because on the new jersey turnpike youre either in such a rush or so bored by the lack of scenery that you dont bother to look left or right to see people falling from the sky  besides that for the next week i will recall with a giggle a scene of a restaurant full of baldheaded men and women reading from menus of malkovich malkovich malkovich   the characters here are almost all pathetic yet at the same time i didnt get a sense of sarcasm on jonzes part as with anderson in boogie nights  here they were simply deeply flawed people  it was tragic to see how cusack replicated his sadsack self within the body of malkovich even while able to bring his puppetry to new heights  diaz was a real revelation here playing totally against type believable in all her goofy nerdiness though she is known for much sexier roles  keener also great in living in oblivion was great to watch here though an absolute cow    i would rather see charlie kaufman and spike jonzes work anytime than something that purports to be high art and preaches to the audience instead of entertaining it  establishes itself as and remains for the most part a rewarding goofy comedy with some tender moments and food for our heads at the end  even if we could leave our own bodies for the mind of john malkovich we wouldnt be able to escape who we are  so why try,black_comedy
as a first feature film this movie was amazing  the acting was also outstanding however this film left me in such a bad mood after it was done and i have figured out why  the characters that those wonderful actors especially ms keener played were heinous weak people  though they were funny for awhile i eventually had to stop laughing because i felt like i was laughing at the fat kids in school i will watch it again so please dont take this as a criticism but was it ever dark,black_comedy
i have rarely if ever seen such an original film as this populated throughout by quirky original oddball characters everyone in a superb ensemble cast played against type in a thoroughly enjoyable truly hilarious mind blowing surreal experience brilliant,black_comedy
easily the most delicious film to light up the screen in years  this is that rare idea that only sees the light of day through some wonderful collision of good luck chance and smiling gods  the malkovich restaurant scene is without argument one of the  funniest and most original episodes in movie history,black_comedy
after having this recommended to me by a friend i had high hopes for it and was not disappointed a hard film to pigeonhole as it has elements of most genres this film is loosely about a frustrated puppeteer craig who after much badgering from his wife gets a proper job as an office clerk in the 7 12 floor of an office where he discovers a portal to yes youve guessed it john malkovichs brain where he can see what john sees things start to get out of hand when he starts selling tickets and soon craigs wife a fellow employee and john himself get involved it this crazy and inspired film go see it,black_comedy
i was amazed i couldnt believe how original how funny and how smart this film was the performances are astounding i cant wait until the directors and the writers next project i cant say anything else about this film because there is no way to describe it i loved it,black_comedy
weird  deep  if thats what you like in films youll enjoy this one if not you might as well stop reading nowfrom 1sttime director spike jonze whose work up until now has been as a director of pop videos  coproduced by rems michael stipes this is a film which is highly original  hard to classifycraig john cusack is a puppeteer with a habit of living out his fantasies with puppets made to look like people in his life unhappily married to frumpy lotte cameron diaz as youve never seen her before he is desperately  unsuccessfully trying to have an office affair with sassy hardnosed maxine catherine keenerwhile looking for a dropped file at work he stumbles across a womblike tunnel that turns out to be a portal into the mind of john malkovich who plays himself this enables him to experience everything malkovich does for 15 minutes before being dumped beside the new jersey turnpike when lotte tries it she decides shes really a man trapped in a womans body or something  also takes a shine to maxine maxine fancies lotte too  but only when lotte is meanwhile craig discovers he is able to control malkovich from inside the way he does his puppets  when malkovich himself gets involved things really start to get strangethis is definitely an ideas movie  designed to make you think as much as to entertain we thought it was largely about identity how we define who we are through others  lovers spouses children celebrities  even to the extent of vicariously living our lives through them  about how we can mercilessly manipulate the people in our lives to meet our own needs these are however only theoriesdespite being somewhat hard to follow  a bit silly in places i enjoyed this film  its intelligent thought provoking  actually very funny but it is weird,black_comedy
if ever you grow weary of the movies is the perfect antidote to get you excited about film again  spike jonze has created one of the most amazingly original surprising and uniquely hilarious movies to come along in a long long timethe performances given by the entire cast is remarkable as you truly do forget that these are not real people despite the fantastic events taking place  nearly every shot brims with jonzes desire to show us something weve not seen before  i often found myself grinning uncontrollably at what we are being shown and there lurks a genuine surprise behind every cornerthe end begins to get a bit muddled but multiple viewings are certainly rewarded as you notice more beautiful quirky details  the ending twist is certainly satisfying once you catch it1999 should be remembered as the year of the rookie director mendes russell shymalan etc and spike jonze should be honored right alongside them  goes beyond being simply an odd artsy film it exemplifies what great cinema can be with a little effort at originality,black_comedy
and there you were thinking that hollywood never really steps out of the box these days and does something that isnt formula or dictated by preview audienceshow then do you account for this one of the damnedest things to be ever perpetrated on filmeven the very title alerts you to the fact that youre about to board the train for weirdsvillewith a cast featuring performers in surprising places diaz all but unrecognisable in a fright wig as the frumpish wife keener as the aggressive vamp the greatest surprise in a film that constantly trades in them is malkovich himself hell who else is going to play himhes having a ball playing a pompous actor who gets well and truly shaken up especially when he goes through his own portalconfused dont be watch this film and like the characters find yourself taken to weird places youd never thought youd ever go to,black_comedy
this film has the most paranoid psychedelic story ive seen in ages its surrealism makes monty python or even bunuel look like the most reasonable of all people it is said that bjm is a metaphore about our urge to become someone else i dont know about that but it is surely a film that takes you to a trip you never want to end and after making a series of small masterpieces in music videos jonze makes surely the most spectacular feature debut of the year along with sam mendes of course oh yes and the most original menage a trois or a quatreone could ever hope for,black_comedy
this is a unique and original film to watch and not like many others john cusack is good as craig schwartz a struggling puppeteer who gets a job on the seven and a half floor of an office building and discovers a portal to access actor john malkovich cameron diaz plays his wife lotte and catherine keener is good as his coworker maxine they decide to charge people two hundred dollars for the pleasure of visiting mr malkovich but he soon finds out and the scene when he himself goes through the portal is amazing and the best scene in the film the scenes when craig and lotte are inside malkovich reminded me slightly of the final segment of woody allens everything you wanted to know about sexbut were afraid to ask when a group of people are inside a mans body controlling him and also the movies fantastic voyage and innerspace came to mind also but this is far better than those films john malkovich is also good playing himself with a soft spoken voice bizarre funny different its nice to see that some original and worthwhile films do appear every now and then watch it again and again,black_comedy
this wasby farthe worst movie i have ever seen in my 19 year life span  i had to fight myself to watch the end 40 minutes into it because i had no idea where the thing was going  the whole movie is so bad so poorly developed and with a downright stupid storyline,black_comedy
hugely creative  the writer and director reach for so much  the actors push this movie along quite well and looking back on it i remember my general expression being an openmouthed giddy stunned smile with a growing confidence that nobody involved in this movie was going to drop the ball while taking me places i have never been to  is to any movie you have ever seen what dali or picasso were to impressionists or realists  a quantum leap in creativity with no peers in any recent art form  it sounds like im laying it on a bit thick here but i have never been this blown away by any artists vision,black_comedy
i couldnt wait for this movie to end thats how boring it was when was it funny neverthe sort of absurd humor is outright stolen from such novels as catch 22which was written in the early 60s when was it original never if you have to bring in a chimp to make it funny youre really on the wrong way when was i gripped by the story or anyone of the characters never do you really think anyone will ever like this movie in ten years from now so lets quit the hype and call this movie a mediocre fairytale,black_comedy
this movie takes you along with its absurdity it is original even inspite of the fantastic screenplaydiaz is extremely funny and so is cusacktoo bad though the sharp humor is mainly set in the beginning of the movie the 7andahalfth floor the secretary with her hearingproblem that kind of decreased when the movie was continuingbut i love the movie a lot the sexscenes between madeline malkovich and diaz was the funniest i have ever seen and charlie sheens cameo was also quite amusingan 8 out of 10,black_comedy
rarely does a movie truly surprise me with its content but this one took me for a ride  i had heard nothing about it and was dragged to the theater reluctantly  but it was incredible  i have always loved john cusack and cameron diaz was hysterical  catherine keener gave a stellar performance and she wholly deserved her academy award nomination  i walked away from the theater stunned  it was truly an incredible film stemming from such a refreshingly unique screenplay,black_comedy
may be a funny film and have hilarious moments in fact that is one of the main reasons as to why it is so watchable but it is also a completely fascinating piece of filmsurely this is the peak of postmodernsim built up by tarrantino and weir truman showand finally capped off by spike jonze  an actor playing himself as an actor as an actor going inside the head of himself in a film about himself a normally glamourous hollywood star made to look frumpy and ugly fathering the child of the woman who she slept with even though they never actually slept together and the baby is john malkovichs brad pitt being on screen for a split second sean penn poking fun at himselfthis is what bowfinger could have been if it wasnt written by steve martinbrilliant,black_comedy
you get lured into this film and almost hypnotized by its off beat story quack dialogue and the strange behavior that is accepted as normal in this spike jonze film probaly up there with the top 3 movies i have seen all year you are for a treat when you commit yourself to this movie as the movie ended and the credits were rolling i felt oddly out of place because no one was getting up to leave everyone sat there silently just watching the credits for about 2 or 3 minutes when i quietly exited the theater i cast a glance back pver my shoulder expecting others to follow in exiting but only saw the back of their heads still staring at the credits on the screen bizarre great film,black_comedy
undoubtedly has some marvellous ideas but theres a frustrating incongruity of tone  the first half of the film is perfect sophisticated comedy but as craig starts to really lose it the laughs drain away to leave what is one of cinemas few philosophical horror films  the ending seemed one of the most sinister in living memory overall im left with the same disturbing feeling as i had when watching terry gilliams fear and loathing in las vegas  that if the filmmakers expected to create this sensation the film is marvellous  if however jonze intended this as a pure comedy and a great deal of reviewers seem to have taken it this way then i feel as if im dealing with people whose armour of hip cynicism has grown so thick as to rob them of all human sympathy  for their characters  still worth seeing though,black_comedy
first degree it doesnt make sense second degree it doesnt mean anything third degree it aint even funny beside why would anyone in his right mind need to point a gun at his wife when he wants to tie her and put her in a cage this part clearly escaped me furthermore if a lover tries to shoot you would you live with her right this is only a fiction it doesnt happen this way in real life does it or is it that us film producers need to put guns on screen,black_comedy
brilliant original unique funny touchingthis film should have won the screenplay oscarit was amazingly original and well craftedwhere else can you see a film that explores unrequited love longing to be someone else immortality love for the sake of love no matter who it isall of the cast is fabulousthe most perfect film that i have seen in 1999,black_comedy
being john malkovickdirection  inventive and creative needs to be seen to be believedacting  malkovick is excellent as he plays various roles including himself the other supports contribute the best they can the puppets are incredibly good at acting as welleditingspecial effects  watch when malkovick plays himself enough to give him and people viewing this enough nightmaresplot  complex and dark emotional disintegration of persona and characterstrong words and violence etc  plenty of strong words here what do you expect when people want to get into your head without permission there are also some sex scenes with three in a bed or maybe more all this will be revealed during the discourse of the filmmusic 4 you might not notice this as you try to work out what is happeningsound y does the job in providing you with a suitable atmospherehookability  when you notice things are getting smaller you must not turn away from the screenlastability  youll probably want to hang around to see how things workdont work out delete as appropriateoverall  a movie that might not be up everyones street but creative enough to be watchable,black_comedy
weird writing inspired acting unexpected cameos and the unspoken realisation that yes people really can get used to anything  this was a great great film  im sure its packed full of symbolism that i didnt get  i leave symbolism and overanalysis to the english majors  to me if a film can make me believe its a good film  if it can make me believe something utterly absurd then it becomes great,black_comedy
magnificent the script is pure genius a portal into malkovich brain  i love it john cusack looks like the big lebowski himself catherine keener is excellent diaz gives a great performance while trying to look less beautiful than usual she should have gotten an oscarnomination for this but im pretty sure shell get one within the next two years anyway if she keeps picking her roles like shes doing right now and of course theres malkovich himself who is hilarious as are the many cameos is funny very original and intelligent and its among my favorite films ever,black_comedy
i was afraid that after seeing the trailer reading a few reviews and articles about this movie that there would be few surprises and no laughs left i was happy to be wrong the trailer is just a bare hint unlike so many movies these days where the movie trailer is the movie perfect example pleasantvillethere is so much more to this movie than its premise and i wont go over that there are plenty of sources for finding out the plot of this moviewhat i want to comment on is the unoriginal comment everyones making how blindingly original this movie is i sat there while enjoying the humor and pathos of the characters and the twists and turns of its incredible plot wondering how in the world this screenplay was sold to any backers in todays hollywoodthis movie makes you think about the cruelty of fame the difficulty of acting especially with malcovich the man playing malcovich the actor playing john cusacks character sexual roles and identity and even immortalitythe acting was excellent and it is a truly funny film and can be enjoyed totally at that level,black_comedy
warning leave your brain at the door for this one    those of you who have a copy of crispin glovers 1989 album the big problem is approximately equal to the solution the solutionlet it be or are even remotely familiar with it know that it was the weirdest record ever made and for at least ten years nobody could imagine anyone from hollywood coming out with something as weird as this then came the movie which along with ace ventura pet detective1994 el mariachi1992 and welcome to the dollhouse1995 should be listed in citadel presss films of the nineties booksee my comment on ace venturapet detective for this reference  upon seeing this film its expected that many would ask why did they choose john malkovich couldnt they have chosen some other scary celebrity like christopher walken anthony james richard lynch john saxon dennis hopper or even crispin glover was mickey rourke throwing too many punches on the set did john lithgow mellow out after 3rd rock from the sun but then you realize that if they were chosen the same questions would be asked and youd get back to enjoying the film as it is like many i didnt recognize cameron diaz at first i originally thought the female lead was kyra sedgwick until i saw an announcer on entertainment tonight put this notion away for me all in all this is just an elaborate version of those public service announcements that we saw as kids trying to tell us to be ourselves instead of somebody were not but its still worth seeing looney as it may be it deserves an oscar not in spite of its weirdness but because of it,black_comedy
an incredible journey into the mind of john malkovich  it was so enjoyable we did it three times and cant wait to see it again  i only wish it had a chance to win best picture  we will be deeply sorry if it doesnt get best original screenplay  boy was it originalshalom,black_comedy
this movie is excellent there are so many original ideas crammed into it one review i read compared in to the coen brothers i can see their point but there really isnt anything remotely like it  unfortunately like other original films such as eraserhead or fear and loathing in las vegas it will be too much to handle for anyone who is put off by a lot of weirdness in movies  thats their loss though and completely deserves its oscar nominations why were malkovich and cameron diaz not nominated though,black_comedy
is a clever film with a weird concept if action flicks or love stories are your thing stay clearif you however enjoy odd concepts and quirky twists it is a very clever little flick the writer deserves credit and possibly a phsycological evaluation for turning out this idea and john malkovich himself has been very cool to take the film onfor me a 710 film as though the idea is clever it did not quite carry my enthusiasm all the way through,black_comedy
an amazingly hilarious and undeniably strange film bjm was perhaps a little too out there for academy members but it was without a doubt the best film of 99 in my book i cannot recall ever laughing harder in a cinema than i did in the scene in which malkovich enters his own portal the films ideas scenery and cast all make for an undeniably fresh look at cinema and the casting of malkovich was destiny  hes the last person youd expect to star in the comedy of the year and perhaps thats why the film works so effectively ive tried to explain this film to my friends in germany i saw the film in california while visiting in winter and  bjm wont be out here until may  yet i wish i had never tried to explain it  it cant be explained nor should it be i have also bought carter burwells scorebrilliant  i cant see why that wasnt nominated for best score  its the richest darkest and therefore most original piece of music ever set to a comedy and it adds a completely new layer to the film  i recommend this film to anyone who thought the oscar nominations were a bit thin and to anyone who is tired of cookie cutter hollywood productions that are either sequels remakes or films that seem like sequels and remakes double jeprody  green mile  youve got mail  runaway bride boiler room  why dont we just call these movies the fugitive in a dress the shawshank magic man meg and tom iii pretty woman got married and wall street jr  spike jonze obviously couldnt take anymore monotony and made bjm thank god he did,black_comedy
perhaps one of the most underrated movies ever this film is good on several levels  it carries two different tones hardly noticed by the unwatchful eye  at first glance it would appear to be a comadie but is actually a deep picture that brings upon questioning of what happiness and selfworth are the film is full of metaphors that leave it open for multiple viewingsi personally have seen this film 8 times at the theater  no one should miss this film,black_comedy
this film is original captivating fascinating and when i went to see it it completely held me from start to finish the material is very wellorganized a credit to kaufmann the screenwriter and it is an aesthetic delight the ultimate strengths are the performances themselvescusack is the definitive straight man i hope history is kind to him and that he is rewarded for his efforts in the future for his work in what i feel are some of the best films ever made catherine keener is a dynamic presence with intelligence and wit to match and i found a new respect for cameron diaz who has really established herself this year in this role among others as not just a pretty face but an intelligent diverse actress that deserves to be taken seriously it is a shame that she didnt fall among the ranks of academy nominee for her role in this film but as ive said before there are only so many spaces to fillmalkovich himself was the most impressive unfortunately we dont think about it until later even if he is portraying a version of himself this is barnone his best role to date he successfully becomes a vehicle not only for his own caricature but for that of the other characters in the film he is a genuinely gifted and brave manthe only minor complaint about this film and it is minor is that a few of the characters seem to readily accept the oddities or ramblings they are presented with or already know details about something without any evidence on the audiences part of having received them in advance an example of this is when craig cusack first tells maxine keener about the porthole and she sarcastically dismisses what is said as ramblings at least at first but a few minutes later she instigates the notion of capitalizing on it at a point where we as onlookers still believe that she thinks or should think that the door in question is a figment of craigs imagination i didnt quite buy thatnevertheless it is what it is and that is magnificent in a way it is the 2001 a space odyssey of 1999 in that it is the first of its kind i imagine that a whole slough of ripoffs and descendants will come about in the years ahead and that it has the same level of reception by the academy of motion pictures ie a nod for best directing but not best picture jonze himself deserves credit for successfully pulling this off despite this being his first film he is a artist of dynamic proportions as proven by his portfolio of music videos he is a legend in the making and malkovich is the foundation,black_comedy
a genius a genius a genius this is what spike jonze is his nomination for this years oscar as best director is more than deserved and i cant understand why this amazing film that is wasnt nominated for best picture well maybe thats because the academy is too oldfashioned but if they were they wouldnt nominate american beauty last years best in fact is 99s second best being only after american beauty on my top 10 note that i havent seen magnolia because it wasnt released in brazil yet so lets talk about the moviehave you ever wanted to be someone else what about a famous person what about john malkovich even if it lasts only 15 minutespeople can say everything they want about but conventional is the last thing it is the story about a puppeteer named craig john cusack who founds by chance in his office a portal to john malkovichs head has a wonderful surrealism the screenplay is a explosion of originality mixing delightful absurd elements with very very funny comedy and some dramathe film starts showing craigs life with his weird wife lotte cameron diaz you wont recognize her who lives with an ape named elijah which has a childhood trauma a dog lots of birds an iguana and other animals he is a puppeteer and has no job one day he finds one at the 75  floor of a building where he meets some strange people as his boss dr lester a 105 year old man and a secretary named floris who makes confusion with words his work colleague is the cold maxine catherine keener for whom he falls in love after he finds that portal to malkovichs head his life totally changes for better or worse some weird and hilarious things will happen including lesbian love and a menageatrois with two people but everything gets more complicated when john malkovich enters his own head the most hilarious scene and when craig starts to control malkovich as if he were one of his dolls thats when the film starts to show its dramatic side but it doesnt mean that malkovich is irregular yes it has a hilarious first one hour or some more and the last forty minutes are more serious if you look by a side however drama comedy and fantasy are mixed very well not resulting in a film full of gaps and skips as edtvunder a surreal story writer charlie kaufman hides important messages and morals all the characters are very well developed and the cast is just fantastic john cusack cameron diaz and john malkovich should have been nominated to the oscar but the great catherine keener was the only lucky oneso watch its the only thing i can say its weird wild funny twisted surprising unusual and totally unpredictable you shouldnt miss this one anywaya perfect 1010spike jonze is a genius,black_comedy
what would you expect from a movie in which someone finds in the seventh and a half floor of a building a kind of portal to the mind of the actor john malkovich that makes it possible for those who enter to see the world through john malkovichs eyes for fifteen minutes a lot of creativity isnt it thats it im not kidding this movie really exists and it is called and if there is one movie that we can call creative this is the oneis probably the most creative film ever made directed by the video maker spike jonze it will prove to you that being your own self is the best idea even if you ever wanted to be someone else with a brilliant and extremely original screenplay that surprises you from the beginning until the last minute of the film for example what about john malkovich or being john cusack manipulating a human being as if he were a puppet got confused watch the movie and you will ask yourself how can a person create such a creative movie you will not believe in what you will see specially if you see it through your own eyes,black_comedy
i enjoyed the first half of this film  the character of the pupeteer is interesting and the pupet scenes are very moving  i also liked floor 75 and its inhabitants and the access to the malkovich mind is engrossing at first  but then the plot development seems to lose its way  surely there is a better way to tie up this plot than the one chosen the characters are generally interesting except for that of the wife i could not see the link between the animal menagery and her ultimate lesbianism a good idea imaginatively constructed but spoiled by the ridiculous extremes to which the plot goes toward the end,black_comedy
if music video auteur spike jonzes first featurelength film is any indication this will be someone to keep an eye on  jonze is to music videos what steven spielberg is to movies  two videos in particular weezers buddy holly and sabotage by the beastie boys have become classics  holly spliced footage from happy days with weezer playing in a mockup of arnolds  sabotage was a skillful parody of 1970s police dramas a la starsky and hutch  my personal favorite though is bjorks oh so quiet which was an affectionate homage to fred astaire dance musicals  all of his videos are known for their creativity and visual flairso one would expect a lot of flair from  strangely enough not in this film  has enough chutzpah and imagination from its very strange storyjohn cusack plays a downonhisluck and facialhair covered puppeteer named craig  in any other movie that may sound like a cliche but in a hilarious opening sequence craig performs a beautiful yet highly erotic puppet show  and of course the only people watching it are a very traumatized nineyearold and her outraged father  said father then punches craig  our puppeteer hero is married to lotte an almost unrecognizable and homelylooking cameron diaz  lotte is a pet store owner who keeps most of the pets in their cramped apartment  it seems the young married couple are experiencing financial woes and cusack must go get a real job  since hes good with his fingers he gets a job as a filer in an office buildingon the 7 12 floorthings get stranger  the floor has incredibly low ceilings so everyone must spend their time hunched over  the film does a great subtle job in the weirdness  brief reactions of bemusement are given by cusack but nothing overthetop  weirdness filters in and out of life after all  why do you need to act surprised  it is on this floor that craig first lays eyes on maxine catharine keener and falls in lust with her  maxine is not impressed with our puppeteer and is even less impressed when he tells her his talent  you still play with toysthings couldnt get any worse right  but they do get weirder  as cusack is filing one day he happens across a little door behind a file cabinet curious he enters the door and finds a portal that leads into john malkovichs consciousness  yes john malkovich  otherwise the title wouldnt make much sense  the catch is that he can only spend 15 minutes in the body before being spit out on the new jersey turnpike  why new jersey why notlater he tells his wife about the metaphysical ramifications about this particular pandoras door  she tries it out anyway and finds she enjoys being a man  meanwhile cusack tells maxine about the door and she comes across a capital idea of turning in some profit from people who want to be a celebrity  that distinction is important  a great running joke of the film is that everyone knows who john malkovich is but they cant recall any of the films that he has done  everyone just wants to be someone else for fifteen minutesthings get more complicated as each member of our trio wants to use malkovich for their own means  then malkovich gets wind of the door and enters into his own consciousness  and if that aint weird enough dont worry  youll have plenty to go wha aboutkaufman has got his own brand of logic to this illogical story  there are certain subversions to classic character traits  for instance malkovich the victim comes up with the most logical idea  seal the damn door  but it lasts for only three minutes as his humane plea goes unheard  i felt sorry for malkovich the character  then there is our hero  he at first tries the door out then feels reluctant to share this information citing metaphysical inconsistencies that could prove irreparable  but when maxine begins to show interest in malkovich craig goes ahead just to be with maxine  in fact everyone in the film is suffering from some form of obsession even lotte disregards malkovichs right to exist as an individual because she wants to complete her selfactualization as a man and consummate with maxine as malkovichthat i think prevents this film from being four stars  the first thirty minutes are farce funny as it piles on layers and layers of strangeness then things take a dark turn as malkovich becomes cusacks ultimate puppet i get the sense that nothing went unheeded with detail  everything makes sense in the story nothing is weird for weirdnesss sakethe cast does an excellent job  especially john malkovich for allowing himself to be in on the joke  he seems to be having fun  cusack proves himself in another wonderful performance as a nobody schnookhero who turns into a monster keener makes a great bitch  and diaz is terrific as a homely wife who finds her happiness by pursuing masculinity in malkovichbut spike jonze provides intelligent restraint  one can almost imagine what hollywood would do with a story like this probably add some computer effects for the portal and the expending on the new jersey turnpike again the story is fantastical enough that added effects would underscore the artificiality of the film  in other words there is a nice sense of realism in the detailsi actually had a nightmare after the film in which i dreamt there was another consciousness dwelling inside me  so that must say something about what kind of effect it had on me  the scary thing about is that if there was a way for people to change their identities they probably would  the question is would they want to go back  would you,black_comedy
this might not be immediately noticeable but to me the works of robert crumb served as inspiration for the whole concept behind especially the drawing crumb called the little guy that lives inside my head one can also notice that in a certain scene john cusack buries his face in his hands in disbelief and shame  just like some drawings crumb did portraying himself in very similar situations it is also worth mentioning that robert crumb  just like john malkovich himself  is an american artist who chose to live in a small town in the south of france any comments,black_comedy
although the only truly sympathetic character in the movie is john malkovich i was entertained the 7 12 floor with hunched over office workers was a great bit everyone walking around slumpshouldered yet trying to look normal while at work hum doesnt that happen everyday flying out of a fantasy to find oneself on the shoulder of the freeway yep may happen the violence that didnt quite happen in an already lost relationship was the tensest part of movie for me but it was overall a fun time i think ill have to see this one again,black_comedy
i cannot stop talking about this movie  it is truly amazing  this is one of the most creative and original concepts that i have ever seen on screen also john malkovich is one of the few actors that would have worked in this film  the acting from malkovich and the rest of the cast is nearly perfect,black_comedy
i remember when i first heard the premise for this movie i wanted to just get up and cheer  it sounded so great a guy discovers a secret portal into the head of john malkovich allowing people to experience what it is like to be the famous but not too famous actor for 15 minutes at a clip before being dumped out onto the new jersey turnpike bizarre surreal and totally original which is why its such a shame that the movie ends up using this device in service of a rather lame romantic triangle between john cusack catherine keener and cameron diaz none of whom create a very interesting or likable character to begin with the movie could have explored the nature of celebrity or the psychological need people have to get inside someone elses head or to live vicariously through others all these things are touched on to some extent but they take a backseat to what becomes essentially a boring sex rompstill there are some wonderful things here the 7 12th floor is an invention of monty pythonesque lunacy and it provides the film with a hilarious visual motif the actual scenes of entering the portal and being inside malkovichs head are shot with great deadpan brilliance and malkovich himself is totally amazing  wonderfully droll as himself and then suitably off the wall as his body becomes overtaken by forces beyond his control he truly deserves the oscar for best supporting actor this year just think how great the acceptance speech would beof course the fact that in a movie entitled john malkovich himself could be considered only a supporting actor is entirely the problem i wanted more of him and less of the dippy trio mentioned above the movie frustrated me  it could have been so good and settled for being ordinary ultimately the things that are good about it do make it worth seeing but just barely and dont expect any comic masterpiece all the critics that hailed it as such were talking about what the film could have been not what it is rating 610,black_comedy
it is always refreshing to see surreal concepts explored in mainstream cinema particularly when they include players of the stature of john malkovich to add a certain gravitasit is helpful for any actors career to be involved in the cast of a successful movie but to be part of the title as well is a chance for immortality that noone with even a normal quota of humility could resist and what a fine casting choice is malkovich who clearly has fun in thison some levels as a movie this bizarrely conceived and executed plot does deliver many supreme moments of humour and otherworldliness but the suspension of disbelief required to absorb one completely for a full length feature will be a tough ask for many i certainly found my mind wandering at several points and wondered if i should have smoked something before seeing it to get the full effectthe puppetry scenes are superbly haunting and its almost worth seeing the film for these alone,black_comedy
most people who hear the premise smile and scratch their heads clever brilliant bizarre i went in hearing the hype and expected a good flick but was skeptical however my critical glasses crashed to the floor because i was laughing so hard it was funny ironic and idiosyncratic i expected it to be bizarre and thought provoking but i didnt expect it to be so goddamn hilarious if you breathe oxygen and have ever fantasized about leaving your body for say 15 minutes you should check this out john cusack and cameron diaz are both virtually unrecognizable and here dramatically redeemed for flaky flops theyve been in the past john malkovich is superb as expected the writing is kooky beyond belief cinematography interesting direction dead on fabulous thumbs hell all fingers toes too way up,black_comedy
this is a terrific experience  one of its many blessings is that cameron diaz is suddenly likeable  this film is totally different from anything ive ever seen before  it is great fun completely pointless rude and silly and highly recommended  john malkovich is a legend,black_comedy
talk about a different filmthis was a weirdass movie but very goodtwilight zone meets star trek a little bit of this a little bit of thatfunny bizarre and inventivei say check it outits going to be better than the cp hollywood usually puts out,black_comedy
is one of the most extraordinary films i have seen lately spike jonze proves that he is quite capable of directing a major motion picture not that it came as a surprise after his music videos the plot is just beyond belief and to big to go into great cast great story and superb film making combine into making this film a timeless classic,black_comedy
what a highly original brilliant unusual comedy  the actors and dialogue are all brilliant  if terry gilliam and rod serling did a film together this would be it  this could be a movie classic if enough people see it the puppetry both the wooden and malkovich kind are like nothing ive ever seen dont miss a second of this great wonderful sometimes creepy film  this film better not be snubbed at the oscars,black_comedy
the best thing about this movie was how much of it was left out of the commercials  a lot of studios seem to think that the only way to get you into the theater is to show you all the best parts in the advertising but when it comes down to it you dont really know that much about the plot until you actually get into the theater and that just makes the movie that much more wonderful  i dont think im giving anything away by saying that the scenes where malkovich goes inside his own head and of his subconscious are completely unexpected and absolutely wonderful  see this movie as soon as possible,black_comedy
in an age of fast cutvideocliplikefilms is a unique filmsensation clearly this is not a film everyone will like but everybody will agree that it is very different from the first scenes we are treated with an original approach to a familiar story and along the film the story elaborates with an unique sense of humor but sometimes tries to tell more than is neededjust like the big lebowski this film requires the audience to appreciate the strange sense of humor and if you do you are in for a treat of course the film has flaws made with an obvious shoestring budget some scenes are slovenly made the microphone is visible in numerous scenes and both female performances are confined by a script that focuses more on the males john cusack is brilliant as most of the times and john malkovich a serious actor is obviously delighted with this spoof characterization of himself the real problem with the film is that this one idea movie is a bit to long for its own good but all in all this is a film that everyone should go and see as a proof that original films are still being made,black_comedy
not being a big fan of john malkovich i had no desire to see this movie when it first arrived on the scene  but you know how word of mouth works i was intrigued enough after awhile to finally go  and i am so glad i did i laughed out loud in many parts  this movie is hysterically funny at times  and if i wasnt a fan of john malkovich before well i now have a keener appreciation for the man910 stars for the 712 floor,black_comedy
its good to see something different once in a while if you are looking for the standard hyped hollywood mega production you wont get it with but if you like great and weird stories youre in for a good time i prefer not talking about the story but trust me its well worth seeing it gave me the kind of feeling i had when i watched a clockwork orange to a lesser degreethe 9 puppets out of 10 are well deserved,black_comedy
what can one say about this movie other than its unique intriguing fun keeps you on edge keeps you guessing overthetop and leaves you with a gee that was different kind of feelingthis movie plunges into areas of the human psyche that one can only hope remains suppressed in every day life  theres a love triangle that i believe is a love square but isnt yet it is but its not  really get what im saying  youre never quite sure of what youre looking at  the movie simply challenges what you think about sex love and obsessionby the end of this movie i somehow felt that my brain had been oddly molested  but i liked itif youd like to see a movie whose ending you cant guess by the end of the trailer then see,black_comedy
i love this film  what a great idea  the cast is excellent and the story outrageously funny and original  and i love john malkovichs crossover acting when he is the puppeteer  its a very surreal but relatable story showing the complexity of true desires obsessions and love  its a little world unto itself which i enjoyed slipping into,black_comedy
the malkovich malkovich malkovich scene and malkovich dancing in the bedroom  both will go down in movie historyamazing puppeteering too  the opening sequence and the street corner sequence are beautiful,black_comedy
hands down i loved this movie better than any one that i have seen this year  i saw it before it came out for the first time  i went in like everybody else not knowing what it was about  i laughed until i cried from being so offronted with audacity  it was funnier than anything i saw including south park election and go  it was a brave new movie that challenged how all movies were made in generalall of the actors and actresses in this movie seemed to know what jonze was going for  they all acted psychotic and unbelievable in a movie that was psychotic and unbelievable  there is absolutely no realism to this movie nor does it ever attempt to be a realistic movie  from the surreal intro to the creepy ending this movie never strayed from way out of left field  it stayed its course and everybody who hates this be damnedi really would love to spill the beans about everything in this movie it is so wonderfulbut i cant  i cant even give away any basic plot points i went in blind and appreciated it all the more for going in blind that i do it now with all of my movies  i will go in blind except knowing about performances or genres  i almost started this paragraph spilling plot points that are basic but i deleted them  go in and be surprisedhowever i cannot recommend this movie to everybody  this is a brash movie that will shock and offend some in ways that they have not imagined  it is a black comedy darker than most  however there is no death in this movie it takes its humor from better more intellectual sources than that  but it is dark and most will hate the movie for being brash and not having many likeable characters  however the rest will love this movie for being brave brash and unlike anything weve ever experienced before10,black_comedy
is easily one of the most original films ever made its plot is twisted and difficult to explain a financially failing puppeteer craig schwartz john cusack works on the 7   floor of a building filing papers and discovers a portal to the actor john malkovichs brain  his sexy tempestuous coworker played by catherine keener is along for the ride and his wife cameron diaz is involved with both  then there is schwartzs boss orson bean who also has a special interest in malkovich  the idea behind this film is brilliant but the most fun of all comes from watching malkovich himself endure this bizarre situation the cast and the special effects are the two best features of this film and malkovich should win some type of award for being such a good sport unfortunately the story sputters a little near the end but for its originality and bizarreness  this is definitely worth seeing  spike jonze has made his directing debut that will be remembered for a long time,black_comedy
while watching the movie i started getting confused on what was happening in front of me but when the movie ended all i could say was wow that was a great movie great acting by cusack and diaz  the movie definitely makes you think another 10,black_comedy
one of the most original movies in quite some time  excellent script and wonderful performances  you dont even mind the occasional boom mike hanging in the shot  it is subtly overthetop if there is such a thing,black_comedy
there are so many tacky onetrick movies made these days and many of them go on to earn a small fortunethat when i first saw a trailer for this movie and it described how it was about a man who finds a portal into someone elses head my immediate reaction was to wonder what sort of crap was going to be foisted on us now but this time i was wrong it reminds me of a quote from a book i read recently about horses and zebras its something along the lines that because horses are common and zebras are rare at least they are outside of africa then if you hear hooves coming its likely to be horses every now and again though the unexpected happens and thats how i feel about this movie from the opening minutes of this film you know youre seeing something unique and part of the brilliance of this movie is that it never slackens its pace surely one of the best movies of the last 10 years it deserves the awards its already won and should go on to get a whole lot more,black_comedy
just misses being a great movie because it has to resolve too many odd situations  while the film takes you down paths you probably cant predict and dont want to the set up is better than the delivery  the parts that are good are very good and the film will probably seem better in a few years so i recommend it  still the film starts on a roller coaster but ends in teacups  too bad there turned out to be a plot its nice that most threads were wrapped up but not so nice that most of the madness got explained away  kudos to malkovich for daring to expose himself in this manner,black_comedy
i think everyone will get something different out of this  if youre the kind of person who cant sit through something that you consider to be strange or weird then dont go see it  otherwise give it a chance i can almost guarentee that at least some part of this movie will make ya think or at least make ya laugh,black_comedy
spike jonz is the new terry gilliam he creates a wonderul loopy world that despite its absurdity pulls you in immediately and has you believing in its logic i think this flick is destined to be a minor classic jonz is a talent that likely will flourish as he has that ability like my favorite directors of creating a time and a place an environment that the viewer enters and inhabits along with the characters john cusak and cameron diaz two actors i do not like much were very very good and jonz should be canonized for giving a role to orson bean welcome back orson,black_comedy
i love johns work in this and many of his other titles but this movie had so much potential that was wasted  the character played by john cusak and his wife had so much more potential  although i have to admit the carrying on as a puppeteer was funny   however without giving anything away i wont say who but sleeping with john m in order to sleep with someone else is pretty pathetic   just my thoughts,black_comedy
first off let me emphasize that as a movie year 1999 has been on of the best in recent memory  has to be the most original movie this past year and one of the best overall  the basic premise is that a puppet maker john cusack takes a filing job at a strange office on the 7 12 floor  while digging behind one of his filing cabinets he discovers a portal into actor john malkovichs head  from that point the movie takes on a truly surrealistic direction  eventually there are hundreds of people paying money to spend 15 minutes in john malkovichs head witnessing various mundane things like taxi rides to the more exotic like having sex  this movie also had me asking questions that were answered later on like what happens if john malkovich goes into the portal into his head  it is an intriguing journey into our more primal fantasies essentially playing on psychologist jeungs collective unconsciousness twisting it into a collective consicousness  the movie is quite freudian in the primal sense yet drawing on some of the more modern behaviorist philosphies  lets all hope that hollywood wakes up and sees that the blockbuster is officially dead and creative intelligent movies are back in full swing  john malkovich should be nominated for best actor this year if you havent seen this movie go see it today  its on par with imho the best movie of the 90s american beauty,black_comedy
critics are praising and this film is on many a top ten lists so i guess i am in the minority  although is one of the most original and inventive films ever it just did not stir me that much nor did i find it hugely entertaining nor very funny  maybe this film was just too bizarre for me but once i accepted the concept it still did not make me walk out of the theater saying wow  this doesnt make sense to me since it has much going for itjohn cusack plays craig schwartz a brilliant puppeteer who just cant seem to make a living at a craft that he loves  after his wife lotte cameron diaz almost unrecognizable suggests that he find some other means of work until the puppet thing takes off craig finds himself working for a filing company lestercorp which is located on floor 7  a great concept in itself  one day at the office craig finds a small hidden doorway behind a filing cabinet  naturally curious about it he enters or should i say crawls through this space only to find out that it is a portal into the mind of actor john malkovich this portal allows the traveler 15 minutes inside mr malkovich as he goes about his everyday business until eventually spewing the person onto the new jersey turnpike roadside another great concept  eager about the prospect craig informs his coworker the ice queen supremo maxine catherine keener of his discovery and soon the two become partners in jm inc which provides the public 15 minutes of for 200 a pop  once craigs wife lotte takes the malkovich spin she begins to question her sexual identity and her and craig begin to battle for maxines affection through john malkovichs conscience yes it sounds totally bizarre and it is but it all makes sense somehow  i just wished i had enjoyed it much more than i actually did because it is not only original but very cleaver it just did not do much for mespike jonze who was one of the soldiers in the film three kings does a great job in creating a highly conceptual film that has a lot to say about the publics fascination with celebrities how we relate to people and how we force ourselves to fit into certain situations credit also goes to screenwriter charlie kaufman and also the acting here which is very good john cusack and cameron diaz do fine work and both have their appearance altered from their usual norm especially diaz who downright looks like she need a big time scrub and that hair its hysterical  cusack has captured the down and trodden performer who has to swallow his pride to take such a meaningless job  his mannerisms are wonderful all the right little tics diaz does a complete turnaround compared to her very strongwilled and tough as nails performance in any given sunday  she takes a role that could easily been a caricature and turns it into a complete and believable character  john malkovich does a good job as what else john malkovich and he is definitely a good sport about the whole thing but what the hell you get to have a movie named after you  but the standout here goes to the wonderful actress catherine keener who always does excellent work living in oblivion your friends  neighbors  to be able to make even such an icecold character as maxine likable is an accomplishment  its a very good performanceso here is a picture that is original imaginative witty welldirected well acted but yet i just was not crazy about it  for me all the parts just did not add up to a very satisfying whole although i did enjoy the 2nd half of the film much better than the first and got more involved in it at that point  check it out though if you want to see something totally unique and original a hit and miss recommendation    out of 5,black_comedy
is probably one of the most overrated films this year  hailed as unique and visionary it is a soso creation with more fluff than substance  the flashy use of edgy camera work coupled with the overindulgence of the odd and lack of character development makes this film one big questiion mark  who are these people what makes them tick and why should i care this is not to say the movie was horrible completely without merit  to be fair charlie sheen was hilarious and the chimp at one point steals the show  no this movie wasnt horrible it was mediocre with enough offbeat elements to fool the moviegoing audience into thinking they had seen something truly creative,black_comedy
i just saw a screening  this film is so perfectly bizarre funny and human that im sure youll enjoy it  go with someone you like talking to afterwards  cameos you wont believe and malkovich does a great cusack no matter how much you think you know about it youll be surprised,black_comedy
the characters in this extraordinary movie suffer from a lack of identity  even to the extent of being found on an inbetween floor 712 not quite here and not quite there without a full stature they cant get what or whom they want so their resort is either manipulating the person they desire to bring him or her to do what they want or live by proxy through the eyes of someone who is desiredthe movie well directed and acted uses science fiction as a genre but not as a goal together with a tongueincheek sense of warped humorif you like this movie its metaphysics and humor you should read flann obriens third policeman and watch newleys 1969 movie can hieronymus merkin ever forget mercy humppe and find true happiness,black_comedy
a hilarious black comedy that also poses much symbolism to our everyday life the scenes in the 7 12 floor are hilarious so are the scenes when john malchovich becomes himself it also a story about being stuck in your own life and yearning to become someone else first the main charecter is a man trying to do the thing he loves puppeteering he cannot support his family doing that so he has to get a job filing second he finds a way to escape his life as a man stuck in a dead end job and become another more sucsessful person who gets by doing what they love enter john malcovich third he gets blinded by lust and ends up losing his sanity and his wife fourth he starts a new life as a puppeteer using someone elses life fifth he loses it all and becomes trapped in another life it also poses provocative questions about love and how love is not contained in boundries of a persons sex and how it is a spiritual bond i works on many levels as a smart hysterical comedy a social commentary and as an amazingly innovated peice of cinema a mustsee by any person i urge you all to become john malcovich,black_comedy
what can be said about without destroying the wonderful surprises in store spike jonze has made numerous short films and videos before embarking upon this visual treat and he is one of the few music video directors who actually brings a great deal of thought or resonance to his images his offbeat sensibility is ideally suited for charlie kaufmans imaginative and wildly original screenplay the premise alone revealed in the title captures the sense of having your 15 minutes of fame inside an actor who not everyone knows by nameyes puppeteer john cusack takes a job working as a file clerk on the 7  floor and lo and behold he discovers a portal into the mind of jm himself after 15 minutes he is unceremoniously dumped on the side of the new jersey turnpike the film takes its time before providing us with this wonderful scene thoroughly developing the characters of frustrated artiste cusack his frustrated and frumpy wife played by an unrecognizable cameron diaz and cusacks sassy sexy vixeny coworker catherine keener all in top form and some under the most brilliant hair design since the farrelly brothers virtuoso work in kingpinand then we begin our adventure seeing the world through the eyes of jm going in directions one wouldnt expect and even if it does it goes beyond those initial variables into some truly stunning and unexpected variations in terms of character development plot space and timewell filmed and surprisingly subtle not going for large scale effects with impeccable taste style and a flair for the theatrical without becoming overpronounced or gauche ranks as one of my biggest delights this screengoing year john malkovich of course steals the show it is after all his head,black_comedy
this is what happens when spike jonze michael stipe and john malkovich get mixed togetherthis isnt a cusak film and it certainly isnt a diaz film  usually they have roles in a very personalityfilled characters  their personalities meant nothing in this one  nobodys personalities meant anything  this wasnt a character moviethats obviously what made it different  it didnt rely on the crutch of having a clear antagonist and protagonist that 99 percent of films useas far as good acting goes it doesnt really matter  i wouldnt say there were any remarkable performances but like i said it wasnt that type of filmyou gotta see this one youll know what i meanand when you walk out of the theatre youll pay particular attention to how you move,black_comedy
is original from start to finish and makes interesting conversation for after the movie however some people may become motion sick during the picture due to the ackward angle in which some scenes were filmed the plot is engrossing and the scene changes are so seamless that they are almost impossible to detect in the first viewingsome people will love this movie but others will hate it it really depends on your ability to enjoy things from a different perspective,black_comedy
these days critics and even noncritics complain quite frequently about the number of cookiecutter motion pictures out on the market cookiecutter refers to common formulaic movies that basically tell a different version of the same general story that people have heard many times before from generic teenbased romantic comedies to uninspired scary slasher films i never go to any film that falls in these categories rehashes can be found everywhere as well as cranky critics yearning for innovation well folks put away your cookiedough and get ready for a new kind of treat     today in societys cookingwithfilm weve prepared something truly original and we like to call it its a comedy to be sure but we took our time in meticulously planning this wellbalanced meal into something smart and fresh for example where else can you take a big bite out of a gag known as the 7 12th floor where the ceilings are lowoverhead and the elevators must be pried open to get there how about a chimp who is in psychotherapy and goes through a flashback complete with subtitles for those of us who dont speak apelanguage a strange sequence where everyone looks like malkovich and every word spoken is malkovich timely messages about manipulation sexual identity control celebrity and the need for release of ones own boring life how about some big laughs to go with it its all here and we made sure to use our deluxe eggbeater for this job seriously folks no one will find anything like this all year for about 110 minutes director spike jonze pushes the envelope taking us down hidden tracks in the roller coaster of innovation whenever i could see in the distance where was headed the results genuinely surprised me the acting was superb all around with john cusack cameron diaz and catherine keener drawing us into their own little movieworld where we dont spend time hunting for seams in plot most impressive of all is you guessed it john malkovich who has the interestingbuttough job of reinventing himself as a man being possessed by others he gets all the little details right theres not a single contrivance throughout his catastrophic situation what a great sport he is for letting the filmmakers poke fun at him throughout the movie       in the end deserves a place on many best 10 lists at the end of 1999 and definitely a nomination for best picture along with american beauty and the green mile if the academy members dont consider this they need portals into their heads so someone can slap some sense into them for the rest of us bon apetite,black_comedy
this film tries to be existentialist but is too watered down with a substandard plot and uninteresting characters basically it fails to entertain most of my friends who went also yawned afterwards and i really wanted to like this movie also the sexual subplot is just jarring i didnt expect it and it didnt fitone good thing is the acting by jm as i actually felt the prescence of cusacks character when he inhibited malkhovich my rating 710,black_comedy
i saw yesterday and i was not disappointed  it is a well written well acted black comedy with tremendous performances by cameron diaz you wont even recognize her john cusack the excellent catherine keener and of course john malkovich  the movie reminded me of something monty python would have done it is a ridiculous notion that you can enter someones head for 15 minutes at a time but early on in the movie you just come to accept this and appreciate this and then you start to think about the philosophical ramifications of such travel  i highly recommend this film its not like double jeopardy that plugs performers into a tired formula rather spike jonze attempts something different and unique and it pays off  bravo,black_comedy
this is a great film easily the best ive seen this year easily frankly i cant understand in the slightest how one could possibly dislike it but ive read many comments here by reviewers complaining that it was poorly directed or that certain themes were less than adequately explored in my opinion charlie kaufman left the film so completely open for a very specific reason his intention it seems was not to impart upon viewers his philosophical views  opinions on matters metaphysical but rather to open the heads of his audience this is a film that invites or rather demands thought while there are certainly some very intense questions raised only a fool could casually dismiss this film as pretentious i think that it is just the opposite it doesnt claim to be anything other than a giddy surreal comedic adventure albeit with some serious even grave undercurrents one article reviewing malkovich said that it probably would have been better constructed by a director with a stronger visual presence say terry gilliam while this may be true i think it is only fair to give spike jonze the benefit of the doubt as a rookie director malkovich is a difficult film to bring to life  is certainly more so for a director who hasnt yet gotten his imagery sealegs for the medium kevin smith is on his 4th film  is just beginning to tackle this aspect of filmmaking in all is a stunning piece of art the myriad of opinions on it speaks volumes about its power to leave the viewer in the drivers seat ive always wanted to say this  it finally applies if you only see one more movie this millennium see thisside note if malkovich isnt favored for best original screenplay the academy has its head up its collective ass,black_comedy
ive seen it enjoyed it but is it really that good  i have to admit although i do enjoy out of the ordinary movies i rarely if ever check out independent movies and thats what this is  is an independent film with big name actors thats what separates it from the throngs of other different independent films out there with casts of john does not john malkovichs  given it was out there and thats what myself along with millions of other people find refreshing about this film  but what millions of people also fail to realize is that there are hundreds of movies like this released every year with fantasic ideas wonderfully written masterfully directed but one glaring difference remains  big names in the credits  the end,black_comedy
there is only one other film that i can compare this to brazil and is clearly superior to brazil i suggest you see this film if for no other reason but for it being almost totally unique in the world comparing this movie to anything is almost a disservice to it its just that different certainly not for everyone,black_comedy
the movie had its share of laughs it was quirky and offbeat which i loved however the relationships between the characters was inconsistent for lack of a better word and i just could not accept their behavior as being believablei think it would have been much more successful if it were simply quirky and offbeat or a movie about the relationships  it was as though the quirkiness was not enough to sustain the plotim sure very few out there agree with me but id give it a 710  and i went to the theatre really wanting to like it,black_comedy
if anyplace still has midnight movies this would make a perfect one clever and quite quite offthewall it is certainly the most unique movie of the year  there are a lot of things to like about it but somehow it just didnt really do it for me  i certainly didnt fall in love with it like most other commentors have  maybe if the atmosphere hadnt been so relentlessly dank and the characters a tad bit more likable my emotions could have been gripped more but as it was i just left the theater respecting the intelligence that went into it grateful for a couple of decent laughs and knowing that ill have basically forgotten it in a few hours  i think people are just so hungry for innovative stories and something different from the usual hollywood product that they have quite substantially overrated this movie  as it stands currently this has been rated the 15th greatest film of all time by imdb users huh,black_comedy
this was the most original movie i have ever seen unlike almost every other film thats come out recently there are no parallels between it and another film it was so wacky so out of the norm that it was the most natural thing in the world cameron diaz was incredible i didnt recognize her at first nor did i recognize john cusak and thats part of the films charm the actors dont seem like actors with perfect hair and skin but like real peoplecharlie sheen was a wonderful surprise he played himself very well along with the host of celebs popping up as themselves throughout the entire thing i noticed brad pitt and hansoni have to say that not only was this the most original movie ive seen but it ranks as one of my favorite films ever,black_comedy
the first rule about is see the second rule about is see this is the most original movie ive seen in a few years there are no huge explosions and the lone chase scene doesnt involve cars planes or space ships unlike many art house movies i didnt need to struggle to understand or enjoy it its a film about human identity a story in which a number of characters struggle to express themselves to find fulfillment and to pursue happiness  in ways that are rather bizarre  they live in a skewed version of reality either that or new york city has gotten worse since my last visit  we have passed through the looking glass and some things are not what they appear to be  the characters are interesting and welldeveloped the humor is dark and incisive john cusack and cameron diaz are deep in character and barely recognizable catherine keener is the ultimate femme fatale orson bean is hilarious john malkovich is brilliant  and very convincing  as himself,black_comedy
quite simply put this movie blew my mind  i came out of it laughing with disbelief at how incredibly wierd and cool and brilliant it was  it is a stunning film that is one of the most creative and original pieces of work ever made  the sheer genius of the script brought to life with spike jonzes masterful direction coupled with wonderful performances especially that of john malkovich himselfwhat a cool guy  the fact that he let this get made and had a part of it really makes me admire the guy more than i already did  i am not going to say anything about the plot not a word because its better you have no idea whatsoever what will happen going into it  it is genius  one of the freshest and funnest movies ive ever seen one of the best movies ive seen this year definately  this better win some awards or i will lose faith in every movie awards ceremony in existance umwow  thats all i can sayoh well that and go see this movie as soon as humanly possible  it will twist your mind around and leave you giddy with a smile on your face afterwards a true piece of brilliant art wow 1010,black_comedy
somewhat thought provoking but not very satisfying upon contemplation some good gags but the movie loses rather than gains momentum  goes on too long considering that a real conclusion never comes why is this getting nearly unanimous rave reviews  there is no clear message  what is the purpose of the film  to get us thinking about celebrity movie making sexual obsession immortality  lots of teases but no clear focus,black_comedy
this is definitely one of the most original films ever created the whole concept was bizarre and surreal but it make the journey all the more enjoyable the script by charlie kaufman is quirky and hilarious but what the film has most going for it is the element of surprise you never know what will happen next the performances were wonderful across the board with an extremely talented cast playing roles against typejohn cusack has made the biggest stretch hes made as an actor in a very long time he downplayed his usual wisecracking persona to play a more subtle and pathetic character great acting choice if i didnt know cameron diaz was in the film beforehand i would have had a hard time recognizing her she was looking like bottomofthebarrel trailer trash throughout the movie and this is the best performance i have seen from her i was never truly impressed with her as an actress before but my head was turned here and i hope to see more of this caliber from her i have been a big fan of catherine keener since living in oblivion and she has further impressed me in walking  talking the real blonde and your friends  neighbors she is a wonderful actress with a spunky hardedged and sarcastic presence that is unavailable to most actresses working in hollywood today let us not forget john malkovich himself for another great performance here he as julia roberts did in notting hill shows that he is not just playing a caricature of himself but someone is his position with depth and ambiguity that i imagine is much different that himselfthe director spike jonze has recently starred in three kings by looks alone you couldnt tell that he would bring to life such an extraordinary motion picture this material had it been in other hands may not have been successful it was handled with the right amount of comedy and surrealism i hope this film is nominated for best picture next year,black_comedy
one of the most fascinating aspects of the imdb are the users comments with some thought we could all name some titles that with the exception of the schizophrenic and evangelical religious we could agree to categorize as good bad boring or great the fascination comes in the reading of reviews that describe completely competent films such as and the mix of praise or condemnation they offer see the numan2 review for example i agree with the bulk of the reviews ive read about this film this movie has a fresh plot one youve never seen before think about that for a moment even my cats turn up their noses to their favorite food at some point if i could give them a can of flaked jonze wmalkovich bits their world would be turned on its side thats what this movie does it twists everything you know about the world and how you thought things would turn out thats from what great science fiction stories are made as usual dont let anyone try to tell you what this movie is about go in ignorant let the director do the job for which he was hired stop thinking you know how the world works in this movie its very different,black_comedy
this movie is one of the strangest but funniest movies ive ever seen the chase scene through malkovichs subconscience the chimpanzees flashback to the jungle and of course mr malkovichs trip to his own mind i couldnt breathe i laughed so hardall some of the most odd scenes ive ever seenand yet as novel as the story of becoming john malkovich for 15 minutes at a time sounds it really plays wellnot just as a gimick but as a vehicle to tell a love story a very very odd love story  never once did i mutter this is stupidthat cant be done the writer and director i cant believe it was spike jonze simply make us accept the fact that these people can enter the mind of john malkovichthe rest just unfolds around thatbest original screenplayoh yeah and the puppetry was beautiful too,black_comedy
well first of course this a very interesting and original film with lots of laughs and many memorable images and cameron diaz allowed herself to look unrecognizable and homely as anything yay cameron but let me focus on the wonderful catherine keener whom i adore from living in oblivion not to mention the seinfeld where she paints kramers picture im so glad she has a really popular movie to record her greatness for all posterity the role is perfect for her so many cutting remarks said with a smileback to the film interesting inquiry into sexuality what if you love the personality but are not attracted to their body thats the basic question which perhaps the writer struggled with in his own life if only i could be inside the body of someone sexually attractive like john malkovich i could then have sex with all the people i find attractive actually this may be where the story went downhill for some people and got quite dark i can see many  people had trouble with cameron in a cage as well you should if that werent upsetting then thered be a problem,black_comedy
for all its sharp humor engaging performances and unflinching willingness to pursue a patently ludicrous premise with the utmost seriousness seems in the end to suffer from a frustrating meanspiritednessthe films first half is strong as it dumps the viewer into the lackluster life of a very bedraggledlooking john cusack the outofwork puppeteer who wades through a dreary life of thwarted artistic vision and a joyless marriage in his discovery of a portal into john malkovichs head he finds an ultimate escapism the ability to experience slices of life through the eyes of someone more successful than himself it is to the films credit that it doesnt dwell on the absurdity of the discovery rather it pursues the practical ramifications the impact on cusacks life and marriage and the notion of using the portal for profitunfortunately the film shoots itself in the foot as it wears on the filmmakers elect to provide an awkward and convoluted explanation for the phenomenon which removes a good deal of its fantastic charm and as the characters begin to reap what they have sown our sympathy for them begins to flag the crime is not that we see human beings being ugly but that our early hopes for them are extinguished by the films end in a numbing series of various defeats in sam raimis largelyoverlooked a simple plan avarice and deceit resulted in tragedy and loss the moral lesson was clear in the filmmakers seem to dole out punishments with complete abandon nobody is any wiser for their misfortune and the films initially intriguing sexual identity subtext ends up feeling like a sermon on love delivered by characters who have shown themselves to know nothing of itstill is a provocative and thoughtful work wellwritten wellacted and welldirected though it may not rank as a truly intellectual film it is unique enough to distinguish itself from its boxoffice competition and its gilliamesque tone and touches should assure it a place in surrealist comedydrama history,black_comedy
this film is absolutely awesome  never have i seen anything quite like this  in a span of only its first 15 minutes this film covered and delved into much deeper themes that most movies cant even fully develop in a three hour time slotcameron diaz shows us a side of her acting that she has not ever shown before  instead of playing the cute and stylish dream girl as she played in my best friends wedding and theres something about mary she trades in her chic blond hair for a massive mousy brown nest of frizz the superficial attitude and flights of giggles are gone her character has depth and diaz does an excellent job of playing opposite john cusackbravos to malkovick playing himself cusack diaz and catherine keener this movie is a kickbutt premier for spike jonze i cant wait to see his next feature length filmthis is a must see for anyone who has ever wanted to be someone else anyone who craves more to life than whats on the surface andor anyone who has ever wondered just who really is in control of hisher lifebe sure to see this with someone intelligent so you can wage some decent discussion and debate afterwardsthere are strings attached  you wont walk out of this movie as the same exact person as you were when you walked in  if you understand any of the many themes you will feel enlightenedwhat more could you want in a film  theres satire about american society philosophical thought throughout a mirror of the quientisential everyman and its all tied together with an edge of eerieness straightup humor and cameos by sean penn and brad pitt all while poking fun at itselfthis smorgashboard of good stuff makes being john malkovick a hit  i walked out of this film introspectively examining myself but looking at the world through a new pair of surrealist sunglasses,black_comedy
to describe my experience seeing this film you would have to imagine an amusement park ride that is simultaneously physically exhilarating and profoundly moving the genius of spike jonzes first feature is located not in a brilliantly inventive idea wellexecuted but in a sensibility that is expansive enough to take in a world beyond that idea characters and situations the tortured performance artist puppeteer  the office located on the 7  floor the chimp with unresolved childhood trauma are both absurd and completely believable while the absurd aspects of this story have gotten it attention the themes of  lost selfidentity unrequited love success  failure are what ultimately make this film,black_comedy
rarely have i come across something so interesting it is not at all just simply a comedy but an intelligently done genre defining movie that is wickedly funny disturbing absurd and even sad what makes it even more interesting is how all the characters are not phased by the absurdity around them most people would make a big deal about a building with a 75 floor and strange portals into actors minds that drop us off into the nj turnpike yet the character take it as it comes as if it is a very interesting turn in their lives perhaps they are unique because of the rather strange lives they leadenough about absurdity this is definitely one of the most creative movies i have ever come across,black_comedy
when terry gilliams film adaptation of fear and loathing in las vegas was released last year j hoberman loved it and wrote in the village voice approximation brilliant original and insane how did this movie ever get made much the same could be said of which ranks with american beauty three kings bringing out the dead after life and run lola run as one of the best films of 1999 although i am in the minority with regard to the visual stylei wish jonze had been more flamboyant like the aforementioned gilliamas opposed to the realistic look he used i can still understand why he took that route charlie kaufman the writer and jonze tosses off more ideas in ten minutes than most movies do in their entire running length it also happens to be laughoutloud funny in some parts there is a slightly misogynistic bit about a woman getting locked in a cage but the character who does this definitely gets his comeuppance to sum up this film is demented twisted hysterical poignant and wacky with brilliant acting great writing a fabulous score by carter burwell and fine direction see it you wont regret it,black_comedy
this movie started out with a great idea imagine being able to climb into a famous persons head and live their life with them for a few hours but herein lies the problem id rather be anyone besides john malkovich who really wants to be john malkovich how about being jackie chan or harrison ford clint eastwood arnold schwarzenegger or mel gibson why not someone other than an actor like george lucas steven spielberg or oliver stone why not a world leader like bill clinton tony blair jiang zemin gerhard schroeder or kim daejung why not a woman why someone white could we find someone more interesting than john malkovichthis movie started out as a funny movie the poor puppeteer cant find a job as a puppeteer so he goes to an office located in between floors in something akin to a finished crawlspace built ostensibly for midgets and only accessible by stopping the elevator between floors and prying open the doors with a crowbar serious dialogue is incredibly funny when one is hunched over bumping his head on the ceiling and talking over the ringing bell of the elevator while delivering itthe movie gets tedious quickly however a bizarre lovetrianglesquare develops and that drags the movie along with a few other suspensionofbeliefrupturing developments into the zone of the bizarre and boring had this movie shied away from the totally demented and stayed closer to the humorous it would have been in my opinion a much better movie,black_comedy
i saw this at a special preview and all i can say is wow i have never seen anything quite like it its completely different to anything i have ever seen before its weird wacky and absorbing definately my favorite film this year i shall be going to see it again when it is released in the uk,black_comedy
this film blew me away kept me off balance in the way that a terry gilliam film would and i laughed so much i hurtthere is a strong visual element of absurdity that is as arresting and hilarious as the bizarre characters and situations what an imagination i dont know if the writer or director deserves most of the credit certainly the direction is perfect even though i understand spike jonze is a relative newcomerdont miss this film  see it with an intelligent person who loves to laugh,black_comedy
im amazed that all reviewers seem to have missed what i think the main theme of this movie was and thats the obsession and resulting competition between the main character and his wife for the attention of a vamp i still think it a terrific movie but wonder why i seem to have seen it differently than most others,black_comedy
the local reviews i read of were not too enthusiastic so when i saw this movie today my expectations were amazingly exceeded this movie was thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish no lags no lame dialog very few cliches as a science fiction its very surreal much like terry gilliams brazil the comedy is equally well done a bit bizarre like the old saturday night live and monty pythons flying circus and the romantic aspect is twisted beyond anything youve ever imaginedalthough the movie contains elements of other work as mentioned above overall its extremely unique very refreshing and cleverly done i think it would be most enjoyed by those of us who have a slightly twisted sense of humor and some familiarity with john malkovich,black_comedy
is one of the most ingenious creative and bizarre movies that ive ever seen  there is never a tedious moment in the film charles kaufman creates an utterly original heap of entertainment that makes alice in wonderland look like a teen flick whether youre laughing or crying the film will keep you on your toesthe first few minutes are a little sluggish but you still find yourself intrigued by the bizarre camera work  john cusack plays craig schwartz a deprived puppeteer who is an brilliant yet sadly unknown puppet master schwartz doesnt think he needs a day job until he offends a little girls father with one of his puppet shows and gets punched square in the face after that he realizes that he needs a day job to support his wife and hopefully a future childcusacks job interview leads to some of the funniest 20 minutes i have ever seen on screen  with dark and intellectual comedy at its best its one of those scenes were you just die laughing in the aislescusacks boss is old senile and thinks he has a speech impediment when actually he talks better than cusack himself he works on the 7  floor where the ceiling raises 5 feet above the floor  its a place were everyone has to bend over to walk while filing one day cusack drops a folder behind a file cabinet  while retrieving it he finds a small door that leads inside the brain of john malkovichthese minutes of entertainment never dumb down or slow up  it just gets better and more surreal you would expect them to run out of ideas but they dont  the laughs come on stronger and the movie bullets in a different directioncusack ends up only being able to spend 15 minutes in malkovich and afterwards gets dumped out by the side of the new jersey turnpike he proceeds to tell his wife played by the beautiful cameron diaz who in this movie looks appalling and utterly unattractive  she wants to try it and what she ends up finding is not a portal within john malkovich but rather a mirror into her innermost desires  she finds her true self in another persons bodyinstead of using this portal to try to find what the significance of it is diaz and cusack use it to fulfill their sexual fantasies with cusacks coworker played by the lovely catherine keener  however it seems she is only attracted to them when they are within the body of malkovichthe plot spirals into many different directions at this point and steers clear of comedy it becomes a philosophical message which is the only way we can be who we truly are is in the mask of someone elsecould be considered the truman show of 1999 only more imaginative and bizarre the film is so deep that its poetic everything in the movie has a meaning and represents a symbol for lifejohn cusack gives an firstrate performance  in the beginning you feel sorry for him  in the middle you hate him at the end you feel sorry once for him more cameron diaz clearly has made the transition from comedy to drama and establishes herself as a future award winnerthe last words heard in the film are the words look away muttered by cusack in a depressive state  however you cant look away you are so intrigued by the ending that you cant do anything but look intently at the film this film deserves a standing ovation for what it has done for filmmakers  it tells them to think of every possibility  hopefully we will see more original films like malkovich and less clichd films like house on haunted hill  chris sandberg4 out of 4 stars,black_comedy
hello so i got to see this because we get to see quite a few movies to screen at uw university of washington  saw it last week or so and it was probably the craziest movie of the year  it was dark twisted insane hilarious at times  there are a few boring parts for the most part the movie rocked it was 100 precent unique  no other movie has come close to being anything like this  i loved it in the end and recommend it  grades a4 stars95 rating,black_comedy
sorry but im another among people who cant understand whats so great about this movie i am a kind of scififantasy fan but if this movie is scifi its crap ideas are neither consistent nor explained or believable why does person have to enter vessel before certain time what happens if more people enter same vessel etc add main characters love affairs and you get an artsy version of contemporary soap opera nice to watch relax eat popcorn while its on but nothing more  610 and im very generous,black_comedy
20 minutes into this movie i had to turn it off i couldnt take it anymore  started having those andy warhol flashbacks although seeing john cusack getting punched was actually the highlight wish that guy would have punched more of the actors in the movie the director needs to go back to music videos sure they arent very good either but at least you can listen to the music rather than some idiot rambling on about life or whatever he was talking about  10 stars out of 10,black_comedy
after hearing the critics rave about how intelligent creative and funny this film is my friends and i decided to give it a try  what a mistake the movie is about going through a little door in a building and ending up in john malkovichs head after 15 minutes they would be dumped out by the new jersey turnpike answer me this  how is this intelligent or creative  it sounds like a story i wrote in 1st grade  do people have such small minds that this is creative to them  if so thats really sad  my girlfriend fell asleep after the first hour and she was the lucky one  my other friends and i sat in disbelief as we kept waiting for something to happen it never did  i never thought id say this but universal soldier the return was better than this piece of trash it was the biggest waste of 700 i have ever seen score  0 out of 1000000000,black_comedy
okay i get it  i dont get it  this film is not a total waste of time  it has some interesting scenes and some good performances but  i think that john malkovich needs help  this man is not an actor he reminds me of that other crazy andy kauffman  i cant imagine the writerwriters of this film did not have assistance from the very beginning from mr malkovich and that is frightening  i would rather have my children watch the tapes of the columbine high school shootings than watch this trash  however orson bean was superb,black_comedy
this has got to be the funniest film ive see in a long time  knowing full well that john malkovich would feature heavily within the plot i couldnt wait to laugh at his slapheaded exploits  but the sheer amount of freaky goings on was too much  its not a slapstick film or even a witty comedy but the sight of jm going mad because he thinks hes being cursed by a freaky lesbian witch is too stupid not to laugh at  the end was not great and a little bit sad too  but when jm goes inside his own head and appears in a bizarre restaurant well see for yourself  i really didnt want this film to end because i was intrigued to see what happened next  perhaps too arty for some especially all that puppeteering but always amusing this is a film i could recommend to anybody with a soul,black_comedy
ok first off im sure there are people that love this movie i dont know why they would but maybe they saw depth or something they liked in it good for them not criticizing you just the movie i hated this movie so much that i went and created a new imdb account just so i could tell everyone how horrible it is and they might be spared from watching it i think the main reason i hated it is because i was looking for a funny cheerful or at least bearably entertaining movie to watch and i ended up seeing this its not fun its not cheerful and forget entertaining i cant even believe the actors were paid the guys acting is very over the top and the low ceilinged office doesnt even make sense as an aspect of the movie and cameron diaz is unrecognizable and though she played her role perfectly i didnt wanna see it it was such a horrible movie after 20 minutes i just started jumping forward to see the ending worst waste of 30 minutes ever it was not artsy it was awful,black_comedy
and i wouldnt be surprised to find that spike jonze is a relativelets make it quicka milquetoast puppeteer cusack his wildly environmentalist wife diaz and his opportunistic coworker keener discover a portal which leads from the 13th floor of an office building into the conscious of actor john malkovich it becomes a great way to make some quick cash until the actor himself finds out and the true purpose of the portal is revealedgrantedthe film is definitely unique and is a scathing honest comment on americas overdone obsession with celebrity unfortunately it has no staying power in the area of cinema so many celebritiesand critics with celebrities for friendssang its praises so loudly that it came to mean nothing to those of us who arent celebrity thus the mission failed the story pushes the point a little too hard and there are almost no characters to like most heartbreaking is the character orson bean playshaving been used to him playing a cornucopia of charming characters i was saddened to see him reduced to the role of a wacky twisted cultleader i would not see this film againironically the only reason to see this contrivance is malkovich himself he firmly steals the show from the climax to the very end after this film i gained new respect for him as an actor i guess it wasnt a total lossokay okay one more star but thats it,black_comedy
is a laugh out loud creative hootit is incomparably inventivewith kaufman writing the script particularly with the titular actor in mind its hard to think of what other actors persona would fit in as well as malkovichs protean roles leaning toward the bad guys makes for an effective backstory that say another wouldnt work as well it was like a monty python cartoon come to life  completely unpredictable and creative in every scene and in every angle and detail i think director spike jonze put in a bunch of references to music videos that also have an absurdist touch  such as the last scene looking like nirvanas in utero coveroriginally written 11141999,black_comedy
i realized the other day when i was doing my writeup of eternal sunshine of the spotless mind that i had never reviewed this film even though i had given it a 10 the equivalent of  it was the first charlie kaufman movie id seen and the one that made me a follower of his work for lifetruly is one of the most inventive mindboggling and subversively profound movies i have ever had the pleasure of experiencingand experiencing and experiencing  ive seen it more than once and it always comes across as fresh and i always marvel at it anew each time  cinematic achievement doesnt get any better than that for my money get the dvd in your hands as soon as possible and experience kaufmans inspired subversiveness for yourself,black_comedy
the storys idea is brilliant and innovative too bad it has to be reduced to a level of base sexual human behaviors the whole tone for the picture was set in the opening scene with the puppeteer manipulating the puppets to perform sexual acts as a child looked onthe whole idea of someone taking over someone else without regard for the other person is also a bit disturbing and no one seemed to have any regrets about it so long as they got to get what they wanted out of the deal the last scene of the next person who was to be taken over was also depressingthe movie does not project any sense of respect for human beings,black_comedy
spike jonze has to be one of the most overrated filmvideodirectors in history it seems everything he directscommercialsvideos is considered brilliant  i found hisvideos for weezer and the beastie boys entertaining but orsonwelles he is not i remember everyone saying being johnmalkovich was a masterpiece i found the first 30 minuteshilariously but then gradually the characters grew more and moreweird and unlikable and the story just falls apart into a muddledmess  i admire original filmmakers terry gilliam and luisbunuel are among my favorites but just because its originaldoesnt mean its good,black_comedy
if you havent seen and you are under the impression that this film is going to be completly weird you might be a little dissapointed when you watch this ok it is strange but in a silly way not in an arty way which is sad why john malkovich agreed to star in this or even let the film go ahead is a mystery to me now if the film was called being bradd pitt or being madonna in other words more interesting people this might have been better there are some good parts of the filmthe first half hour for instance when he first goes to his place of work  the seventh and half floor it has you gripped and is funny in part but like the portal in craigs office it goes down hill from there 6 out of 10,black_comedy
this is one i definitely dont get  i mean i get the moviebut i certainly dont get all the rave reviews and the hype  the movie was not brilliantthe story was new  the acting was speciali dont think soit looked very average  the movie did make me chuckle a few times but other than that it could be called being stupid  it was one of those much ado about nothing films nothing more nothing less  iow a bad waste of 399 for the rental  what was the purpose of the film  the only thing i could figure out was to show a fictional way to eternal life with way too much bs thrown in for good measure,black_comedy
the idea of entering someone elses brain for 15 minutes is interesting the fact that after those 15 minutes you are inexplicably dropped by the new jersey turnpike is funny just because well its silly and the fact that the brain you enter is john malkovich is different if nothing elsebut once you get used to those concepts and the existence of a floor in a building that is 60 percent the size of a normal floor to save on rent costs then you are left with  time to killi looked forward to seeing bjm and for the first 25 minutes i was entertained but then the surprises stopped coming instead we see more and more odd and generally uninteresting events concerning characters who are not likeable and whose motives are selfish and at times vague the last hour of the movie i kept glancing at my watch wondering when it would be overkudos to john malkovich for being willing to play this role though who wouldnt want a film with your name in it and i have to say i didnt even recognize cameron diaz cusack is fine as is the actress who plays maxine but they are all characters who are hard to like or care about and after you see the films main hook there isnt much else to do except wait out the conclusioni gave bjm a 5,black_comedy
until i saw this movie it had been a really long time since i felt i had completely wasted several hours  being a fan of independent film and esoteric comedy i was really looking forward to seeing this movie especially since it starred john cusack and cameron diaz two of my favoritesmy biggest reason for being so disappointed with this movie was that the theme was fresh and had so much potential that was never explored and even though the story was different the plot followed the typical big hollywood line making it boring and predictable  even with the predictable plot line the writing left holes and the directing made the movie choppy  this in turn limited the superior acting ability of the cast making their characters have no appealif youre looking for a big budget film with an independent feel get dogma if you want to try an esoteric comedy try naked lunch or cemetery man  if you want a big budget indie style film that claims to be an esoteric comedy then is for you  just dont expect to laugh,black_comedy
okay im probably going to get a lot of hate mail after people read this review but i thought was an awful movie and if not awful then certainly overrated the only reason i rented this movie thank god i didnt waste 650 on it at the theater was because all of my friendsrelatives were saying what a great movie it was and it didnt sound that bad at firstthe plot outline actually sounded pretty interesting and not to say that the acting wasnt good either but for some reaosn i just did not like this film at all first of all if you think this movie is funny or hilarious then your sense of humor is way way beyond mine i thought the idea of the 7thandahalf floor was humorous a few of the little jokes at the beginning were okay but after that i didnt laugh at all considering this is supposed to be mostly a comedy it makes the movie very boringsecond the movie is just too weird and unbelieveable for me and the weird thing is i love cult films and strange movies i have no problem with bizarre supernatural powers in movies and actually like that kind of thingi dont know you just dont get it okay when the building with the portal was built how did the portal get there i am still trying to figure out this part the lester guy showed us pictures of the office building with the portal inside of it being builtwhere does the opening to john malkovich come into being how does it work its just too radical for me to accept and its probably one of the reasons i didnt like the movie another part that had me wondering was when lottie was chasing maxine with the gun and they went from the locker room to the busoh never mind im just getting more confused it was not brilliant it was weird theres a differencethird the whole plot when you really boil down to it is about a perverted puppteer craig who wants to have sex with his coworker thats it and the rest is just the scenarios and problems he encounters while trying to get that sex and no offense to lesbiansgays but the whole thing with lottie and maxine in love was just sick im fine with movies about homosexuality boys dont cry and the band played on etc but it just didnt fly for me in john malkovichthe saving grace of this film was the acting john cusak cameron diaz john malkovich etc all did great at their parts you have to give the movie credit for one thingwell im sorry but there you have it i cant say that i enjoyed some movies are so bizarre their brilliant john malkovich is so bizarre its stupid and boring,black_comedy
has to be the worst movie i have ever wasted my time watching  i cannot believe that a single person can find anything worthy of mention in this movie  it is a sad reflection of the weird people that are beginning to become the norm in this world of ourswhat is worse is that it has been around for a month or so here and i hadnt heard how bad the movie is  while watching it i thought that it may be a candid camera movie theatre and the real joke was going to be released later  showing all the frowns and disbelief on theatregoers faces as the watched  and as they left the theatre  it was the one thing that i did enjoy  everyone wanted to talk about how bad the movie was as they exited  heads were shaking in utter disbeliefthats what i think its my duty and anyone whos seen it to tell others then its up to them,black_comedy
this movie was so bad it made me sick i cant believe i sat threw 120 minutes of pure junk i expected more out of this movie because i enjoy john malkovichs body of work has had over his distinguished careeri first noticed malkovich in con air when he portrayed cyrus the virus grissom really well i have since followed his career in amazement i can not believe how the other actors let such a great plot sink to such a level that there was no hope of recoveryfrom beginning to end i was lost in a maze of dialogue and bad development as well as execution on everyones part that i wanted to leave after 30 minutes however something told me to stick with because one never knows what will happen later on i was disappointed to learn that there was nothing worthwhile to see and i wasted my time on an awful moviei do not recommend this film to anyone nor would i allowed to be paid to watch it again,black_comedy
one of the most pretentious and irritating movies i ever hope to see  i hated every frame  i cant think of enough bad things to say about it  i want those two hours of my life back and i want them now  avoid at all costs cameron diaz is the perfect actress for this film as shes as lovely as she is talented  not even worth melting down for the silver content,black_comedy
was based on a very imaginative idea unfortunately spike jonze went in the wrong direction with it  what jonze should have done was make a lowbudget scifi flick with this porthole ideabut instead jonze tried to inject a lesson into it  normally i would commend a directors efforts to be meaningful but jonze  failed with his attemptfirst of all the film was poorly cast  when diaz lost her beauty she lost her believability too  cusack is a great actor but really screwed this one up  keener was ok but her character just stunk  malkovich on the other hand was perfect for the partsecond the movies try at being profound was shabby and feeble  making a point about being yourself vs seeing the world through someone elses eyes could  maybe should  have been done in a more tangibleor at least more focusedsetting  try again spike,black_comedy
stupid beginning a few giggles and depression  thats all this horrible film can offer you  i cant believe that people actually like this film i find it to be stupid depressing and well just completely unfunny  im shocked that a movie this bad would be made  it gets my vote for worst movie of all time,black_comedy
i can only say that this movie is completely awful  there is absolutely nothing to like about it the characters the hero in particular are unlikable  even though you do feel sorry for john cusacks character  you are still even more puzzled as to why he deserves so much pain in his life why must we see another movie that promotes the most negative and rotten sides of human nature  why does john cusacks character have to love a woman so evil that when he is confused and upset the only advice she can offer him is to point out a window so he can end his own life i dont get it  this movie is one of those pieces that once people come to their senses they will realize they were duped  i dont see how anyone could like it i dont consider seeing cameron diaz being locked up in a monkey cage by her husband john cusack who has been worked into a fit of rage because diaz decides to become a lesbian after being inside malkovich as anything worth watching i dont see how this can be high art or even comedy for that matter if this is dark comedy then i feel sorry for hollywood  its too bad that most movies today are so bad that something really bad confuses critics into liking it the plot is way too complicated for such a ridiculous movie  why do we need such a long explanation for why he can go inside malkovich  it seems all so contrived and forced  if i could suspend my disbelief for just one second maybe just maybe i could almost tolerate this movie as documentary on how to not make a movie when i saw the film my friend and i were 2 of 4 people in the theater half way through 2 people walked out and it wasnt my friend and i its a pretty good indication that a movie is bad if you lose half your audience during a showing i would have been a lot easier on this movie if it were not presented as an artindie film but a film should be reviewed on the level it is presented at thus a childrens film wouldnt be judged as hard as this movie because it was aimed at children i can best describe the this movie as a pseudo art film with some novelty thrown in i can say that the only funny joke is the one concerning the 7 and half a floor after that joke its all down hill,black_comedy
i cant believe this movie is so well received  i am officially warning all intelligent movie goers to avoid this one  with a concept barely strong enough to fill an snl skit being is boring and poorly acted  i sat through the whole movie hoping and waiting for something entertaining or enciteful but nothing emerged this movie is designed for the braindead and emotionally impaired  i gave it one star,black_comedy
that could be a quote from the director of this movie it was explain on awful lot is an original flick that took the country by storm i want to know how that can be the plot seems very odd and i guess that must have attracted some viewers thats why i was interested a big mistake that was this movie is incredibly boring as hell it cant be classified as a comedy at all the cast are all ugly as hell no eye candy at all the movie is another piece of garbage that does not fulfill anything at all i stood watching this movie in total silence and completely stunned as to how horrid this sucksspoilers the plot is the boring cast finds an unusual door that allows anyone to be malkovich for 15 minutes for some reason everyone thinks that is an incredible rush all events that happen are lame and boring the only thing in this movie that was funny was when john malkovich himself enters the door and is in a bizarre world where everyone looks like him the ending is depressing as hell thoughthe last word overrated beyond overrated another overhyped movie that for some reason is highly praised and everyone follows the crowd instead of taking a risk of being unpopular and saying it sucks dont be ashamed this is a terrible movie,black_comedy
a unique idea but the zaniness is a bit too much to overcome not the directors fault though spike jonzes filmography is defined by the offbeat and probably could be his most straightforward or accessible film but if so was the intention then he could have made this into a more box office friendly film the drab settings and production design and the bleak outlook dampened the mood the acting is good throughout and john malkovich is very good playing a scared version of himself and as mentioned at the start the idea is absolutely class,black_comedy

i wanted to be a philosophy major in college but i also wanted to be gainfully employed so i abandoned that wish philosophy has remained a way of which i spend my time a film philosophical in its premise will always be one that i gravitate towards the 1999 film by spike jonze is a film purely philosophical in its plot and approach the film stars john cusack as a man who makes a living as a puppeteer desperate to control an aspect of his otherwise meaningless existence when he finds a portal which allows people to enter into the head of actor john malkovich he attempts to make a profit with his business affiliate played by catherine keener when both his business affiliate and wife played by cameron diaz fall in love with the actor he has lost even more control of his life and may go to extreme measures to gain controlcraig schwartz john cusack is a struggling puppeteer who builds his own puppets and is desperate to make a living doing the work he is impassioned with lives a life that is filled with mundane activities when his wife and animal lover lottie who herself owns a pet store encourages him to finally get a job craig finds himself at a company called lestercorp located on the seventh and a half floor with ceilings so low one cant fully extend their body to an upright position to work as a file clerk something seems off about this building and its personnel immediately before craig can even learn the half of it im punny while attempting to settle into his new work environment one day craig stumbles upon a small door in his office that leads him into the head of actor john malkovich craig and his coworker maxine lund catherine keener decide to sell 15minute increments of time in john malkovichs head as an experience to the public at first the revelation makes craig feel as though he has some control and purpose over his life and the lives of others soon however his coworker and crush maxine begins to fall in love with the actor then craigs wife falls in love with him as well after her 15minute ride in the mind of john malkovich his newfound control and purpose begin to spiral out of control leaving craig desperate to find a way to gain it back despite what that means to anyone involvedthe idea of self is heavily explored throughout malkovichs self is intruded upon and under constant threat which is a cardinal worry of many social philosophers what does free will enter and how can one maintain their grasp on their free will when it is constantly under siege from so many intruders around us human isolation is also clearly illustrated throughout each of craigs puppets is separated by a wall or some other object and each of the people we meet in craigs life doesnt spend too much time surrounded by others even the communal experience of gaining entry to john malkovichs head further isolates people once their time as him ends each person that comes out of john malkovich leaves appreciating his life more and their life less further calling to question issues of self perhaps the most overarching issue examined in jonzes film is the question of the existence of a soul what is beyond life and self and breaches the metaphysics is anything each person seems more apt to explore the being of john malkovich than actually explore their own identities perhaps there is nothing to the idea of soul to the filmmaker either way the existence of soul the examination of self and human isolation are extreme areas of interest to the plot and background of,black_comedy
excellent acting does not make up lack of quality writing unfortunately this movies refreshingly original plot ideas and philosophical perspectives on identity are utterly wasted on a movie that is not remotely enjoyable none of the characters are likable and the amoral nature of the whole plot ditches character development and abandons reason i understand the story is meant to be absurd but the characters were not realistic nor true to who they are portrayed to be  a sure sign of writing that leaves much to be desired there arent even highly quotable scenes because the dialogue is so littered with unoriginality this movie is not worth watching,black_comedy
what an endlessly inventive movie this is it supplies the audience a stream of dazzling inventions twists and wicked paradoxes rare is the movie where the last half hour surprises you just as much as the first and in ways youre not expecting the movie has ideas enough for half a dozen films but jonze and his cast handle them so surely that we never feel hard pressed were enchanted by one development after the nextbehind a filing cabinet on the 7 12th floor craig finds a small doorway he crawls through it and is whisked through some kind of temporalspatial portal ending up inside the brain of the actor john malkovich here he stays for exactly 15 minutes before falling from the sky next to the new jersey turnpikemalkovich himself is part of the magic he is not playing himself here but a version of his public imagedistant quiet droll as if musing about things that happened long ago and were only mildly interesting at the time it took some courage for him to take this role but it would have taken more courage to turn it downthe movie just keeps getting better i dont want to steal the surprises and punch lines even a charlie sheen cameo is inspired at one point malkovich enters himself through his own portal which is kind of like being pulled down into the black hole of your own personality and that trip results in one of the most peculiar single scenes ive ever seen in the movies every once in a long long while a movie comes along that is like no other a movie that creates a new world for us and uses it to produce wonderful things it stakes out a completely new place and colonizes it with limitless imagination,black_comedy
i knew nothing about spike jonze had not read the critical reviews and was not a fan of john malkovich prior to viewing this film i watch both mainstream and independent film and am critical of both i went to see it with a psychotherapist friend and we were both thoroughly enjoyed it if you are at all familiar with and appreciative of jungian psychology psychosynthesis drama therapy and surrealism there is a strong probability that you will get this film it also helps if you have a sense of fun and humour a willingness to suspend belief a love of creativity imagination and originality an understanding of the functioning of the human psyche and an attention span the introspective encounter with ones own internalized roles or subpersonalities was brilliantly and humorously portrayed in the film the love it or hate it reactions are not so surprising genius in art has often being reviled as witnessed for example in the reaction to the early impressionists if you do see this i can only hope that you enjoy it as much as i did,black_comedy
written by charlie kaufman  directed by spike jonze is brilliance personified an unbelievably innovative original film that entertains  inspires a gem from 1999synopsis a puppeteer discovers a portal that leads literally into the head of the movie star john malkovichis spike jonzes finest film after the recent masterpiece her he directs this ambitious tale of humanabsurdity with flourish kaufmans screenplay refuses to surrender to any clich whatsoever  delivers a sense of newness  madness to the narrative kaufmans screenplay blends humor  imagination most admirably cinematography is claustrophobic editing is crisp art deisgn  makeup are fabulous performancewise john cusack is in top form he enacts the failed puppeteer with great energy catherine keener is mesmerizing she delivers her finest performance in here cameron diaz is natural the core malkovich clearly projected as a caricature here has the most fun by enacting his part superbly orson bean is firstrate charlie sheen sparkles in a cameoon the whole is original crazy but unforgettable,black_comedy
i just keep laughing at the ratings either its a 1 or its a 10 i give it a 910 its an original movie with good acting a good script and good development at the beginning it starts slowly it can make you think why am i watching this but its truly worth it to keep watching it until the end this one became one of my favorite movies one of the things i like best is that its ending its not predictable you wont know whats going on until the endthe soundtrack its awesome too if you like instrumental music pay special attention to it,black_comedy
the idea of being able to experience all the senses of another person is a quite intriguing thought combine this with being able to be a celebrity is even better and in this case john malkovich being a mysterious and slightly odd guy but still an interesting and famous star provides an attractive juxtaposition easily drawing the attention from all parts of societyso the title and basic drawing factor of this film is well covered the characters remain constant and does not feel schizophrenic although they dont seem to develop either and none of the main characters are easily related to the film seems to try and center around the frailty of man but it fails to do so it rather succeeds in centering around a pathetic character in craig schwartz and his lustful obsession with maxine whom is just a truly rude and unrefined person and then focus shifts to the competition which the love lotte schwartz and maxine share provide to craigs pathetic attempts at keeping maxine all of this could have been forgiven if only the audience had been able to relate somehow to those that were in john malkovich but there were very little of being in john malkovich and the audience remained separated from the characters the main attraction of the story then did not deliver and this almost single handedly steered the film to the side of total disappointment the story really only accomplishes to cheapen the human condition and love it shows no sensitivity to what a life is and what separates lust from love so although things happen on screen the film seems to only accomplish the opposite of what the puppeteer attempted to express i almost want to call it a bad moral lesson,black_comedy
have you ever felt like there was more too life than simply whats available that sense of emptiness you feel its indescribable and you cant seem to find a way to fulfill that void many of us make that exact claim every single waking day whether were held back by physical obstacles or by our own minds its these restrictions that we often try to rationalize that keeps us from exceeding our expectations but what if you can erase those limitations start over again with a helping hand that is what effectively demonstrates is truly an aweinspiring film that desperately tries to define the blurred lines between fantasy and reality craig schwartz played by john cusack is a talented puppeteer who vicariously lives through his dolls until he is forced into the redundant lifestyle of the generic work culture however schwartz finds something to look forward to a female coworker that hooks him and infests his mind and soul ill skip forward to not spoil anything but schwartz comes across a wormhole that allows him to peak through the eyes of actor john malkovich realizing the possibilities that the wormhole possesses schwartz takes his opportunity to hijack malkovich and become him the film flies by at around 2 hours and does a consistent job at balancing the fine lines of fantasy comedy romance and drama overall is a head spinning selfreflecting piece of art that will peak your fascinations i came away asking more questions than i intended and thats what makes the film riveting although it may not be for everyone it righteously earns its cult praise and film achievements a must watch for all film enthusiasts,black_comedy
must surely rank as one of the most inventive original and yet daring films of the last ten years a metaphysical journey about the desire to transform oneself involving identity gender and creativity its silly unpredictable and completely faithful to its distinctive perverse vision a brilliant premise written by the charlie kaufman and masterfully directed by spike jonze a truly an ingenious film and considered a modern day classic craig schwartz john cusack is stuck in a frustrated rut in his life his pet obsessed wife lotte cameron diaz seems more concerned with providing a decent home to various animals as opposed to satisfying his marriage needs also money is drying up craigs dreams of becoming a worldfamous puppeteer appear to be eroding and he is pressured into finding a job because of his quick hands a skill necessary for artful puppetry craig applies for a job as a filing clerk his job requires him to work on the seventh and a half floor in a strange office block his days are spent trying to persuade the object of his attention maxine catherine keener into having an affair with him while losing a file behind a storage cabinet one day craig discovers a strange and murky tunnel hidden behind the cabinet crawling inside craig finds the tunnel to actually be a portal and the destination is inside the actor john malkovichs head although craig has no say with regards to malkovichs actions he can clearly witness and influence what the actor is doing fifteen minutes later craig is forced out of malkovichs head and dumped along side the new jersey turnpike part of the pleasure in watching john malkovich is seeing these actors at full creative throttle and knowing how much they relished the insanity of the script but its clearly malkovich who has the most fun here spoofing oneself is usually therapeutic but for malkovich whose reputation as an intellectual prima donna must have been ecstatic at an incredibly unique opportunity without spoiling what follows features a fine cast of dryly comic actors who are very much in on the joke that can even be said of charlie sheen who turns up for some wicked selfparody in a film that also features cameo appearances by sean penn brad pitt doesnt bog down in allegories while remaining tremendously entertaining and thought provoking and definitely worthy of repeat viewings fantastic performances all around by the entire cast but especially by cusack and malkovich nominated for three academy awards,black_comedy
it seems to me that john malkovich needed his name out there cause no one really knew who he was even after winning two oscars so he wrote a pretty good storyline around his stage persona of course he wouldnt say it was his idea so they said someone else wrote it thinking about him yeah rightthe storyline is pretty good though lots of turns you wont expect the acting photography and editing are great im not sure the writers where really heading somewhere  or where just toying with the idea of being in someone elses mind ego superego id while trying to be as outrageous as possible my bet is they where doing the second one anyway this is a must see and john malkovich did achieve what he wanted now everyone knows his name,black_comedy
alternating between quirky drab conceptual and surreal this fantasy whatif doesnt even march to the beat of any drummer in the classical sense john cusack and cameron diaz are unrecognizably pedestrian as a mismatched husband and wife at the end of their rope both after the same thing in spite of one another their marriage and the factors that lead to its quick sad disintegration may be the traditional center of the story but along the way the plot jolts in so many wildly different directions that its actually rendered secondary like a journey through the mind of a creative genius with serious add it samples a dozen concepts strong enough to power their own film then still finds a way to somehow marry them all into a single adventurous mostly coherent finale unclassifiable in the very best way its not something i could watch more than once every four or five years,black_comedy
there are many strange films out there that push the idea of what narrative can be but of those that i have seen few can compare with the strangely original story of putting together several bizarre events and story elements it takes the usual linear narrative structure and confuses it by jumping through time and frequently changing the positions of characters to keep the ending so distinctly uncertain its hard to imagine what one is waiting for while watching the film brilliantly suspenseful oddly funny and strangely philosophical though what this particular philosophy might be is as obscure as anything else in the film this movie is an odd twist of the typical linear structure of narrative rather than reinventing narrative style to find its unique feel it confuses audience expectations and makes the plot as confusing as the most oddly told stories but in the most inventive and interesting way,black_comedy
i saw this movie few days ago over 10 years after it came out for the big world how could i miss it for so long i am not good at making reviews yet i would make the review for this one seems so simple and marketed as a comedy  no idea why it aint no comedy more it is not funny that much of course you laugh sometimes but if you watched carefully it becomes more dark and dark as you go deeper into the forest this movie is about life about choosing path about condition of mankind about being yourself about hundred other things that are important in life did you think american beauty was about choosing the right path so you were right but only to some extent just watch and you maybe as it not that obvious  grasp the true meaning of life i mean it  this movie opened my eyes wider than 100 movies before of course it is just a movie you wont be millionaire after watching it but well youll get what i mean soonnot to mention fantastic screenplay so original and fresh ive not come for a screenplay like this before ever maybe truman show being that original hit me as well that much but its different of courseif you desire from a movie something more intellectual than average 15 hrs  pick if you like to ask questions  go even more with it you will not regret it,black_comedy
announced the arrival of charlie kaufman as a major new talent among screenwriters and though ive been resistant to much of his work including this film i cant deny that hes certainly established himself as a presenceis a case of a film being too clever for its own good the premise is a hoot  a nerdy dude john cusack discovers a portal that allows those who pass through it to live inside john malkovichs head for a while his mousy wife cameron diaz and newfound fling a fetching catherine keener want in on the action too until word is out and theres a virtual stampede of people wanting to be malkovichthe film is nothing if not original and its engaging to a point but the screenplay gets ahead of kaufman and the whole thing spins out of controlmalkovich plays himself and gives a performance so grotesque that it was almost unwatchable for megrade b,black_comedy
it is very possible that cinema will never be able to find a writer like charlie kaufman again and if it does it will be someone too similar to him kaufman knows no limits knows no endings believe me his scripts would never end if he could take that decision and thinks as a screenwriter in creating material that at the end of the day is purely cinematographic luckily hes always found apt directors to bring his words to life michel gondry and spike jonze sorry george clooney doesnt count because kaufmans script for the actordirectors first film is adaptedin kaufmans imagination takes flight and images go right along flying with it its not the writers intention to arouse questions of philosophical even metaphysical nature theres a scene in which craig john cusack the films main character explains maxine catherine keener about a portal he found that leads him to john malkovichs head he tells her he went into the portal with a piece of wood and came back without it and because hes strangely in love with her he tries to impress her by making a speech about how this may change his lifeit is in that speech that craig asks one after another philosophical questions that are a clear joke fact thats evidently seen because maxine is laughing at him the poor guy a puppeteer hasnt been able to impress her and goes back home to make a puppet of himself and maxine only to recreate an impossible sexual encounter at home craigs awaited by his wife lotte cameron diaz some kind of veterinarian or pet lover who keeps a dog a parrot a chimp and who knows what else inside the housecharacter development is perfect maxine is cold disinterested unimpressed and at the same time mysterious an office femme fatale that keener portrays perfectly craig is an insecure depraved depressive almost sick artist and his wife is very much like him each cusack and diaz probably deliver their best performances what kaufman does is develop a classic tragic love triangle an puts john malkovich in the middle as a the connection between the three players a vehicle for the realization of their passionsit could have been any other person but the fact that the actor is famous works as a plot device for something crucial and that is people paying to be john malkovich for fifteen minutes so theres no philosophical meditation in just a gifted screenwriter messing with himself and automatically messing with our minds too this means of course that theres a moment where everything kind of goes to hell but were able to accept itif you would care to look for a subject though it would be more psychological theres a lot in the film that kaufman later took to each one of his scripts things that mentioned separately are scarier than the amusing visual rides directors make us experience sexual obsession childhood memories and some other things that are hidden in the subconscious its delirious but in one scene we even see a close up of a chimp that a second later is remembering the most tragic experience of his childhood,black_comedy
is one of the most original movies ever made charlie kaufman takes risk after risk with his screenplay and completely ignores any and all screen writing protocol the beauty of this movie is that it doesnt try to hammer home a point like godard or hanekes movies rather it is an objective exploration of themes that all resonate with us at some point or another the selfesteem of craig is a major theme he feels awkward as himself but when he becomes john malkovich he feels he can achieve anything the feeling of wanting to be someone else especially that of a celebrity is something we all have gone through at some point everyone wishes that the film doesnt seem to suggest that is right or wrong but it explores what happens if it really did kaufmans bizarre script has some very imaginative ideas it seems like a fairy tale his visual ideas are unfiltered it seems as if kaufman allows everything from his brain to be put onto paper strange fantasies and hopes and ideas that most keep hidden in the back of their mind kaufman lets us know we are not alone many people have confusion over their sexuality and lotte craigs wife is a clear example of that she falls in love with another woman through the film is a great achievement at showing us relationships in a different package we have seen the typical marriage problems in film over and over again but shows us an odd but fresh new marriage with problems of wanting to be other people and with other people,black_comedy
is a difficult film to describe in it a puppeteerturnedofficeworker discovers a door in his office that leads into the mind of actor john malkovich from that launching pad screenwriter charlie kaufman takes us on a ride that is nothing if not originalthe cast turns out to be a pretty good one even though im usually not much of a fan of john cusack or cameron diaz catherine keener is the real standout though as her oscar nomination shows john malkovich is also a good sport in the role he was born to playive mentioned the films striking originality this proves to be a doubleedged sword while the bizarre premise makes this a film like no other the equally bizarre romances that result are somewhat difficult to relate to so while its entertaining to watch theres a certain amount of emotional detachment which for me knocks the film down a notchits worth noting that charlie kaufman nabbed the first of so far three oscar nominations for his screenplay director spike jonze was also honored with an oscar nomination though i dont think that i would have singled him out the film is generally well made though with a mostly dreary look that suits the material but is unlikely to turn any headsif youre looking for something truly original this film fits the bill it certainly wont be to everybodys taste but its worth watching to find out if it suits yours,black_comedy
completely original but blatantly violating the basic laws of film making is a movie that invites you to laugh at its absurdity i have no complaints with the plot in fact it comes along as refreshing and arouses anticipation of anyone who bothers to read the movie synopsis before watching a film a surreal concept which a portal to someones brain is requires that similar treatment in the movie yet the portal is almost dismissed in the movie as being nothing more than commonplace and mundane to see the director overlooking the essence of fantasy and instead weave a story on its fringe is sad because as viewers you are left salivating for the meaty substance that never comes the acting is mediocre and the scenes are patched together many times instead of a coherent narrative the film expects to sell on novelty but so many of natural consequences arising from an imaginative plot the film is humorous at times but overall feels like the director felt like he had a great idea and decided to sell that instead of making a film around it,black_comedy
when we talk about bad movies we often say that they are so because they are weird strange or because they dont make any sense at all but is just too much weird and too much complicated to be rated as a bad moviejohn cusack stars as craig schwartz a struggling puppeteer who lives with a dog a talking parrot a chimpanzee and an almost unrecognizable cameron diaz as his wifecraig badly needs money so he takes a job as a filing clerk and he works for a new york firm located on the seventhandahalf floor of a manhattan buildingthings just get even stranger when craig discovers a secret tiny doorway that leads him directly into the mind of actor john malkovich played by john malkovich after having lived a quarter of hour into malkovichs head craig is ejected from it and mysteriously finds himself on the side of the new jersey turnpike just outside new york citycraig and his new colleague maxine catherine keener have the idea of making people who want to live the same experience pay for it so craig and maxine rent malkovichs mind fifteen minutes at a time and people become a famous hollywood actor for that amount of timeis directed by spike jonze better known for his numerous music videos and masterfully written by charlie kaufman his screenplay is brilliant and of an almost unreached level of originality and perfectly allies surrealism and the philosophy of mindjonze evidently does a great job in the directors chair with some astonishing and breathtaking moments unfortunately for him kaufman is the real star of this movie and so is his simply unreal and completely crazy story at some moments we could find ourselves wondering what does kaufman have in his mind if he didnt simply put his brain on autopilot and went on a wave of automatic writingonly a few examples are enough to illustrate my point of view first of all we get to know that craigs wife works in a pet store but is it a good reason to keep a dog a talking parrot and a chimpanzee named elijah in their apartment and then we get to wonder how can people work on the seventhandahalf floor of a building and when we finally get the rational explanation we wonder why we asked that question instead of shutting upand the characters we get to meet are not any more normal the first example is the secretary who interprets every word wrong then craigs new boss dr lester who is 105yearold and who drinks almost exclusively carrot juice which explains why he pisses orangebut except the surrealist moments the movie is also one of the most thoughtprovoking and philosophical motion pictures of the recent years actually 1999 seems to be the year of philosophy in hollywood with the releases of john malkovich the matrix and fight clubthe film cleverly plays with the themes of identity celebrity and the bodysoul union is living for a moment as a famous person is worth it is it legitimate and if it was really possible would there be a real danger of playing with a person like the characters of the movie do is an intellectual comedy drama unlike any other and the first term is the most important of the three with such a mix of surrealism and philosophy its definitely not a movie for the weak minds you have to love these two things and complicated stories as well or else youre gonna quit on this movie about halfway throughand the most controversial aspect of the film is the relationship between maxine and cameron diaz as long as the events pass there are moments that are gonna put some people away if they are not instantly outraged andor scandalizedwith everything ive said about the movie theres only one adequate way to describe it  its a movie that takes chances and this attitude gets rewarded by the viewers admiration and amazementi perfectly understand that its not everybody whos gonna love but i believe that its a movie that deserves to be watched not necessarily loved but watched for sure because we have to salute the originality the eccentricity and the vision of every artist involved into this projectis one of the rare proofs that we can both stimulate our mind and our moralities by watching hollywood actors and this fact is enough for us to appreciate the movie as a whole,black_comedy
this film is just magnificent it has many different themes and makes that you can find so many different ways to enjoy it it may be seen as a portrait of a relationship work and love but most notorious as a portrait of the human mind in the end is a science fiction film that uses that to make a better study of the mind upon an amazingly original story full of creativitythat story begins with craig schwartz john cusack a great puppeteer who has no luck and no work lotte cameron diaz is his wife who loves pets having many of them in their house as i write craigs abilities as a puppeteer were really good but that wasnt enough to obtain a job so he decides to take a job as filing clerk when craig enters for the first time in the 7 floor of the building where he will work we start to feel that this is going to be really weird even that may be a reasonable explanation of why they made a floor between the 7th and the 8th floors is just so bizarre and really hilarious to watch a floor in which the employees cannot stand upright maxine catherine keener works there too and soon will be the love desire of craig also we meet lester orson bean the new boss of craig who only talks about his wet dreamsso we have this four main characters whose personalities will be different after craig discover a portal here is when the weird story written by charlie kaufman really begins with this portal that can take you to the mind of john malkovich so for 15 minutes you can be witness of what this actor do through his eyes upon that we have a really interesting view to the different behaviour of craig lotte and maxine after they know about the portal craig only thinks in the human mind and many philosophicaltype questions maxine looks this portal just as a business and lotte is the first one who feels a sort of addiction to that experience finding through malkovich the man inside her here the film is hilarious having a couple craig and lotte in love with the same woman maxine lotte and maxine will find a connection between them but only when lotte is inside malkovich and because malkovich is just so innocent well he doesnt care if maxine call him lotte suddenly the film turns even weirder and more interesting when malkovich is no longer malkovich in consequence of having a puppeteer inside his mind finally craig can be near maxine who is still a very strange character being just taking advantage of the circumstances the end is nothing but brilliant with the real plans of lester maxine having a normal life with lotte and with the eternal life as a possible thing leaving malkovich just as another victim and craig completely lostabout the cast everybody here did just a terrific work even that im not a fan of john cusack i loved his performance as a confused puppeteer with a big obsession the beautiful cameron diaz looks really different in the first part of the film and she is just great i will always recognize catherine keener because of the film living in oblivion and here is terrific in a very strange character john malkovich as himself is fantastic first is just fun but later he end being a victim in this cruel but brilliant conclusion and my favourite cameo is the one of charlie sheen giving advices to malkovich about hot lesbian witches just hilarious as his new look after seven years also sean penn is in the film talking in the tv show about the new phase of malkovich as a puppeteerconclusion hilarious interesting moving entertaining and so damn unique it is fantastic how spike jonze and charlie kaufman more specific the last one created a unique and bizarre world with those surrealistic and weird situations and upon that they created a very human story showing how we find irresistible to prove how does it feels to be someone else in this case a person with fame and also how this persons left everything of course including their own personalities to get some fame or to be young again a really interesting portrait of the human mind so for me is nothing but another reason to remember the year 1999 as a wonderful year for cinema what a great film this isregion 4 dvd another great singledisc release by universal pictures it contains many extras and a very original menu some of the extras are the trailer four imaginative and funny tv spots the complete videos of the story of the 7 and the story of the new john malkovich in the film both videos are seen on tv the art of puppeteering spikes photo album and some others the interview with spike jonze is definitely unique but actually he doesnt answer any question anyway watching this film on this terrific dvd just left me a lot of desires to get the dvd of adaptation 2002 as soon as i can,black_comedy
i first saw this film while in college i wasnt much of a critic thenperhaps not now either and was mostly in to the action flicks where acting and content fell second or third this film struck me as an oddity of anything i had previously seen and most of that is not due to the concept and plot but the original execution different is good thought provoking is good the idea of being john malcovich or anyone else celebrity or not is of course no new idea to anyone the execution this film has to offer the acting the philosophical theological and idealogical inferencesboth divulged in the diologue and those indirect allows the viewer for much conversation after the film endsthis film practically changed my film genre preference for myself its one of those films that i show to friends for their personal reactions and as stated provides good some good post film conversation if anyone is in for a psychological ride put this at the top of your to watch list 910 td,black_comedy
bizarre is the one word to sums up this film the protagonists include a puppeteer  an actor playing himself which must be a firsti have never seen anything like it yet strangely it does work for such a strange film it is not pretentious  can be enjoyed without having to think about too muchall the cast are great  with cameron diaz dressing down it took me 30 minutes before i realised she was in the filmthe plot does seem to unravel towards the end but i prefer to applaud the effort of trying something different which mostly works one of my favouritesif you like your movies to be predictable  have hollywood endings then this is not for you,black_comedy
yes it is and if you want to watch this movie and understand it you have to be in a good mood because this stuff is really good and it touchs your personality very deep inside body and mindspike jonze is one great film director no wonder why he got the oscar nomination he portrayed with the brilliant writer charlie kaufman the personality of john malkovich as some thing you can feel as if it was a car you can ride or a shirt you can wear that bizarre idea blew my mindthe acting was great and i liked cameron diaz in particular for me she deserved an oscar nomination she was simply sensationalbut after all its not very complex i received the message immediately after the movie and it said dont be john malkovich or any one else just be your self,black_comedy
how would i describe being john malcovich strangely normal however given the same question regarding jonze and kaufmans work id say the exact same thing having only just seen the film for a second time this evening i cant say that i fully understand the movie at this point but nevertheless can appreciate the work as a piece of film rather than interpretive arti enjoyed almost everything about the film from its surreal plot its dark humour and its gorgeous photography the actors also give absolutely wonderful performances injecting unforgettable energy into their characters brining them to life effectively throughout perhaps what works best in the films advantage is its originality and imagination which combine right from the beginning to create a world that always feels familiar yet also remains fantasticalthe only real problem i have with the film is its sometimes slow pace that gets the story caught up in unimportant scenes with little importance fortunately however being john malcovich for the majority of the time never lets the attention go and will have you in its grasp long after it ends,black_comedy
i personally love all films that go beyond into the depths of surrealism personally because i think film is the best medium for portraying such a movement  think david lynch or michael gondry but this one called out at a personal time of thinking about the idea of self and habitual existence but that is the most pointless thing to talk about whilst talking about a film and this film stepped from being quirky sundance gumption to a deep exploration of freudian psychology for example look at lottes naive realisation of her lesbianism whilst experiencing the male psyche which is a classic freudian ideal if in a surreal and weird way and how our mind is our self personally i think this is kaufmans argument against god rather than for it we do not have predetermined personalities thus ruling out some possibilities for gods power in itself thus sprache zarathustra and all thatso it is a deep film in that respectbut god is it hilarious,black_comedy
craig a puppeteer takes a filing job in a lowceilinged office in manhattan although married to the slightly askew lotte he hits on a colleague the sexually frank maxine shes bored but snaps awake when he finds a portal leading inside john malkovich for 15 minutes you see hear and feel whatever jm is doing then you fall out by the new jersey turnpikethis movie is filled with originality what the movie gives you is thought provoking and in the middle of the movie it makes a surprising turn offering us more twists yeah this wont be a mainstream film but really people go see it watch something different from charlie kaufmans twisted mindi liked the acting by john cusack and catherine keener but cameron diaz a lot more because she acts really different and unrecognizable from the naked eye in one point of the movie i like to praise for its cinematography where we could feast our eyes onthis movie is interesting and sometimes really funny its offers something different for the silver screen and its really original this is one of the best films ever made,black_comedy
was one of the most bizarre films to ever emerge from the 90s its completely off the wall its really out there and it seems to exist in a world parallel to our own its also one of the most original intelligent and funniest of films ive ever seenconsider this a struggling puppeteer craig schwartz john cusack works as a file clerk in an office that looks like the designers had the munchkins from the wizard of oz in mind when they created it the office is so tiny you have to crane your head sideways to walk about craig discovers a tiny door behind a filing cabinet and like alice down the rabbit hole when he goes through it he emerges into a fantasy land or to be more precise inside the body of the actor john malkovich seeing the world through his eyes for 15 minutes at a time before being spat out next to the new jersey turnpikewhat follows is a dizzying journey of identity crises power trips and lots and lots of wackiness i dont know when writer charlie kaufman dreamt up this joyous gem of a film or how director spike jonze ever convinced alist stars cameron diaz john cusack charlie sheen in a wonderful cameo and most importantly malkovich himself to play along but youre glad they saw the genius in it this is a truly extraordinary filmmust qualify as the quirkiest comedy to hit cinema screens since groundhog day in fact the more i compare them the more alike they seem they both flow from a central conceit and we just sit back and watch the different possibilities that are opened up and jonze is completely engaged with the material right from the moment craig discovers that portal into malkovichs headas you watch the film it slowly draws you into this oddball situation and somehow makes it all seem strangely plausible craig being a puppeteer is understandably enthused when he finds out that not only can he observe the world through john malkovich he can exert control over him too and isnt that one of the greatest fantasies of our time the opportunity to be a celebrity even if its only for a brief time and bask in the privileges it presentsthe one question surely on all our minds iswhy john malkovich what makes him so special of all the people in the world why was he singled out for this honour maybe because hes not an obvious choice john malkovich is a fine actor and always puts in superb performances no matter what material hes asked to work with but hes not quite the superstar say tom hanks is or tom cruise the fact that hes a little off the radar in real life makes him ideally castwe get to see him do simple ordinary workings of everyday life such as eating toast taking a shower even checking his reflection you wouldnt think such ordinary tasks would make for compelling viewing but sometimes even the most ordinary gestures can be as absorbing as the greatest actinganother thing of continual delights is the wonderful screenplay kaufman has put at our disposal he manages to get some extraordinary mileage out of it perhaps because is a comedy of ideas and the ideas just keep getting cleverer and clevereri love it when craig and maxine a delightfully vampish catherine keener a woman he lusts for who keeps peeling him off her shoe opens up jm inc where people are invited to inhabit malkovich for 200 a pop or when lotte an astonishingly drab cameron diaz craigs wife enjoys so much she develops feelings for maxine too maxine is having sex with malkovich at the time confused yetthe acting is super all over diaz and keener are two sides of the same coin they both love each other but only as malkovich cusack is a brilliantly dippy drip and charlie sheen puts in a fantastic selfeffacing cameo as malkovichs friend but of course the real star here is malkovich himselfthis surely must count as the finest performance of his career and hes playing himself its a great star turn on his part and shows off his real versatility as an actor the poor bewildered malkovich not only has to contend with people walking around his head without his knowledge but has to contend with them taking over his body too the way he captures cusacks mannerisms is astonishing his puppet dance is a real show stopper but the crowning delight is the moment when he goes through that tiny door for himself and sees whats on the other side its a scene of inspired lunacy and showcases malkovichs talents and rangesome scenes are so surreal your head is spinning with the infinite possibilities bjm keeps dreaming up lotte chasing maxine through the maze of malkovichs subconscious is so conceptually dazzling it recalls the brilliance of the extraordinarily loopy eternal sunshine of the spotless mind also penned by kaufman talented manstands out as one of the finest comedies of the 90s its not nearly as complicated as it sounds an accessible incredibly heady experience so rewarding you almost wish there really were portals into other peoples headsquite brilliant,black_comedy
i just picked this up out the 1 vhs closeouts i can think of a lot worse movies but this one was pretty awful the beginning was all right and drew me in with the ludicrous tunnel idea the people lining up to pay 200 to enter the tunnel were pretty funny as was the cash box  like a carnival ride but for the last hour the lightness disappears the film turns vicious preachy and mechanical malkovich and cusack become villainous white males and are set up like wooden puppets to take a predictable feminist hit on top of this a subplot involving living forever by invading another persons mind kicks in mind travel as a carnival ride is exhilarating  mind travel as a way to live forever is a cheesy science fictionphilosophy lecture what started out as an innovative film ended up pretty flat its heartening to see that it didnt receive any academy awardsi guess it was worth the 1 just to satisfy my curiosity it wont be staying around here for another viewing though its not in the same class with ed wood holiday inn flamingo kid night of the lepus or even super dave begone ye to yon thrift shoppe,black_comedy
according to the surrealistic background characters act absurd and logical in one above all is a layer of cynical decadence with its own corresponding moral by coincidence a nameless puppeteer finds a secret door into the brain of john malkovich so he leaves his wooden puppets behind and plays the human puppet malkovich but he cannot keep the secret more and more narrowminded characters jump into the broadminded deprived character malkovich starting as stalkers and ending up somewhat different this happens in rhythmic alteration the whole process being slightly but not to much commercialized a highlight is the man malkovich multiplying himself by jumping into himself after having found out what is going on within himself malkovich becomes well used and abused well used by the two women  one of them being in malkovich for this purpose  to create a daughter and abused by the puppeteer riding him and mutating the famous actor into the famous puppeteer malkovich according to its own morality the movie comes to a corresponding happy end the abuse of the brain malkovich will be terminated finally the nameless puppeteer will be forced to leave it instead malkovich serves further on deliberately as a vessel brain for a circle of elder people thus preventing them from death this is combined with the perspective to settle down in the created daughters brain when the time has come,black_comedy
i really enjoyed this movie it was kind of weird but i thought it was pretty good if you saw john malkovich in any of his other movies and you enjoyed them then i think you will like this movie its really funny too its not a movie that you would want the kids to see but if you like john malkovich john cusack and cameron diaz then you will enjoy this movie they all do a fantastic job especially cameron diaz as she had to play a bisexual john malkovich did a great job as well the cute thing about this movie is that john cusack and cameron diaz are married and they own a monkey i love monkeys i really thought that this movie should have won that oscar i was disappointed that it didnt win but im glad that it at least got a nomination,black_comedy
is fun and original it oozes creativity without being pretentious i found myself grinning throughout even in the dark scenes which only happens when i really connect with a filmas much fun as i had watching this film however my comments will focus primarily upon the ideas i believe kaufman was trying to illustrate because i cannot accept that this movie was intended solely as a wild thoughtless ride for the audience through the many visits inside the head of malkovich kaufman is inviting us to explore our own minds which most of us do not like to do the question this film can lead us toward is whether or not we are like its characters so many of the characters like craig and his wife and all the people who line up to be john malkovich are portrayed as pathetic they show how most people are truly unhealthy and unsatisfied we often feel lost and are secretly more than willing to control others if it will help us fulfill our desires and if we cant get what we want through controlling others we can try to get it through our fantasiesor by living through other people i dont think this film is about our longing to be another specific person so much as it is about our longing to escape our own sad lives we often wish to escape our destiny or even our mortalityof course some people spend more time longing for a different life than others maxines role in the film is to show us someone who is selfassured and her strength sets her apart from the rest of us who often feel insecure and unsettled her beauty and confidence is what we want the struggle at the heart of the film is whether we are capable of recognizing our shortcomings and then either accepting them or making the changes necessary to overcome them most of us can do neither and end up like craig continually trying to live through othersso the question is are you more of a craig or a maxine and dont just focus on who youd like to be,black_comedy
its about a puppeteer who finds a portal into the head of a reallife actor no its about an oversexed 105yearold pirate who runs a company on the 7  floor of a building who has found a way to live forever no its about a woman who realizes she is transsexual after having sex with her lesbian lover whilst inhabiting the body of john malkovich okay i give upi plead the charlie kaufman defenselike 2001 a space odyssey like brazil like a clockwork orange is like nothing else in filmdom for originality alone it deserves the highest accolades like its eponymous subject matter it is inexplicable and indefinabletranscending its own marginally sane storyline penned by that maniac charlie kaufman this movie stuns us with its audacity has there ever been a puppeteer as movie hero when was the last time action took place on the 7  floor of an office building have characters ever spoken plain english to a secretary only to have her accuse them  in english  of speaking gibberish have we ever met such a lovable grandpa character with such a liltingly filthy mouth my spunk is to you manna from heaven and the grandest audacity of all is the plot line of the puppeteer finding a tiny hidden door in his office which turns out to be a portal into the head of john malkovich dont ask i cant explain enter the portal and for fifteen minutes you see what malkovich sees hear what malkovich hears experience what malkovich experiences basically a passive passenger onboard the malkovich train  until the puppeteer finds a way to manipulate malkovich like a human puppet brought to the weird screen by director spike jonze malkovich stars john cusack as the puppeteer craig schwartz cameron diaz in an actual thinking speaking acting role as his wife lotte catherine keener as the glibly aloof maxine overplaying her arrogance as usual i would sincerely hate to be the guy keener comes home to every night orson bean as the lovable old lech lester mary kay place as his befuddled secretary whose naked thighs he wants to feel next to his and of course john malkovich  or is it comporting himself in that slightly askew manner that can only lead us to believe he is a closet knifekiller john malkovich proves to be quite the sport when it comes to selfdeprecation skewering himself as thoroughly as the movie skewers him he does such an exemplary job of acting as if other people were inhabiting him that we truly forget it is he himself who is calling himself an overrated hack or lamenting that he should have found a younger body to inhabit for fear of breaking a hip jonze and kaufman bend storytelling convention so far backwards so successfully that  like 2001 like brazil like orange  we could never guess at what might be coming next in this sui generis tale  which is as satisfying in its own way as any leftturn plot twistthe bizarre intertwining between maxine and lotte and craigasmalkovich will not support a simple hollywood solution and commendably there is no sappy ending with a heterosexual couple finally together after enduring adversity another portal has opened another soul is diluted and carter burwells sad evocative score shadows a tragic disturbing conclusionmalkovich is a balancing act between comedy and pathos the ongoing reference to that jewel thief movie which malkovich is constantly accused of acting in against his denials the sudden cameo of a wellknown hollywood roisterer as malkovichs confidante a funny little backstory involving lottes chimp elijah cusack as the tragic unappreciated puppeteer walking a line which could have easily led an audience to regard him without pity  as a ballless amoral cur who had to inhabit someone else to realize his own potential  yet he somehow evokes our sympathies through his pathetic attempts at progress there is also the unexplored allusion to sublimated personalities and possessionand what happens when malkovich enters the portal himself that faithful reader is too malkovich for mere words to malkovichmovie maniacs visit poffysmoviemaniacom,black_comedy
this is a wonderful and truly strange film and perhaps the strangest thing about it is that it got made at all given todays hollywood film system the story concerns an unhappilymarried unsuccessful puppeteer played by john cusack who discovers a hole behind a filing cabinet in an office block which leads into the actual reallife american actor john malkovich those who go down this hole are then transported into malkovichs identity andor brain its difficult to explain it exactly unless one has seen the film for a few minutes and then dropped out onto a nearby highway youd think that this would be enough to guarantee a film of tremendous originality but there is so much more weirdness and imagination in this film that ones interest is sustained throughout for example the floor of the office in which this hole is discovered was deliberately built for midgets so that anybody of normal height has to bend over to avoid hitting their head on the ceiling the reason for this is explained to the puppeteer who lands a filing job there in a short film for new recruits although we and they are none the wiser after seeing it eventually malkovich himself ends up going down the hole resulting in one of the most bizarre and disturbing and funny moments i have seen in a film what he encounters is a world or at least a restaurant populated entirely by john malkovichs men women babies this could so easily have been a completely pretentious and confusing shambles of a film but the director the brilliant spike jonze handles things with such focus and style that one is eased comfortably into the semifictional universe presented i think what make the film work is that it manages to be both surreal and very ordinary at the same time some of the lead characters are deliberately rather shabby and dull in their appearance cameron diaz in particular and the scenes in which we the audience see the pointofview of whoever is inhabiting malkovich are very mundane and strangely touching i found such as washing up ordering crockery over the phone or eating toast the whole visual style of the film is very drab and slightly underlit which serves to emphasise the far more bizarre aspects of the actual story credit must also go to charlie kauffman who wrote the screenplay wonderful stuff,black_comedy
being john malkovichwhile i was working at my animated project with my two characters of wood it happened i started watching the movie   attracted by the reality of the puppets and their movements the strongest part of the movie which i considered the best was the part in which the puppet turns towards puppeteer as a creation towards his creator another part of the movie that caught my eye was the show of human sized puppets i dont really know if it was real or not but it could be interesting to see a show with puppets and actors in which to be unable to make the difference between the real actor and puppetit could be interesting another ideas which i considered genius are  the introduction of the seventh and half floor a floor at half the size of an original floor but also the hole which leads inside malkovichs mindpart in which malkovich enters inside his own mind entering inside of malkovich world and also the pleasure with which the puppeteer plays with his own puppets the fact that he was living through themit was not an spectatorit was an accomplice to what was happening between puppets  what i understood from this movie is that you need to be yourself the way in which this was presented is genial for a long time i didnt see a movie so goodto be so impressed on one discussion with my colleagues about movie at my surprise i found out that john malkovich didnt write the script of this movie but someone introduced it to him and he was impressed of it and agreed to play in this movie about himthis seemed very strangebecause many timesartists get upset when someone tries to characterise them or something like thatseems that malkovich is special from this point of view the actors have played their roles goodbut something else what happened to me after watching this movie was that i could not remember anybodys name they just all seemed familiar including john malkovichalso from my discussion with my colleagues after watching the movie i understood that it happened to some of them the same thingthe movie being intentionally with actors of this typewhich everybody knows thembut nobody remembers their namejohn malkovich being one of themin conclusion i enjoyed the moviebeing john malkovichit is a well created moviestarting with the ideascenarioactorschromatic and the list could go onfor a long time i havent seen such a good movieit was an enjoyable experience watching this moviethis comment is by radu m s,black_comedy
i am just a regular guy who so happens loves it to watch movies and this movie blew me away in all sorts of ways the story the actingthe way john malkovich is being put in this movie it is pure brilliance cameron diaz looks unrecognizable and catherine keener plays well too john malkovich is fantastic in it john cusack also i dont want to give anything of the story away because it will ruin the experience but this is one of those must sees if you are into movies like donnie darko eternal sunshine of the spotless mind or the big lebowski there are so many disappointing movies out there if you are looking for something different a little bit more intelligence but also pure fun see this movierealkane,black_comedy

why is it that in the uk this gets a rating of 15 and in the us an r the 11 year old kids in norway seem to be able to watch it alongside 13yearolds from spain if howard stern could read this he would have a fit why are these films censored the way they are granted there is a lot of swearing and nudity etc but its content doesnt seem to dictate something harmful there isnt a lot of swearing for swearing sake it is an interesting story akin to the twilite zone im wondering how far the religious right have infiltrated the minds of americans where they arent allowed to make better decisions for themselves a rating sets a legal restriction that a parent has full right all the time to make for themselves why does the government need to pull the spring back on the windup dolls let them spin a bit let art reflect life and not edit itwhat would jesus do,black_comedy
this confusing and most bizarre film i have seen in a while by jonze who didnt impress me much with adaptation fails here as well i mean i like the idea but it was just too boring and not interesting to me the dialogues were a bit weak to me as well i didnt like the direction and although charlie kaufmans screenplay had a lot of potential i didnt like the outcome of this film not a good movie boring decent acting cusack was great keener was good too but film was too boring and pointless sucked i just didnt like it it didnt interest me overused the plot and was impossible trying to be too psychological and just uninteresting710,black_comedy
a frustrated puppeteer gets a new job in a building with a 712 floor where the ceilings are too low and everyone has to stoop down he finds a hidden entry hole in the wall and crawling in finds himself sucked into the head of actor john malkovich playing himself feeling  hearing everything the actor does after 15 minutes the puppeteer is suddenly spat out on the side of a new jersey road you would think it cant get any weirder than that but the story actually comes up with a plot to explain why all this is happening which may or may not be good  i sorta liked the mystery behind this odd stuff soon the puppeteer cusack his strange wife and a cold fish coworker keener hatch a plan to charge people 200 a pop for spending 15 minutes inside malkovichs head it always comes back to plain old capitalism dont it the story progresses on for further twists until it reaches the stature of an odd miniepic despite obviously being lowbudget the lighting in particular stinks in places tho this may be on purpose i can understand why this almost won the best screenplay oscar the makers took the potential of the premise as far as it can go but most mainstream viewers as ive read elsewhere will find this baffling what is the point what is it really all about well it may be worth the rental just to watch malkovich hamming it up as a sideways version of himself tripping on the twilightzonelike nature of the story and reinventing himself for the camera but i also see visions of writers holed up for a week writing nonstop taking the story in directions based on frantic brainstorming thats not bad but did we really need to know any of this this result,black_comedy
that was a good old film if you have never seen this i highly recommend watching it every detail of the film is so thought out this is an absolute masterpieceif you like eternal sunshine of a spotless mind you will like this its of a similar style probably because its the same writerit starts like what there are puppets then it come together then its like what but then comes together again but still the most weirdest film in the world the idea is laughable ha haits the most random thing in the world which when made so visual and unexpected makes me laugh it may not make you laugh but it made me laugh there are also other funny elements such as dialogue and some humorous events that are actually supposed to funnier than the idea itself which wasnt supposed to be hilarious but thats my kind of thinggood work to everyone who took part in making this,black_comedy
craig schwartz is a puppeteer who toils in obscurity adapting medieval love stories for streetcorner performances in the hope of making it big like that christo of puppet masters derek mantini then he stumbles onto a portal that leads him inside the mind of a reallife puppet none other than the famous screen actor john malkovichoh and he and his wife fall in love with the same woman who is carrying a baby thats also the only portal to future earthly existence for a dirty old man and his aging friendsis a highconcept comedy alright like craig the puppeteer it wants to raise issues in its askew way i see it as a meditation on selfishness puppetry being a metaphor for one imposing their will upon another craig selfishly throws his wife over for another woman his wife throws him over for the same woman and that woman is more selfish than the two put together of course none of them get what they want meanwhile the selfishness of the old man and his friends is homicidal since it involves the obliteration of another human being mind and soulwhatever the big idea it is welldeveloped with help from a cast that includes john cusack catherine keener and john malkovich who plays himself as well as cusacks craig schwartz when the latter is inside of him malkovich doing cusack doing malkovich is some fine actingwhile too highconcept to reach for its laughs doesnt forget to be funny the mertinflemmer early80s orientation film is as great a sendup of bad acting as inside amber waves was in boogie nights in addition to malkovich who is complemented warmly on his performance as that retard charlie sheen and sean penn have goofy cameos as themselves penn admitting he worries his own move into puppetry will be seen as slavish imitation of malkovich brad pitt throws in a single facial expression that slays meits also amusing how the film plays up the ordinariness of malkovichs life he doesnt do much more then eat toast and order periwinkle bathmats yet as craig sells people tickets inside malkovichs mind his customers emerge invariably joyous at the significance theyve experienced when craig completes his hostile takeover of malkovich he decides to remake the actor as a puppeteer and thus we are treated to a people magazine cover of a brooding malkovich and the headline i will act no more forever somehow i dont think that would happen in reality but of course playing with reality is where the fun is herecameron diaz is a real find in this film as she plays the frowsy wife in a style akin to louise lassers mary hartman while diazs roles often play off her incredible beauty alone is the one time she is called upon to really act and she pulls it off so much so it distracts from the fact her character is the most underwritten in the movie more of a gag than anything elsethe resolution of the story feels contrived as well not as amusing or coherent as the rest of the film though the ending itself is solid seeing craigs state in the end is a nice comment on his chosen career though he doesnt do as badly as poor johnone great thing about this movie is orson bean as the old man heres a guy i havent seen in 20 years and that was in a qtip commercial yet here he plays a central role and gets most of the laughs in a pretty funny film i dont want to be your link to history boy i want to feel my naked thighs next to floris is a big film about big ideas but it draws some of its biggest light from the smallest stars,black_comedy
 here be spoilers  craig schwartz cusack is a skilled puppeteer but that doesnt pay the bills he takes a strange job at a company located at the 7 floor in a building there he meets the attractive maxine keener and he gets two problems first he is attracted to this maxine but he is married to lotte diaz and second maxine is not at all attracted to him however when he discovers a secret door that leads straight into the mind of john malkovich they start a company that sells the experience naturally john malkovich gets confused and later not at all happy about it things complicate further when lotte falls in love with maxine maxine is attracted to lotte too but only when she is inside malkovich and then it gets really complicatedthis a extremely peculiar movie in a creative way ideas and scenes are presented in a new refreshing way thus making the story very entertaining the actors and actresses are good but somewhat overshadowed by the story i believe that this is the kind of movie that you either dislike or really enjoy and one must see for oneself i enjoyed though710,black_comedy
john malkovich being lewis carroll remember through the looking glass and down the rabbit hole and all the strange situations alice got into like rooms with low ceilings but this film lacks the charm of the literary classic written in the 19th century in fact it is a deplorable mess i am a malkovich fan he has done some of the finest work in theatre and film of the late 20th and early 21st centuries but this is a major misstep the puppets really marionettes with all their actions being controlled by someone else pulling the strings are supposed to be some sort of analogy for what happens to the real peoplewith someone else yanking them around but i wish we could have seen more of themthe marionettes that is and i thought the pet orangutan was good also,black_comedy
i must admit that is just not like being brad pitt or any other movie star and that adds all that weird touch the movie has because john is one of that weird kind of person he is a real characterbut what the movie really showed me was the fact of being someone else anybody else i mean and how can we get if we find the way to be that someone else no matter who that person might be how ridiculous do we become as if we are always prisoners of our own destiny how boring do we think our lives are that we are willing to give it all away just to be born again as someone new an supposedly better than us it is a funny movie and yes we can say a little strange but it is human nature in the most coarse expression and by the end those impossible dreams arrived in different ways for the different characters for some these dreams were real for others just an illusion but isnt that life,black_comedy
most reviews here try to dig too deeply into this movie it is supposed to be fun funny wildly imaginative and highly original are the best ways to describe it if youre looking for the meaning of life you will be disappointed if youre looking for an offbeat comedy with great dialogue and acting and something truly weird then this is the movie for you john cusacks boss is hysterical and his secretary is outrageous malkovich shows some real backbone allowing himself to be made fun of like this hes perfect in this movie and cusack is great too both he and diaz have some great comedic talent and great facial expressions this is the most original and flatout weird movie ive ever seen and i mean that all in the best way possiblei think too many people are looking at the weirdness and originality of this movie and thinking that it must have some deeper meaning that doesnt make sense to them well it really doesnt have any deeper meaning and those people are disappointed i watched this movie having no idea what it was about and as i watched it all i thought was this is so weird but its so funnywatch this movie for the purpose of pure entertainment and set your expectations correctly beforehand you wont be disappointed9 out of 10 stars,black_comedy
there are no words in the english language that could describe how i feel about this movie it just might be the most messed up movie i have ever seen wellmaybe not the fact that none of the characters in this movie are likable is what i disliked most about it cameron diaz plays a surprisingly unattractive woman john cusack plays a perverted and very desperate man who carves wooden dolls and lives his life through them what a creep in one scene he even makes as though he and another woman were making out using his wooden dolls of course i dunno its just kinda strange the only normal character in this whole movie is john malkovich dont watch it it is a big waist of time,black_comedy
hello finally it worked ive been reading almost every post for the last few months and i just wanted to join everyone in their discussionsbut at least im a member never seen a movie like this before me and my friends talked about all night pretty philosophical discussion i think i finally know what kind of movies a like does anyone know a similarmovie ow by the way you understand the movie i think lecter is indeed entering john malkovich with the other old men dont think too long about it the movie is just weird i think the real body of lecter had died a long time ago,black_comedy
the script by kaufman is very good and is full of imagination and creativity if ed wood would have done good movies this is what they would have looked likeit feels like something out of a very twisted dream and isnt the standard hollywood comedy even thought it is at times very dark its extremely funny all the time its nice to see a hollywood comedy thats not afraid of being dark and that skips the usual stereotypesthe acting is as well very good especially john cusack as the unemployed puppet master and i loved the bald charlie sheena must see movie,black_comedy
john cusack john malkovich catherine keenermaybe some spoilersi dont think ive ever seen a movie quite like the story is creative and unusual with a lot of unexpected twists it deals with a many number of things some are too unbelievable especially near the end when all is revealed about this secret door and maxine and lottes trip into malkovichs subconscious at first john cusack is in the spotlight then halfway through he becomes a secondary unpredictable character and the attention goes to malkovich and maxinecraig cusack is a deprived worn out puppeteer who gets a job in an office building with a particularly low ceiling where he discovers a small door that lets him see through the eyes of john malkovich which he uses to his own advantage elsewhere instead of trying to deal with the unrequited love for his workmate maxine he becomes slightly obsessive and keeps pursuing her he even locks up his wife in a cage thats right a cagejohn malkovich who knew most of the time malkovich is possessed by other people and completely clueless to what is going on until he discovers what is happening and goes into his own mind i never knew much of him until i saw this film and he was amazing i kept thinking is that his real voice he has quite a challenge not only does he have to play himself he has to take on other personalities such as craig and lottes when theyre him he does superb actingmaxine catherine keener is the money hungry workmate of craig craig becomes obsessed with her and turns his discovery into a small business lotte and malkovich himself also fall for her charms but maxine has another agenda by the end you see a different side of her you can see that she really cares for lotte and she changes for the bettercameron diaz plays in one of her early roles as lotte the selfconscious and timid wife of cusack she keeps pets in her house including a monkey to look at her you wouldnt think it was the same cameron in charlies angels but she is a less attractive hippy version she is another character like cusack who becomes unbalanced and bewildered by maxineis a breathtaking achievement and beautifully acted by all the cast some who went on to do much bigger things it leaves you with mixed thoughts and emotions and for some people confused if theyd have left out the immortality part with the old people it would have been better in my opinion but i love it its definitely worth a watch,black_comedy
thats what this movie is a study in outrageous surrealism yet managing to provide a coherent and relatively logical understandable and engaging story the ideas are completely zany and absolutely brilliant the acting is fabulous the dialogue is full of classic lines that you can laugh at again and again oh and the heartfelt lesbian lovestory doesnt make it worse i once loved cameron diaz esp in the mask but some of her later work made me revise my opinion about her in a negative direction i will say that here though she performs sensitively and admirably in every way catherine keener however gets my vote for most attractive character in this entire beautiful mess of screwy orderthis is a great movie right up there with the best of the best10 out of 10,black_comedy
i understand why i have had no grasp of this movie before seeing it its pretty difficult to describe without the film seeming ridiculous unfortunately after finally watching it im of the viewpoint that it is a ridiculous moviewhile i heard the eraserheadlike eerie soundtrack i was led to thinking of lynchs early film and wondered if whether would have been better had it gone the whole way as that film didinstead of going all out we are ultimately fed a banal story of manipulation and greed containg some truly unlikeable charactersthere are some interesting aspects of the movie but they drown in incredulity after a short whilereally is an odd bagatelle that has far too much status in my opinion,black_comedy
is it really needed to live through someone elses eyes to live through someone elses body to understand that luck and love is inside the mind and not on the outside the main purpose of this movie for me is that it shows that modern society makes people believe the outer of a human being is taking in a more important thing in life then a persons inner being what we have a depressed man cusack who cant find a jobbeing a puppeteer is like being nobody at least if u r a lowmiddle class average humanbeing like me and you reading this right now you dont count in this society if ur extraordinairy and not cool in someone elses mind this is the way swartch lives he meets a girl who he gets in love with he likes her but she doesnt show much interest because hes extraordinary not cool hes ugly hes a nobody then he escapes his own body and becomes another person john malkovich for 15 minutes he gets back to his own state and feels great great to feel what it is to be famous to be known to have a supposed great lifemovie goes onskipping parts he uses this to reach the inner mind of maximes through another persons body now he succeeds to get her attention although maxime doesnt know its him in john but still thinks its lotte the character of maxime shows well the way people think these days she loves the inner of craig schwartz and she loves the outer of john malkovich she is out to richness wealth fame all the things that make you supposingly happy these days without taking in regard that true happiness is inside and not on the outside a surrealistic film to think about not a masterpiece though more like a documentary how to live in a good way to understand that its not better being someone else but its better to be yourself people always find eachother no matter who you are 8510,black_comedy
id love to be able to pigeonhole this film but i cant  it really is that good  the basic premise  a portal in a filing room on the 7 and a half floor of an office building leads into john malkovichs head  is crazy surreal and weird  ok  this could never happen  but like craig the puppeteer and lottie his curly headed wife cameron diaz we slowly come to believe in it  well kind of  key to this is the participation of malkovich himself who at least shows he sees himself with some humour catty maxine proves a draw for the man and the woman visiting the portal which gives rise to all kinds of greeneyed situations and a knockout and extremely moving ending  to get from a to b is hilarious uneasy and unlike anything else youre like to see  work of genius,black_comedy
what can you say about this movie that has not been already said it is simply the most innnovative original movie of the last 10 years spike jonze is simply genius how could anybody come up with something genius,black_comedy
is one of the oddest and most brilliantly original comedies ever made  john cusack brilliant as the antihero is a depressed puppeteer who takes a job as a filing clerk in a very strange office  the surreal detail yet consistent atmospherics of cusacks life are bleakly rendered in a sublimely lowkey fashion then he discovers the strangest thing of all a portal into the head of actor john malkovich  the rest of the film is more silly than truly surreal and the tone more farcical but it never rests on its premise instead developing ever more layers and finally delivers an appropriately nightmarish finalein the vividness of its portrait of a grotesque world the film resembles delicatessan and not just because of the monkey  for sheer insane originality it brings to mind monty python the original sketch shows not the overrated movies which lack the coherence and depth of jonzes effort in terms of plot it resembles nothing  full marks to malkovich for staring in the film for which he surely now will ever after be known by,black_comedy
this is quite possible the most blissfully unique and weird film ever made this side of the atlantic ocean even if this head trip ultimately leaves you confused and bewildered how can you not have been entertained by a movie where the main character is a neurotic puppeteer people work at an office on the 7th 12 floor the ceilings and overhead are really low people who travel through john malcovichs head are unceremoniously dropped on the side of the new jersey turnpike we meet a chimp with post traumatic stress disorder and a woman with a phd in psycholinguistics who cant understand a word anybody says this film also gets kudos for the most creative use of a quasilesbian subplot ever conceived for film and dont worry this isnt just weird for weirdness sake and neither is the other joneskaufman collaboration adaptation a far more serious look at the horrors of imagination the creative process and the hollywood studio system fun smart clever weird and thought provoking pseudoabsurdestcomedydramas dont get any better than this,black_comedy
i really didnt know what to expect from this film it had such an insane concept i simply had to see it i cant say that i came out disappointed but the film was to say the least surprising i guess the films main pitfall is that its not very enjoyable the films gradual descent into insanity is probably too surreal for all tastes the acting is good for the most part john cusack gives an unformulaic but ultimately convincing performance cameron diaz was the most impressive out of the actors and gives her best performance yet i dont think that catherine keener deserved the oscar nomination she received she was above standard in her role but certainly not amazing im surprised that john malkovich would even agree to star in this film but he does a good job of playing himself cameron diaz and john cusack dont asktowards the end film gets much too inventive for its own good but one must admire the films strange and unique style slick direction and braveness to attempt such a strange concept its not as good as those other films films with daring concepts the truman show etc but its a nice try for what its worth and thats good enough its not as good as it should have been buts its a break from formulaic and unoriginal ideas 65 out of 10,black_comedy
smart funny wildly inventive highly original dark comedyfantasy about a struggling and socially inept puppeteer cusack who discovers a portal at his new job that literally gives him access to the mind of mainstream actor john malkovich when he and a manipulative coworker decide to exploit the discovery for all its worth it quickly backfires in more ways than one an unusual but fascinating cleverlyconceived story driven by subtle but broadly funny humor and effectively offthewall performances especially malkovich not always on target yet still finds a way to throw out a new effective idea a real treat for those looking for something fresh and unconventional ,black_comedy
the puppeteer is isolated and tired of his own life like many of us and nobody understands him at all magnified in the filing secretarys constant  and absurd bewilderment at what he is saying this is not a comedy or a fantasy it is a drama which gives us insight into something most of us have thought about but found it hard to conceive the thought of what it is like to be somebody else added to this is the puppeteers skill in learning how to control the character malkovich actually becoming himself again but in a different body all he wants is the name of a star to be able to continue his passion and means of escape so the means of escape is not being somebody else its having circumstances to pursue your dreamswe are all hampered in our dreams by achievable things such as money or gaining recognition but we are easily discouraged so the film is not about being someone else it is about realizing your potential and achieving recognitionmalkovich comes across as dull and everyday we see him through the portal doing everyday things such as showering reading the paper datingnothing special it is only when the puppeteer is in control that we see malkovich earning recognitionsuch as the tv report and the standing ovation to malkovich acting is just a job he is nothing like the mysterious sinister witty character we often see him playingwhen he was asked why he liked acting he gave a very bland uninspiring replythe world is full of souls who believe they have no satisfaction in life or creative outlet unlike the puppeteer for example those lining up to be somebody else for 15 minutes were looking for brief escape from themselves of course we would all like that from time to time so another theme may be the human condition of being trapped in our own heads but no magical escape for us but why would we want to be someone else even movie stars are basically like us they simply have work that makes them well knownso the main characters aim is to use this notoriety to his own ends his own initially it was a basic animal instinct to have sex with a woman he desired but he soon realized what this malkovich face could do for him so i think the writer is advising us to forget about envying other people it is not only impossible to be them but even if you were them you would not find fulfillment be happy with what god gave you and use what you have to the best of your advantage the old people regenerating were a symbol of the pathos of wishing to live forever seize the day  fame is shallow the real malkovich was brave enough to demonstrate this fact he is a good actor but we are just as good at what we do well like our friend the puppeteer,black_comedy
weird  strange  thoughtprovoking  these adjectives can be used to accurately describe what you may feel after watching this very original satirefantasy written by charlie kaufman and directed by spike jonze craig schwartz john cusack is a struggling puppeteer who gets a job as a filing clerk on the 7 12  floor of an office building  one day after dropping a folder behind a filing cabinet craig discovers a small door which leads him into the actual mind of actor john malkovich  after experiencing this unbelievable sensation he is then dumped in a ditch near the new jersey turnpike  craig then relates his experience to his bisexual petloving wife lotte played by an unrecognizable cameron diaz who after going through the portal herself is convinced that she really wants to be john malkovich  malkovich himself seems to be having a good time poking fun at his own image giving light to his own hangups and eccentricities however the films most colorful character is the shrewd shrewish and coldhearted office worker maxine lund played to perfection by catherine keener who deservedly won an academy award nomination who finds herself becoming the object of both craig and lottes sexual obsessions  for a 200 fee craig and maxine begin offering everyday people their own chance to be john malkovich leading to a dramatic and less than hilarious conclusion this is an imaginative and sensational expose in the vein of network and bamboozled about the effects of trading in integrity for dollars nominated for 3 oscars is a movie experience like no other,black_comedy
minor spoilers aheadwas one of the best movies released during the past few years it was surprising that a production of this sort actually made it to the big screen hollywood was actually capable of producing a great artistic film without considering the financial outcomesthis film was not publicized as expected since the producers knew from the outset that this film was not going to be a great financial success the motivation to create this film was to show that there were still some creative minds in hollywood and that they were not afraid to challenge the old stereotype of the empty hollywood classic the style used in this film ties it to its surrealist origins through comedy addresses many issues the first issue dealt with in this film relates to the misfortune of the puppeteer who is trying to show his art and its rejected by a cruel society the rejection of what in the eyes of cusack is real art is revisited throughout the film final redemption is brought when cusack uses malkovichs body to reach his dream to be a worldrenown puppeteer this first issue addressed by the film brings to mind some of the works of early french surrealists such as rene clair jean renoir and jean virgo the second issue raised in this film relates to sexual desires in a more dalibunuel style this film deals with all the sub conscious sexual desires experienced by the characters the characters in get involved in a love triangle cusack and diaz are in love with keener meanwhile keener is not sure whom she loves the last issue dealt with in this film is the desire for common people to be someone else to be someone that is really important to society as a whole to be a celebrity was one of the best recent works out of hollywood this film is a demonstration of the ability of hollywood to create a good and profound film as orson welles did it in the 1940s spike jonze created a film that showed the film industry that innovative good films are the pure expression of the seventh art,black_comedy
ill give the movie credit for being original  and for the most part i could not predict what was coming nextnevertheless i found watching the film to be a painful experience  for one thing most of the characters are selfish and amoral so i didnt much care what happened to them  and i thought that too much time was spent on the love triangle and not enough on the other ideas that were briefly touched uponthe humor in the movie was clever but this is not a comedy in the usual sense  i never laughed out loudi got closer to being sick to my stomach,black_comedy
im not sure that is a bad movie  it may even be a brilliant movie for all i can tell  what i am sure about is that is absolute torture to watch in a way very few movies are the ordinary bad movie feels like being hit over the head and robbed  the robbers motivation is easily understood  this movie is like being hit over the head and then left to bleed in the street  as you lie there you wonder why did he do that  what did i ever do to him and you dont know the answer but you know for damn sure that your head hurtshere there be spoilers  if the description above makes the movie sound too good to miss dont keep readingis mostly about an unsuccessful puppeteer craig schwartz who discovers a magical secret passage which allows him to see out of the eyes of actor john malkovich  schwartz eventually learns to use this passage to actually take control of malkovichs entire body reducing him to a human puppet  schwartz uses this ability to betray his wife and score with his fellow office worker maxine who has not the slightest interest in him or his art but who is instantly aroused by money and the ability to manipulate peoplewhere to begin  craig schwartz and maxine are among the most appalling human beings i have ever seen  i cant begin to imagine what schwartz finds even attractive in maxine never mind lovable  his wife lotte is stupid yes but at first she actually cares for him which maxine never does  in fact lotte is the only reason craig isnt sleeping on a park bench  whats more lotte is physically beautiful while maxine is every bit as reptilian in her outward appearance as in her inward personality  yet betraying lotte isnt the most abominable thing craig does  indeed it isnt even the most abominable thing he does to herthe act the chief characters engage in is a metaphorical act of rape that is to say the invasion of another persons body without their consent  at first its equivalent to the kind of rape committed on a sleeping person without their knowledge later it becomes equivalent to the more brutal kind  the visualization of the means used to invade malkovichs body  a dark wet tunnel filled with mud  lends a disgusting literalness to the metaphor  as you may have guessed this is not funnybut this is not all that makes torture  the film itself is almost unbelievably ugly  not for every second ill admit cameron diaz is pretty and so are the puppets  but they only make the rest of the movie look uglier in comparison  everything looks dark dingy and seedy  color seems to have been drained out of the film  i doubt that catherine keener is anywhere near as ugly in real life as the movie makes her look and i know for sure that john cusack isnt  looks the way the world does when you wake up with a hangovergiven the repulsive characters the sordid subject matter the hideous images and the nearly complete absence of humor or even fun i cant believe that director spike jonze was actually aiming for comedy  nobody could possibly miss the target that widely by accident  some serious point about rape and evil was surely intended  but what  i did pick up on the point that even though he is a disgraceful human being craig is a genuinely talented artist whose abilities are unjustly overlooked having become john malkovich his art has not changed in the least but suddenly the public claims to adore it  is that unfairness the message of the movie if so couldnt it have been conveyed without tormenting metheres not much satisfaction in the ending either  craig does meet a horrible fate which he deserves but maxine and the other villains of the story proceed to live happily ever after while malkovich the only completely innocent party in the whole affair meets the most dreadful end of all  im hoping the ending was meant to be unsatisfying the other possibility that we are meant to feel glad for the triumph of evil is simply too bizarre to contemplatemaybe some person smarter than i figured out the message this movie was intended to convey  if you are that person please email me with the secret because no way am i going to subject myself to againrating 12 out of recommendation if you enjoy solving chess problems while having your hair pulled out this is the movie for you,black_comedy
i desperately wanted to like this movie but i hate it this is a movie that tries too hard to be clever and takes a long time to go anywhere there are some great moments especially as cusaks character settles into his bizarre employment in the sevenandahalfth floor offices but these are rare oases in a lifeless desert of selfindulgent tedium like terry gilliams brazil this movie needs a good 45 minutes cutting from the middlei actually recommend that you rent this movie and sit through every interminable minute of pretentious posturing that it has to offer then go find someone who claims it is a good movie and tell them exactly what you think of it just remember to rent another movie at the same time to avoid a wasted journey to the video storein short  a dull and irritating movie that slowly but surely disappears up its own backside,black_comedy
good fantasy comedy movie with good story and scriptgood as long as one likes the genrea cult classicit could have been a mainstream classic if the cinematography and screenplay was done betterthe lighting and colors here were badvery good cast and acting thoughthis movie is nothing brilliant reallyits just that its differentfor some reason movie producers are afraid to produce these types of unmainstream presentationsgovernmentchurch pressures on holywoodpressure from the mainstream itselfa combination of both and morewhat everi am certain there is a reason for the supression of alterative style movie makingthis is the reason why when a fairly well done alternative style movie comes out like this onewe get over rated praises from alternative starved people and we also get the hellfire rage of the alternative hatersonly for alternative style comedy script movie loversand big fans of the lead actorscharlie sheen included hehehe,black_comedy
i was expecting a great movie with lots of twists and turns  instead i got a below average flick with little plot  yes it is quirky and weird but there have been better films made that are weird and hard to understand such as fight club a clockwork orange and memento  i would not say that it is a waste of time but you definitely have to be in a mood to sit down for two hours and not be mad afterwards for watching the flick,black_comedy
is the most original movie since brazil it shares the same insane sense of humor and presents us with a world which is very similar to the one created in brazil great performances by john cusack john malkovich and cameron diaz but cant be fully appreciated because the material that they work with is the show stealer this is a movie that could have gone over the 200 minute mark and probably still would have been interesting its dark ending is a bit scary and you cant help but feel a bit of sympathy for poor malkovich who gets but a few fleeting seconds of freedom before becoming a prisoner to the greedy old bastard and his collegues it is impossible to dislike this film 95 out of 10,black_comedy
freud meets kafka meets alice in wonderland in the twilight zone with a touch of cocoon there is symbolismall over the place in this movie  puppets performances mirrors etc in an odd way the film delves the nature of the self in this collision of reality and surreality the story gives new meaning to the ideas of rebirth reincarnation and multiple personalities the film is one of the most original clever and funny films i have seen in a long time see it only if you have an imagination and want to think and laugh at the same time,black_comedy
i really wanted to like this movie after reading such wonderful reviews from professional reviewers i covet dearly clever yes creative yes but a little bit of this and a little bit of that is what i think i saw the wonderful film cocoon 2001 alice in wonderland all seemed to come together somewhere along with john malkovich where is all this supposed orginality coming from as i watched the film i kept being reminded of other films id seen it seems a little like the emporers new clothes due to its being a different kind of picture everyone has to say or think its different so its wonderful also  too bad the genuinely creative puppeteer had to end up as the heavydespite my disappointment i must give credit to the actors they all did a super job,black_comedy
okay youre adam spiegel and youve directed lots of beastie boys videos and you want to go for something bigger  so you borrow a name from a 1930s novelty music star you watch a lot of terry gilliam movies steal a bit from each one throw together a lot of acting talent and come up with a meanspirited piece of garbage that in this late90s anythingoffbeatmustbebrilliant critical zeitgeist gets rave reviewsoh yeah you also get oncebrilliant popsellout rem musician michael stipe to produce  voila box office,black_comedy
i had seen this one about a couple years back  my recollection of it was that it was a fun witty pretty original comedy but not especially deep moving or inventive  i do have to think that if this is what passes for deep and challenging or even brilliant audiences may really be that dumbed down  if youre interested in the philosophical questions this raised and i say this as a student of philosophy then go delve into the relevant philosophical texts and youll find out how superficial a treatment of the subject this is  the most poignant philosophical question involved is whether one person could be another  does john malkovich really exist any more as the person he was once a craig schwartz takes over  the answer is craig schwartz was being craig schwartz using what was previously john malkovichs body john ms identity is effectively annihilated  and then    what  it does raise some serious questions but the movie didnt point toward any answer because it would have ruined the comic effect of it all  its not intended to make sense obviously but the effect of this in this movie anyway isnt intellectual but comic  that is because it doesnt really bring any intellectual tools to answer or even really address any of these hard questions  see it as a zany absurd lightweird comedy not as some intellectually engaging masterpiece  it just doesnt deserve to be taken that seriously and the films authors seem to agreethat was my original opinion of the movie and my second viewing of it in the last couple days left my opinion virtually unchangedthis sites database tells me that i had registered a vote of 610 for this movie  for me i try grading on a real curve so a 610 is aboveaverage my second viewing of it led me to think either a 6 or a 7 out of 10 and seeing as my previous rating is a 6 my heart isnt in raising it to a 7 65 out of 10 if halfpoints applyone of the more overrated movies on the site but it seems to have been slowly sliding downward and rightfully so  like a number of other overrated flicks from 1999 i might add  matrix sixth sense magnolia also come to mind  this is not lasting cinema,black_comedy
i have watched and it was a very confusing experience for the first time i saw a movie and couldnt figure out at any point what would happen next many times i tried to think  like a writer  how would i solve this next problem but the writers of bjm had came up with very surprising ideasmovie concluded several puppet show scenes which described dreams of the characters in the film and i guess also our deepest ones too there was something very scary when the puppetmaster made his puppet to watch submissively upwards to its master is this how we live too are we also just puppets okay i have to say that if you are not so interested in philosophical thinking you can still watch the movie because it really is funnyi was also very surprised that i found cameron diaz from the cast because i really didnt notice her appearance and her character actually was one of the main characters i guess it was quite hard to recognize her in thick sweater and dark wig  she looks very much nothing like she is used to be seen and she really is a good actor john cusack was also great and i just had to admire john malkovich  he played so well himself,black_comedy
theres not really too much to say about this movieother than its totally weird strange oddball bizarreyou get the pictureive seen worse moviesbut i cant think of too many that have been stranger,black_comedy
finally a comedy film with a brain  some people want something to stimulate their eyes and minds too  spike j does just that in his directorial film debut  bravo to mr  charlie kaufman the writeran ingenious view on delving into each others skins and minds and ultimately delving into our own  metaphysical but not heavy handed  this film is also quite inspired by spikes experience in music video direction hes done many videos for amazing artists bjork weezer fatboy slim and his craftmenship shows through in the way he chose to portray this quirky film  the actors are amazing that includes john m himself  comedy is getting smarter,black_comedy
i read a review of on the imdb wherein the person posting the comment called it unrealistic  what this person has failed to realized is that thats the point  this film is not about everyday people nor was it made to appeal to an everyday sense of logic  this film was made with an extreme amount of imagination  spike jonze has made an extremely inventive and brilliant filmone of the other high points of this film is the cast which features cameron diaz catherine keener john malkovich himself orson bean and john cusack one of the very best actors of the past two decades see my review for high fidelity  these actors put forth spectacular performances of brilliant characters driven in part by jonzes wonderful dialogueall in all this is a great film  one of the best of the past decade  the fact that it did not recieve an academy award nomination for best picture is absurd  1010,black_comedy
is a film with a wonderfully creative refreshingly original concept but burdened with onedimensional characters and a very flimsy plot  you know what though  it doesnt matter  the concept is so good that its enough by itself  the only really serious criticism i have of the film is that on repeated viewings the minor weaknesses reveal themselves more fully but this seems like such a small petty complaint to level at such a fresh inventive film so is it just a gimmick movie  well yeah it really is  but the gimmick is executed with some real flair  what saves this from being just some minor art house curiosity is primarily the work of two people john malkovich whose performance in this film has been criminally underappreciated and charlie kaufman who wrote the script what allows to succeed as it does is the continuity of the characters even as they go about inhabiting various bodies  thus even though john cusack disappears for a large stretch of the film his character craig schwartz is in it from beginning to end  this is a very difficult feat and the script deserves a lot of credit  but malkovich in particular deserves the credit for undertaking the performance of three very distinct characters in this film  now giving a single performer multiple roles is not a such a big deal  but in this film malkovich had to take over characters from other actors and continue them  when schwartz finally takes over malkovich thats the last we see of cusack for a considerable time  but schwartz is still there  same again when dr lester or if you prefer captain mertin takes over  continuity is kept with the previous actors and their respective performances  this is so crucial to make this film work and the both scriptwriter and the actor deserve credit both for appreciating the importance and actually making it work so sit back and enjoy this truly inventive clever and original film just dont think about it too hard  dont worry about the mechanics of lester taking people with him  dont worry about the utter arbitrariness of craigs infatuation with maxine  dont worry about the even more arbitrary pairing of lotte and maxine  dont worry about how maxine could possibly know whether the child was lottes or craigs  dont worry about the odd coincidence of emily the new vessel being the daughter of malkovich the old vessel and dont worry about how lester knew this or knew anything else about the portal or where the portal was before the mertin flemmer building was built if you want to be a stick in the mud these are legitimate questions  but it just spoils the fun  and in a film as fun as this thats a truly terrible thing to do,black_comedy
its precisely the oddness of this flick that makes it interesting and unique  each plot twist and visual device makes you sit up and pay attention  watching this movie was a great way to do what i like to do best when i go to a movie  escape  the only reason i didnt vote it higher is because its not a movie ill pick up again and again seeing it for one good viewing is the perfect way to do it  this is also not a movie to select if youre tired or not willing to allow yourself to be immersed in an alternative reality  but do yourself a favor and find the time for this movie at some point when youre ready for something truly different,black_comedy
i had heard a lot of good things about this movie and was looking forward to seeing it but it was a huge disappointmentfirst of all its supposed to be a comedy but i dont think ive laughed once maybe i smiled a couple of times in this movie its supposed to be funny that an office building has a sevenandahalfed floor that an apartment is filled with animals hello ace ventura anyone and that nobody seems to know what parts john malkovich playedas for the acting john cusack is terrible john malkovich hardly gets a chance to act and for some obscure reason cameron diaz is made almost unrecognizable with a very ugly hairdress and a very boring partthe story is original yes but its also completely sick and confusing involving a woman having a lesbian relationship with another woman who is inside john malkovichs head john cusack locking up his girlfriend a sick guy that survives by getting inside other peoples heads etcmaybe this review is a little confusing but so was the movie and i really dont know what else to say about it except for the fact that its very bad,black_comedy
allows spike jonze to demonstrate hisconsiderable cinematic powers outside the realm of music videosand commercials  working with a superb script and a wonderfullyeclectic cast jonze has made a film that is funny inventiveand completely unique  a secret tunnel allows john cusackaccess to john malkovichs head and from there the film takesoff  in order to fully appreciate this film you have to seeit  a truly original film that can never be copied,black_comedy
i can define this film with just two words incredibly amazing if you like cinema its essential to see this movie what are u waiting 4 one of the questions that i made myself when the film ended was is she really cameron diaz go and guess yourself,black_comedy
i saw this movie and was immediately taken with the whole idea of the film i love seeing thru the eyes of john malkovich when the director permits is this what actors really do at home i bought this movie to play at home when i want to escape the boredom of everyday its so much fun to watch i love john cusack it took me a few minutes at first to get used to him all raggedy looking i think hes great cameron diaz was great in this film but was that really her well at least john malkovich looked like john malkovichuntil he went through his own portal that was something to see if you like interesting films and you arent afraid to be amused see this,black_comedy
previous to this film i watched 8mm  that film made me want to take a shower with lye soap and a brillo pad but it didnt disturb me half as much as this sick little fantasy  at first i was fascinated by the puppetry aspect  i laughed over the conceit of a seventh and a half floor the lady who first shows cusack how to get out at that floor should get an honorary oscar for her bit part mary kaye place was a treat as the snotty incomprehensible secretary even that first trip through malkovichs brain was a hoot  thenit stopped being a brilliant discussion of manipulation who after all is the real puppet herethe wooden puppets malkovichor cusacks loser puppeteer himself and turned into something so revolting i was glad i had rented it from my libraryhow many times have we had to sit through the plot device of the old lecher boss  how many times have you watched a story in which our hero such as he is pursues the ice queen only to learn shes in love with his wife or some other woman in the storyand continues blindly to pursue her after he learns the truth  after a while the satire wore thin and really what did it all amount to in the endi did want to like it because of the way it handles manipulation and for the really nasty twist in the last few seconds poor little emilyultimately though i want to get the taste of this movie out of my mouth  ugh,black_comedy
why this movie is so overrated eludes me if its just a pleasant light romantic comedy thats okay nothing else seemed interesting and no serious thoughts could be generated by having seen it and i still dont understand why john malkovich if you want a famous person try high profile guys if you want an anonymous person try an anonymous person anyway this is the film weve got and this is what we are supposed to judge its not bad but dont expect something big,black_comedy
this movie is a spectacular portrayal of charlie kaufmans imaginative subject about what it would be like to be in someone elses head and eventually someone elses body  ultimately the movie asks us who we are and tries to urge us to enjoy who we are regardless of our outer appearance whether it be gender or simple shame of ones appearance the movie gives us examples of people who arent happy with their physical bodes ironically the two people are married and shows us that no matter who we try to be ultimately we must be ourselves and that this truth is inescapable  in a way the movie shows us that selfreliance is paramount  the film shows an especially good contrast between a man who allows his passions to control his actions and another who uses reason to decide the fate of his life and in actuality the length of his life  this theme is almost platonic because the movie shows us which course of action is more moral and luckily although perhaps not realistically in this movie morality wins out,black_comedy
it is so easy to go off the deep end on this type of project never to see your audience again  this gifted crew make certain that the audience goes for the ride by never taking the more extreme avenue available to them just the streets that will get everyone to the glorious logical and inexplicable endi had no expectations when i began watching this movie but was enthralled in moments by the wackiness within the written parts played by cusack and diaz once i was hooked i never moved until the end of the closing creditsdamn good movie,black_comedy
this film although original was a very poor attempt by spike jonze  the script even though a good idea was very badly written the idea of being in someone elses body could have been explored and this idea expanded upon alot more  what could have a brilliant original film came across as weird and disturbing and just plain stupid  the acting wasnt the best overall this film was original yet boring and just plain stupid 310,black_comedy
this movie has an interesting premise and gets off to a good start unfortunately the premise doesnt hold for longer than 20 minutes and then the movie becomes interminable it eventually turns into everyone in the audience desperately wondering how much longer it will last,black_comedy
i made my mom watch this movie and she hates offbeat movies and the only thing i told her was that shes probably never seen anything like it i wasnt lyingthere is absolutely nothing like this anywherei dare not give anything away except that this movie has without a seconds doubt the most sublimely hilarious sequence ive ever seen  watch for the part that begins with craig asking what happens when a man enters his own subconciouswoah,black_comedy
i did not like this movie and found it to be a pretentious lot of nonsense initially the story is interesting in a hobbitty as in the lord of the rings kind of way but soon turns into a drawn out lot of nonsense with a very predictable endinghowever there are some redeeming properties for one john cusack and cameron diaz are probably in the most atypical role of their lives i did not even recognize diaz at first the puppets and puppeteers in this movie are very good and john malkovich in his ballet seen is firstrate assuming he did not have a stunt doublei suggest you give this movie a skip unless youre into the arty kind,black_comedy
is the most inventive original movie of the year if not the decade through the entire movie just as you think you have it figured out or are feeling comfortable with the plot the filmmaker throws you another wellplaced curve the movies originality never lets up from start to finish besides the writing and directing the acting is also top notch certainly deserving more oscars than it got  if you havent seen do so,black_comedy
this is a bizarre film with a bizarre story however it is a very creative story  craig schwartz john cusack gets a job at a company on the 7 12 floor of a office building while organizing some files craig finds a door behind a filing cabnet  inside the door is a portal into another world the world of another person  craig can experience thoughts feelings and see the actions of this other person  the only thing it that this other person is famous actor john malkovich however craig can only experince this for only 15 minutes then he winds up on the side of the road at the new jersey turnpike  craig and his sexy coworker maxine catherine keener see this door as a money profit business  yet craig has also fallen in love with maxine eventhough hes already married to an animal loving pet store owner lotte cameron diaz  from there on is a wild and twisted story that keeps going up hill until the very end i have never seen a film quite like this one  this seems like something that former monty python member terry gilliam would have thought of  its very creative and at the same time twisted strange and very very funny  i thought the idea of a building being on the 7 12 floor was creative but theres a lot more creative images and settings than just that scene  and the dialogue is also very witty  with such lineslike nobodys looking for a puppeteer in todays wintry economic climate is the most wittiest lines that i have heard actors give since the marx brothers the acting is also very well done  john cusack is excellent as usual as the man who torn between two women seeing the world through two people cameron diaz took a big risk playing a nonglamorous role and she still manages to pull through  catherine keener is also great as the seductive coworker who has plans of her own  and of course john malkovich himself is also very enjoyable as well himself but malkovich is such a great sport that he even allows the story to make fun of himself director spike jonze vig from three kings is going to be a popular director because of this film  he directs the film along the same simialr lines as a terry gilliam film dark bizarre and funny  and writer charlie kaufman shows a promising career with this being his first major film  i would be very upset if this film doesnt get a oscar for best original screenplay it deserves it   out of five,black_comedy
i do not understand what all the fuss is about and why this movie received such a high rating by many viewers the only explanation i can think of is its novelty value because imho the only good thing about this movie is the idea of temporarily seeing the world through someone elses eyes unfortunately the execution of the idea is terrible that a puppeteer should ultimately control john malkovich is cute but hardly very intellectually challenging the builtup to the climax does not deserve being described as such one never really feels anything for the main characters and the acting is mediocre at best what a pity,black_comedy
but certainly not great for a film that is as much arthouse as it is mainstream it makes no point at all whatsoever and it comes nowhere near taking advantage of its wonderful premise all we get is a shaggy john cusack and a bushy cameron diaz going head to head over catherine keener through john malkovich it does have the occasional weird charm but i feel like it could have been so much more only a few scenes raised a smile in me dont get me wrong ive never seen a movie that had so much originality to it but i have also never seen a movie that did so little with its ingenious idea it becomes quite boring and saggy in places whenever this happened i just wanted it to go to another scene where they go inside john malkovichalsothe ending makes no sense whatsoever and the writer doesnt even give an explanation for the portal or how it is possible this may have worked for groundhog day but just seems lazy here it takes advantage of the audience and is very superficial as you may have guessed the ending annoyed me very much   i do recommend you see this movie but dont let the hype and blindfaith of others cloud your opinion,black_comedy
id heard a lot about this movie this is the most overrated movie of the last 10 years vile boring characters unbearable distance intellectual pretense yes there are funny sequences yes occasionally an interesting idea surfaces only to be sabotaged by the screenplays heavyhandedness and political correctness the acting is good the direction stylish but full of gimmicks the writing is absolute trash 5 out of 10 nowhere near what i expected,black_comedy
imho this is one of the most overrated films of 99  broken down into constituent elements its got a lot going for it  a certainly original story and a wellcrafted telling of it interesting characters wellplayed by all and principals we all like to like the two central johns especially for mebut what i was quickly left with in this film is so what  when you put together all these elements at the end of the experience are we left with anything that really means anything to anybody  not for me  frankly im tired of all the nihilism that comes out of hollywood and tries to pass for art and entertainment  american beauty and pulp fiction come readily to mind  go ahead and blast away  we fool ourselves into thinking that these kinds of films show a maturing of the audience when in fact its only the dumbing down of the audience and vastly lowered expectations that allow these things to be made in the first place  just because a movie never could have been brought to an audience only a few years back because the audience wouldnt have stood for it doesnt mean those audiences of the past were lacking sophistication  they just had a finer appreciation for the real meaning of drivel  you know its ok to say somethings crap when it is and even better to be able to say so when just about everyone else says otherwisethe best i can say is that fortunately john malkovich will go right on playing compelling characters in movies hereon out and ill be able finally to forget this onei didnt like this movie very much,black_comedy
talk about a movie that made me wish i hadnt seen it i had high hopes for bjm after reading reviews and hearing the positive remarks of those who had seen it but i was really bored with this film the idea is great but the after awhile it gets boring and repetitive it came off more like a music video than a movie and just didnt connect with mesorry but i give this film a 410,black_comedy
ive been anxious to see this movie since watching the preview and i must say i was not disappointedin fact it has tied with american beauty as my favorite film of the year  there are so many layers to this movie like ab that ill have to see it again  john malkovichs participation in the movie is the key to why its so successful  ive always viewed him as a slightly overrated actor  kind of selfimportant  its refreshing that he must see this as well  the other actors are just as charismatic  they must have known that no one has ever done a movie like this before at least that ive seen in my years although the film works on many different levels the moral is very simplebe happy with who you are  one movie that i couldve watched all over again after it was over,black_comedy
well tonight i finally watched this muchtalkedabout film that i have been dying to see and i am disappointed to sayi was slightly disappointed i love john malkovich in anything and catherine keener is one of my favorite character actresses but the first hour of the movie was sooo ploddingly slow i was itching to turn it off im glad i didnt because it got much better in the last hour i realize a lot of the posts here say the opposite that the first hour was better but i beg to differ to each his own i guess i myself enjoyed the injokes with charlie sheen sean penn etc john malkovich himself was great as usual and though john cusack cameron diaz and catherine keener were good too i still dont see the need for catherines oscar nomination it was an excellent idea and some of the bits were greatthe trip cameron and catherine took through malkovichs subconscious you have to wonder if those were real experiences of his youth was suberb and the flashback that elijah the chimp had to the jungle and his parents being tied up was very good and touching as wellthe end could have been tied up a little bit better ie where was the portal to enter emilys head all in all it was entertaining but there could have been a little more to hold my attention in the first half it was thoughtprovoking but they could have done more with the concept instead of focusing on that bizarre love triangle,black_comedy
ill watch damn near anything  bought this one on dvd based on the title and description on the box  weird  thought provoking  could have done without the same gender proxy pregnancy  would have prefered something more cerebral like the movie started out to be with cusack asking questions like where is the board i had with me  stuck in his head,black_comedy
this is the most original film i have seen in years i have always been a fan of malkovich and cusack  the movie had enough twists and turns to keep it interesting  though a little hard to follow at times its premise being able to enter someone elses brain is intriguing  jonz did a great job of making a very unusual film,black_comedy
certainly ranks among the most brilliantly conceived and executed films of the past several years  overflowing with imagination and creativity it manages to breathe new life into that trickiest of cinematic genres  the surrealist satire  like all films that dare to take risks sometimes stumbles in the paths it chooses to take but at least its course is always an innovative and fascinating onejohn cusack stars as craig schwartz a softspoken nebbish leading a life less of quiet desperation than of overwhelming blandness  unable to support himself as a puppeteer he finally succumbs to his wifes pressure to seek out a job landing a position as file clerk in a bizarre company located on the 7  th floor of a manhattan office building  one of the triumphs of the film is that it portrays the surreal in such an understated and quiet way this floor has ceilings so low that the people who work on it must continually crouch as they move about their business yet they all accept that fact with an uncomplaining and unquestioning good humor  even when schwartz discovers a strange portal hidden behind some cabinets leading directly into john malkovichs brain all those to whom craig reveals his secret take very little convincing both to believe him and to experiment with it themselves  thus by creating a world that already appears slightly askew in its reality  craigs wife in addition runs a pet shop and therefore fills their house with a menagerie of exotic animals the film makes it possible for us to go along with the characters otherwise inexplicably blas reactionswriter charlie kaufman and director spike jonze hit upon a number of fascinating themes in the course of their bizarre musings  craig for instance learns that there exists a certain safety in the tediousness of everyday life for the moment he allows the extraordinary to enter his ordered world he unleashes passions  that have been long dormant both in himself and his wife  which he finds himself unable to control  his wife in particular whom he has mistakenly pigeonholed as a woman concerned only with the humdrum domesticities associated with married life provides him with a rude awakening as she begins to surpass him in her burgeoning obsession with experiencing the excitements of sexual liberation  craig also discovers the terrifying truth about himself that beneath the faade of a meek mildmannered artist there lurks the soul of a repressed despot as he comes more and more to relish the ability to move into malkovichs mind and control his thoughts and actions  much as with his beloved puppets but now on a much more grand much more malevolent scale  the film generates much of its comic tension through the complex sexual interplay that develops among craig his wife lotte and his alluring but enigmatic coworker maxine in whom both husband and wife develop a more than passing sexual interest  with tinges of no exit the three characters find themselves caught in a frustrating world of overlapping and therefore clashing sexual desires and passionsthe film demonstrates a real stroke of genius in its casting  john cusack with his look of understated bewilderment perfectly conveys the soul of a man too long accustomed to expecting little in the way of surprise out of life  catherine keener brilliantly captures the detached cynicism and taunting coolness that makes her such an enthralling sexual temptation to both craig and lotte  and whose audacious decision was it to cast cameron diaz as the neardowdy second fiddle to kenner to make her the nonsex object in the film  as for mr malkovich himself he seems to be having the selfdeprecating time of his life as he allows himself and even his lack of general public name recognition to become targets for gentle ribbingis not a perfect movie  it occasionally sags in places and suffers from some repetition and like many utterly original and audacious works it sometimes alienates its audience through its quality of oftencold calculation  at moments in which the iconoclasm seems to become an end in itself one may be tempted to see the film in emperorsnewclothes terms wondering if what one is seeing is really as brilliant as it appears or just an intellectual scam being played on a selfcongratulatory elite audience  for the most part however is fertile enough in its invention and varied enough in its imaginativeness to rate as a film well worth seeing and cherishing  there should definitely be more like it,black_comedy
i had no idea what this film was about when i rented it  after seeing it im still not sure  it is definitely the strangest film i have ever seen possibly the most original as well  the first hour or so was absolutely hilarious  then the film for me became darker and stranger  the performances were all marvelous and interesting  the concept is thoughtprovoking  not an easy film to stop thinking about,black_comedy
this movie would have had the calibre to become one of the great ones and up to about three quarters of the film it was a delight the first movie out of hollywood in a long time that was not a remake sequel or other unoriginal production but then  what if anything did overcome the filmmakers to have such a finish what a shameif i could go back in time i would leave the theatre after about one hour and think of that as a good movie unfortunately all that i can say about it now is unintellectual hollywood kitsch,black_comedy
good first attempt spike jonze at doing a sanitized terry gilliam movie that suffers from a bad hollywood endingthis film had so much potential in starting with a bizarre premise  through the film it later studies the nature of artistic medium the actor  director relationship the depth of the human psyche and personal observation in relationships  however by the end we are treated to a lame love story a stupid scifi premise and a hollywood inside jokegreat performances by john cusak cameron diaz orson bean john malkovich and mary kay place why diaz was overlooked for the average catherine keener is beyond me because diaz really goes all out in this roll it is too bad that there is 10 minutes of ending that could have been left on the cutting room floor  otherwise this could have been a real classic if it had the courage to follow its story rather than pander to hollywood,black_comedy
once i was involved in the story i was so absorbed by the story and the characters i forgot where i waswhere i was was alice tully hall at lincoln center tonight at the premiere of this extremely original and funny filmseeing the trailer two weeks ago cracked me up so much i went to and watched it again and again  and this morning to my surprise i read in the ny times review that it would be playing tonight and tomorrowboy am i glad i showed up early and hunted down a spare ticket it was sold out at the new york film festival  cusack malkovich and keener perform wonderfully as do diaz and the supporting castyou probably know what this film is about and if you dont i wont spoil it but whatever youve heard take a chance and see it  it is a winner and i predict a nomination for best original screenplay oscar and possibly some acting awards for keener who turns in a first rate performancea strange inner life takes over the story and it truly challenges the viewer to think about the strangest and even profound questions of reality love existence and life and death  but mostly it was goofy surreal and very cleverwhat a treat it was to see the actors walk the red carpet pose for the cameras and whisper to each other on the way in to the show  and it was a privilege to ask the writer questions in person at the panel afterwards im definitely joining the society and will make sure i see more films this way  it is a great evening outwhile mr malkovich walked down the carpet i got a few laughs from the crowd by yelling malkovich  malkovich  those who have seen the movie will understand,black_comedy
when i saw this movie i amazed at the originality of it i have never seen a movie stranger than this in my life when i walked out of the movie theater i felt really strange i was like whoa that movie was good and it was funny not that many comedy movies are this good i highly recommend you watch this,black_comedy
i had heard comments and the general feeling is that this is supposed to be a comedy  i didnt feel that way at all  its dark and depressing  dont watch this movie if yer in a bad mood  or should i say dont watch it if yer in a good mood since watching it in a bad mood might actually lighten yer dayi liked this movie nontheless but probably not watch it again simply because its too dark for me  dark comedy perhaps  even there swimming with sharks easily takes first prize there  one thing though i sure dont feel sorry for john cusacks character 9 out of 10,black_comedy
its fitting that this movie was done by the same person who directed fatboy slim videos the idea of this movie seems the same as fatboys music to sample a broad swath of pop detritus and use it to create something new such seems to be the postposteverything school of art and is a good but hardly perfect study of that schoolthe first thirty minutes of this movie delivered an hilarious absurdist setup that reminded me of terry gilliam complete with brazillike improbable office space directing a david letterman skitbut unfortunately one slowly realizes the rest of the movie is more like the rocky horror picture show starring the characters from ally mcbeal entering malkovichs brain and observing his extraordinarily boring life seems almost inevitable when put in the context of the incredibly overthetop characters that populate this movie  worse their obsession to become john malcovich becomes a heavyhanded attempt to explore tired existential philosophies with the effect being a bit like watching mtv discuss social issues  there were times when i thought i should be laughing but i worried that maybe by doing so i was actually not getting itdespite my disappointment at the film to leave me feeling satisfied i still recommend it it is very inventive and creative and has some very welldone moments  i especially like the gawdawful orientation video scene complete with bad actors dressed in late 70s attirethis sort of creativity should be encouragednot necessarily rewarded at this stage but encouraged in hopes it will mature  i think its possible to take a bizarre idea and make it into a satisfying fulllength moviebut it will take some practice  is a good first attempt,black_comedy
after half an hour accompanying craig to the 7 12th floor meeting the love of his life maxine their boss lester and his linguistic secretary you shout wow its great its like brazil i like it after discovering the tunnel to malkovichs head it changes although malkovich plays very well it doesnt work together the nonsense of the basic idea and the drama of identity crisis in craig and his wife comedy and tragedy coexist without a link or a hint how to work it up in your brain in the very end your mood changes again you say wow never seen a film with so many philosophic ideas and so many levels of reflection but i had a date at the cinema hadnt i and i planned to watch a good movie and i didnt get it,black_comedy
this is a clever and imaginative story with a lot of droll and peculiar situations that make for an entertaining film  john cusack plays craig schwartz a frustrated puppeteer who cant find work  he takes a job as a file clerk and discovers a portal that leads inside john malkovichs head that allows him to see and experience what malkovich is doing for 15 minutes until it spits him out on the new jersey turnpike  the remainder of the film uses this device to create absurd uses for the portal from selling tickets to malkovich to two women having sex using malkovichs bodyultimately the puppeteer discovers how to take over malkovich and he proceeds to usurp malkovichs life  in one particularly ingenious scene schwartz is manipulating malkovich to be a puppeteer who has a marionette manipulating yet another smaller marionette  its a little like russian matroishka dolls where every time you open one there is another smaller one inside  if you take it one step further it was really maxine who was the master puppeteer manipulating schwartz to manipulate malkovichthis film goes beyond humor of the absurd to humor of the bizarre  at times it gets a bit too far out to be funny like when malkovich goes inside malkovich and sees malkovichs everywhere  but the material is fresh and innovative and most of the skits work well silly as they sometimes arespike jonze is a strange guy with a strange sense of humor which is perfect for this film  if you get the dvd one of the bonus features is an interview with jonze  if you see this interview you will get a fuller understanding of just how strange he can be  he does some very interesting things with the camera lighting and setup that give the film a very distinctive look  this was jonze first feature film  clearly his work in music videos where directors are a lot freer to push the creative envelope helped in the making of this film  i thought he could have done a better job with the malkovich perspective it looked like you were looking backwards through a pair of binoculars but most of the camera work was quite good  i particularly liked the way he split the sound tracks to have malkovichs voice come out of the back speakers while in his perspectivethe acting in this film was terrific  john malkovich who excels in both dramatic and comedic roles did a fabulous job of playing himself poking fun at himself at every turn  poor john cusack  he is such a tall guy and they made him play half his part on a set with 4  foot ceilings  he was very funny as the tortured puppeteer  catherine keener was a scream as the bitchy and evil maxineoverall this film is a rollicking good time  i rated it 810  it is funny throughout but sometimes goes a little too far off the deep end  if you like absurd humor you will love this film,black_comedy
a truly original piece of cinema never before have i seen a movie like this the cast is wonderful and john malkovich has never been funnier the scenes where he goes into his own head are hilarious spike jonze deserves our credit for directing his first feature film and getting an oscar nomination for best director hes following in the footsteps of his famous fatherinlaw the great francis ford coppola great film,black_comedy
i wish i could never expect things from films before i have seen them in fact i wish films would be released in sweden at the same time as in the usa i have come to the conclusion after having seen that no film could ever live up to the high expectations i had when i walked into the cinema today i actually had this feeling of unreality when i sat down at my seat i was like i cant believe im actually going to watch this film the reason for me thinking that is 1 that i have longed to see it for so long and 2 that i live in a small town population 95000 in sweden where it wasnt even certain that would be shown so of course i was hugely disappointed let me tell you right away though that i liked the film the premise is totally bizarre and very fascinating the acting is brilliant especially catherine keener and john malkovich and it was rather entertaining however it is also about twenty minutes too long and i think the original story was taken too far in the end it wasnt very funny anymore only sad since you realize that none of the people in the film are likeable at all with the exception of poor john malkovich who is being used and abused in the worst way  a disappointment but nevertheless a good film,black_comedy
what would have been a reasonable idea for a short film or dare i say it a music video is hopelessly overstretched here spike is a talented guy and has done some very amusing promos for the beasties and fatboy slim but on this evidence is simply not ready to go the distance a major disappointment,black_comedy
to call this film bunuellian is to flatter its political engagement because this is literally the product of a culture that has turned in on itself to speak politely but you can see the point craig is a heterosexual monster with artistic bourgeois trimmings whose hairy slovenliness signifies the retreat into bestiality of his zoohome where he locks his wife in a cage and rapes hisher loved one by pretending to be someone else twice over this is dangerous dark stuff and the films punishment of craig  he is forever trapped in the body of a child doomed to watch the happiness of the two women in his life  lets us off the hook in a way bunuel never would and it might seem a bit hard to take a happy ending celebrating a world where men arent necessary from two very successful men but the film is terrific fun civilised in its mindbending misanthropyoptimism even if if i may say so under imdb guidelines it kind of loses it in the last third,black_comedy
this is more like it a film that actually surprises you all the way through with some brilliant writing and superb acting performances from cusack diaz and malkovich himselfjust the whole concept is weird enough to make you take a completely different slant on the film right down to the portal to johns mind being itself on the 7 and a halfth floor of a buildingexcellent script brilliant acting and a fantastically weird idea makes this one of the best films i have seen in a long time,black_comedy
quirky comedy about office workers who discover a secret passage that ends up somewhere inside john malkovitchs head they proceed to get into a hilarious genderidentity love triangle overrated if taken as anything more deep but entertaining a cult hit,black_comedy
although the movie stumbles a little in the 2nd half its originality mark it out as a rare gem so much of what we see is formula and consumer driven keener is superb and cusack reminds us of his gross pointe ability dont be put off by people describing this film as weird its a modern day fairytale and one of the mustsee films for 2000,black_comedy
opens brilliantly an unbelievably beautiful demonstration of puppeteering which introduces us to craig schwartz john cusak a tormented artist far more capable of communicating his passions and angst via his puppets than directly to his wife lotte cameron diaz not too surprising since lotte is a fairly gross and dirty human being who kisses and shares her beverages with her chimpanzee in fact the most unbelievable line in the movie is lotte asking craig to let her take a shower lotte doesnt strike me a person whom would ever want one  perhaps due to this craig becomes immediately smitten when he meets maxine christine keener a slightly slutty fairly attractive gold digger when he answers an ad for a man with fast hands to do filing at dr lesters orson bean  what dr lester does is not all that clear but the business apparently involves handling files for other companies interesting because the offices are tiny and not just because the place has low overhead being the 7 12 floor  anyway while filing craig discovers an opening behind one of the cabinets  entering it he discovers a portal into actor john malcovichs psche  up to this point the movie is a brilliant existentialist comedy the best since brazil  however about two thirds of the way through the film too much information is revealed turning the film into fantasysci fi sorry this movie doesnt have the budget for it  it makes an old outer limits episode look like star wars episode 1 by comparison  it also calls into question everything which has proceeded  fantasysci fi must be grounded in some form of plausibility  companies which keep files either have huge climate controlled storage use disks or at least microfiche dirty or not diaz is still too desirable to make craigs obsession with maxine catherine keener all that convincing diaz is good in the part but her casting throws the film way off  either the producers should have cast ellen degeneres in the part or have cast michelle pfieffer as maxineultimately is a fairly amusing disappointment much better in concept than execution,black_comedy
after seeing this film the first word that came to my mind was weird this is a weird movie but i mean that in a good way for one thing its very original and thats certainly something thats been lacking in hollywood for a long time its about this talented downonhisluck puppeteer john cusackwho accepts a meaningless job for a company that operates on the 7 12 floor you have to see it to believe it trust me and discovers in his office a portal that takes him to the mind of actor john malkovich not to malkovichs house mind you not to his office but into his actual mind yes folks its an existential conundrum of a movie whats it like to be john malkovich you wonder watch and learn gentle viewer watch and learn we see john in the morning making himself some breakfast we see him rehearsing at a local theater we see him hitting on the ladies and we see him commiserating with charlie sheen of all people i didnt even know they ran in the same circles but being in john malkovichs head is only one of the issues at hand  how this all affects the puppeteers girl an unrecognizable cameron diaz and his newfound partner catherine keener and how they interact is even more intriguing this isnt a movie the likes of which youve seen before you see just when you think you have stuff figured out and you can settle down and gnaw on some stale pretzels something else weird happens to make you have to rethink it againthis is certainly not a movie for all tastes just as eraserhead wasnt a movie youd recommend to everyone you know if youre a fan of the offbeat the odd or the downright weird heres your movie enjoy,black_comedy
is the best comedy of 1999 equally as twisted as anything david lynch could come up with but with a lot more laugh out loud humour and a lot less pretentiousnessthe cast is brilliant particularly cusak as a completely hopelesstragic puppeteer john malkovich must be applauded for his outstanding portrayal of himself possibly one of the more challenging parts ive seen anyone perform it was also great to see cameron diaz play a complete frump as opposed to her usual tizzy blond rolei give this film 1010 for the amount of laughs it provided and the uniqueness of it all a brilliant  must see movie,black_comedy
the story could easily have been published in the magazine of fantasy and science fiction or this is less of a compliment but certainly not a criticism asimovs  anyone who liked the movie should certainly look through these publications and others like them  both magazines are still very much alive and its a pity theyre not read more  but for maximum pleasure do try to find some copies of fantasy and science fiction from its glory days of the 1950s and 1960s  please dont do this if you live in australia because im trying to track down old copies myselfindeed the story would probably have reached its ideal type in literary form so its a pity kaufman didnt submit it to the magazines  they wouldnt have paid as much but he could always have made a screenplay out of the idea later  some aspects like the thirteenthandahalfth floor and the puppetry are well suited to cinema but the central conceit would be better served by the written word  how does one show visually that craig is receiving all the sensory information that john malkovich is receiving  i dont thing kaufman and jonze quite solve this problemthere are people out there who think that good plots intelligent dialogue consistency and cleverness are all purely literary virtues of no particular value in the cinema  this is a silly view  any work of art that has a plot can be judged according to the quality of its plot any work of art capable of manifesting intelligence can be judged according to how intelligent it is  speaking of which i do have one quibble as everyone knows theres this tunnel and when one gets to the end of the tunnel one experiences whatever john malkovich is experiencing  what happens when john malkovich himself enters the tunnel  the film offers an answer and its pretty lame  not that i know myself what would happen  i guess its underdetermined  but heres a thought suppose theres a timedelay so that a person in the tunnel experiences whatever malkovich experienced say 001 seconds earlier  then john malkovich entering the tunnel would experience 001 seconds of john malkovich entering the tunnel again and again and maybe each copy of the experience would be more degraded than the lasti cant think of anything wrong with the details of the story  its because of the story that is so good if not the masterpiece everyone seems to think it is  the cinematic prose could do with a bit of a rewrite,black_comedy
this has to be the best film i have ever been fortunate to see in a movie theater i found its unique devices innovative and refreshing blah blah blah its all been said before and i agree with it all but there were two things about this film that stood out for me that i have not yet seen touched upon the first is the films ability to manipulate me exactly they way it wanted to and with out me realizing it at first the biggest form of this being my newfound desire to actually be john malkovich if only for a few minutes there we so many different types of characters and despite all their differences they all wanted to be this somewhat obscure character actor i soon began to honestly want to shell out my 200 to experience what it would be like to experience what none of us can ever do not even with those closest to us get inside someones head and truly see the world from their eyes this ability the film had also worked very well with the character of maxine lets face it folks this girl is not terribly easy on the eyes her face has some witch like qualities to it the long crooked nose the large teeth that mole on her chin she was skinny not slender skinny and boney and no fit for the role of the temptress in any other movie but by the end of this film through shear personality alone she became a slinky velvety sexy vivacious and desirable woman i really really wanted her and i could see why everyone else wanted her too she was almost worth killing for in other words the film made me understand the motivations of the characters like no other the second unique part of the film was malkovich himself and the fact that he played himself this is a rare treat in films that is very hard to make possible its also a very brave thing to do unlike movies like private parts where the main character plays the lead in his autobiography malkovich is not an egomaniacal device to prove something to the world instead we get little snippets of what could be real experiences of the actor often in portions of his life require excruciating vulnerability this goes from such small snippets as childhood photos to scenes like that of young malkovich sitting in a dark basement chanting about what a bad boy he is or being taunted on the school bus you are left wondering if these are real experiences or not either way the actor is defining himself as he is playing himself in less than flattering ways that make the audience look at him very differently i think john malkovich deserves so much of the credit for making this movie extraordinary,black_comedy
has an interesting premise with implications it follows unerringly  it also has an unfortunate core of unpleasantness  a cast of characters almost entirely with negative qualities ranging from pathetic to evil  which hurts quite a bit i think  i dont wonder that these folks would be desperate to shuck off their own personas for fifteen minutes or that their own morality would allow them to exploit malkovich what would have been interesting is the idea of the decent person seduced by such an idea  that might have led to a hitcockian setup in which the hero is often punished for being bored and wishing something anything would happen there are funny jokes and great touches here and there malkovich tries the portal himself to hilarious effect diazs character bumping her head and she moves murderously through a doorway  overall the movie is overrated probably because it succeeds in not being stupid and there are genuine surprises  could become a cult film or be properly revisited and dismissed much as wild at heart was,black_comedy
the script seemed fairly creative and the opening puppet show gave me a lot of hope for a great film  however it slowly went down hill as the story went on  ultimately it didnt have much to say  just tired old jokes worked over and the feeling of being just another hollywood type film by the end i was really bored and quite happy when it came to an end  its not a bad film compared to others out there now  yet it held out hope for something more and didnt carry through  yawn,black_comedy
i read a few reviews from 99 and i totally agree with them this is the art my favorite movie of all times beats goodfellas fight club matrix china town taxi driver etc i can watch it 247 probably but i prefer to do so under alco or herb influence it makes me live in that alternate universe and i love it fricking 1010 for me perfect cinema in my book wonder what creators were on when they made this masterpiece its perfect funny tragic surreal o props for all the actors especially cussack cause that is the one ive seen most of in other great films 1408 identity etc his best performance is here imo cause for that caliber of an actor it mustve been really hard to make this mr juares work but it did seamlessly  and i gotta give props for mr director of martinflemer with his sick sexual fantasies his performance was epic  its one in a century movie truly unique and totally engaging at the same time i want to live in this surreal world  1010 again just blows my mind this film o,black_comedy
i just reviewed it because movie cant get worse than this to warn movie fanatics not to get fooled by its high ratingits an absolute piece of crap nauseating stinking claustrophobicughhwords in the entire human vocabulary are not enough to state how highly nonsensical movie this isplease dont get disillusioned by its high rating if you watch 1 or 2 movies like this you will definitely give up watching movies altogetherthis was one of the most boring and pointless movies i have ever seen in my life,black_comedy
the thing that caught my attention about this film was not just its weird name but that is seemed to be about some minor but reasonably good hollywood actor john malkovich is one of those actors that we have heard of but we are not really all that familiar with the films that he has been in at least at the time of this movie because i am sure we have all heard of red and conair as such he is a bit more malleable than maybe a megastar like mel gibsonthis movie is about the nature of ourselves the idea of the soul and the voyeuristic concept of being allowed inside somebody else in this case it is very similar to kathryn bigalows strange days but somewhat more bizarre and more fantastic than that moviethe movie is focused around a group of people a puppeteer john cusack who i did not recognise his wife cameron diaz who once again i did not recognise and some strange woman name maxine who loves john malkovich only when the puppeteers wife is inside him the puppeteer gets a job at a filing office on the 7 floor which is half the height of normal floors of a building one day while he is working he finds a door that leads to a tunnel he crawls down the tunnel and discovers that it is a portal inside the head of john malkovich where he remains for 15 minutes and then is spat out onto the side of the new jersey turnpikeas such this film deals with the concept of the soul and the human body little more than a puppet this is why the main character is a puppeteer because he comes to quickly control malkovich as a puppeteer we also learn that the portal is for a man dr lester who is actually a really old irish sailor who uses the portal to go into another body when that body reaches a certain age he has also learned how to take multiple people with him in the end it seems that it is heading towards some sort of buddhist reincarnation episode where they are reborn into a new body john malkovich and slowly but surely everybody will become a part of this personthis movie is so weird funny and deals with so many strange concepts that it is impossible to get all of it in one viewing as i have done so unfortunately i cannot say much more about it hopefully when i see it again i might be able to explain more about it so i will deal with it then,black_comedy
is really a one in a kind never seen anything quite like it but there are many strange films out there and that a film is different doesnt necessarily make it a good one is very strange but it is also just as goodthe story is like completely insane but manages to keep getting more and more interesting the longer it goes never knowing what is to come next the plot is exciting at all time but what i found a strong point was the characters all the actors are great in creating characters as unpredictable as the rest of the movie i feel there is no one that is really a good guy and neither a big bad one not a bad thing like many movies with characters one cant relate too because here the roles have such substance an the interest for seeing what will happen and what move they make next keeps me on the edge of my seat at all time eventough this is a film that interest in all its weirdness i feel that is more a character driven picture john cusack and cameron diaz are so greatly unpredictable hard to fully get a hold of and catherine keener is really disturbing but in a good way for the film john malkovich himself is great in making himself feel even more awkward than the audience about what is going on he is funny and one even comes to get some kind of bond to him brilliant dark comedy it is funny and interesting in all its weirdness and disturbing sad and will somewhat mess with your head specially the psychological aspects delivered by the characters unlike many weird films manages to deliver much more than just awkwardness charlie kaufman delivers a script unlike anything else and director spike jonze with amazing performances form the cast creates a completely unique film everybody needs to experience,black_comedy
there are some films whose plots are so obvious from the very beginning that it is a wonder why they are even made you know the movies the ones that begin once upon a time and end with happily ever after and to a certain extent there is a chain of events that most films follow whether they mean to or not is not such a film if the film posterwhich shows an auditorium filled with the actor john malkovich head in front of various bodiesmakes you feel strange or makes you say that looks too weird for me then this may not be what you are looking for if you are someone however who wants to see something very abnormal very original and very brilliant then welcome feel free to jump inside of the head of john malkovichthis is a crazy film and the worst thing to do to a crazy film is to reveal too much of the plot it starts off with a struggling puppeteer named craig schwartz who finds an advertisement in the newspaper for a man with very fast fingers as he is used to working with his hands this is the perfect job opportunity for him on the first day of work he finds that his office building is located on the 7  floor which can only be opened when the elevator is stopped between the 7th and 8th floor and a metal wrench is inserted into the doors of the elevator shortly after working there he discovers that there is a portal in the office that leads to the head of actor john malkovich once inside the portal you can experience life through john malkovich for fifteen minutes this was all i knew before stepping into the world of and i believe that it is all one should know what follows is an insane film filled with great acting great directing and genius writing the characters are strange yet they eventually become very real and their uniqueness soon becomes relatable this did not feel like a film that was strange just for the sake of being strange everything that happens seems to fit perfectly as with any unique idea there is always the risk of being too ridiculous or having the results be a disaster never once does this film venture off into that territory it could have been a giant mess but instead it manages to be beautiful the motive that the characters have is one of the most universal wants there is to be able if only for a few minutes to be someone else to live life through the eyes of someone else this is a seemingly simple task it is not one of the great things that this film highlights is the domino effect that all of us are a part of we cannot live our lives without interrupting the life of someone else every action we commit affects someone which in turn affects someone else which in turn affects someone else it is a continuous circle that never stops no matter our age gender or position in life and just when we tell ourselves it cant get any stranger than this it does,black_comedy
fantastic movie i absolutely adored the plot which means that screenplay was written by some magician the film tells such an unusual story that you just cant love itthe plot is very dynamic and thoughtful controlling puppets is not the as controlling people from inside it seemed like an innocent story of a puppeteer who found a hole which takes you inside john malkovich but it turned into conspiracy of a bunch of people who use human vessels to live forever i think this marvelously told story teaches us that people have to be what they are after all this is a great movie and i dont regret that ive given it 1010 it does worth more though,black_comedy
here it is one of the most unique movies youll probably ever watchits one of the best written scripts of all time by the always inventive writer charlie kaufman with also some totally great dialog in it its the sort of script you just cant go wrong with no matter if you tell it poorly in the actual movie the script itself still remains compelling and totally original on its own not that the story is told poorly in the movie by the way to avoid confusion despite his lack of movie making experience spike jonze shows that hes more than a capable directoralways wanted to see and feel the world through the eyes of john malkovich just go to the 7 12 floor of the mertin flemmer building and enter the door behind the cabinet this movie is weird yes but perhaps not as weird as you would expect what perhaps most surprised me was the fact that the movie tried to make sense as much as that was possible of course it tries to explain things without ever getting too philosophical or ever hard to follow its the sort of movie that can be interpreted in many ways it definitely leaves more than enough room open for that but its mostly above all a movie that you just have to take as it rolls along let things overwhelm you just the same way as the situations overwhelm and happen to the characters in the movie dont try to understand everything weird thats happening in the movie just take it all for what it is let the movie just simply draw you into this weird and unreal world its a much more accessible movie as you would expect and therefor this is a great movie to watch for basically just everyone its a rare case of a movie thats so odd that it becomes totally brilliant perhaps the only other real example of this is the kubrick classic a clockwork orange through its weirdness the movie gets also incredibly innovative and helps to make this a totally awesome viewing experience is also truly one of the coolest movies of recent years without even trying to be cool on the contrary actually most of the characters are losers who arent happy about their own current situationit also is a very hilarious movie to watch its not a movie that tries to be funny its a movie that just is funny because of its situations and the way the characters deal with them its the type of movie thats fun and hilarious in its small and subtle little things and of course the concept alone is already good enough to make you laugh it therefor also is one of the better comedies of recent years the movie probably kept me smiling all the way through i believeyoull probably have a hard time recognizing john cusack and cameron diaz at first they look so different from their normal type of roles it such a great and big difference and how great is that john malkovich plays himself in a movie with a story such as this one it takes some real guts to play a role such as this one in a way he makes fun of himself and his career just by playing himself after this movie youll probably never look as john malkovich the same way again lots of others stars also make a cameo appearance such as charlie sheen in a bigger role and sean penn and brad pitt in cameo appearances as themselves it probably only took 5 minutes of their time but its so cool they actually did thisa greatly entertaining movie you really have to see but above all experience for yourself910httpbobafett1138blogspotcom,black_comedy
how can you not watch a movie like its turned into somewhat of a classic and the reason is obvious  this movie is as controversial any movie can get it makes us laugh on how the basic premise is idiotic and childish and yet it fulfills the dream that many of us dream all the time  being a hollywood celebrity turning from ourselves  that even though sometimes we could be successful and have a great life  into someone we assume is better than us in every way with its somewhat philosophical idea  do we really want to be someone were not change our lives but risk our sanity our way of life our friends our family  combined with great acting humorfilled scenes especially the excellent scene where john malkovich enters his own head and finds himself in the world where everyone are him and speak the mysterious language of malkovich and the wonderful scene where maxine tells lotte that she is her babys father create what can only be called as a masterpiece though its delusional insane and irrational idea in every way  especially when you think about the finishing scene where craig enters the head of john malkovichs daughter and so creates some sort of an edipal complex this movie is one people will remember for years to come because lets face it this movie is what every audience is looking for,black_comedy
this is without a doubt the most genius film i have ever seen my hats off to spike jonze and charlie kaufman for taking a risk and making this filmthe title basically sums up the general plot depressive puppeteer john cusack finds a job on the 7 and a half floor of a building when he turns up to work the floor is only half a storey high and no one seems to make sensehis job leads him to find a portal in the form of the small door the portal leads the person into john malkovichs head for 15 minutes before being dropped on the new jersey turnpike after trying to market this product john cusacks character gets bored and decides to permanently take over malkovich to see what kind of life he would leadafter reading that quick summary of the plot you must be thinking how can a film with such a stupid and bizarre plot be any good i ensure you that the sheer originality of this film will keep you entertained the plot script acting and humour are all top notch in this film overally delivering one of the greats of cinema history1010,black_comedy
i dont believe ive ever seen a movie that i had such a hard time understanding every second of yet was drawn to at the same time from the very first frame to the last the film is bizarre and weird the characters all act in a way that is quite hard to decode is probably the most accurate word here some act entirely uninhibited some just act plain weird i gathered that the whole portal into john malkovichs head was a metaphor but i couldnt make sense of all of the film the plot is interesting and unbelievably bizarre and quite difficult to follow the pacing is a little slow but that might just be because i had such a hard time understanding what was going on and why the film has some truly memorable scenes and even a few memorable lines ill never forget the famous restaurant malkovich scene and i doubt anyone else whove seen it will the whole idea is great and i think its fairly original as well i didnt understand all of it but i suppose i would if i were older and had experienced a situation similar to that of one or more of the main characters i would understand their actions more this is a hard movie to comment on especially since i dont entirely understand it i will say that while i found the ending to be slightly unsatisfyingwhich can probably be attributed to my being too used to hollywood endings i liked the deep insightful commentary on love and emotions what else is there to say i might not be making a good case for the film but i really do recommend you to watch it if nothing else its a great unique movie that makes you really think a very weird movie but a very good one as well i recommend it to just about anyone who is up for a new twist on one of the old lovestory formula and a good story that boils down to one of the most common fears among us humans if you think you might like the movie for whatever reason go see it if you are smart enough to appreciate something slightly different from what youre used to see in hollywood films youll most likely enjoy this 810,black_comedy
ive seen quite a lot of movies including some weird ones lost highway for instance but this one is by far the weirdest that ive ever seen there just arent enough words to fully describe this moviea puppeteer doesnt earn enough money as an artist so he needs to find a real job he finds an ad in a newspaper reacts and is hired immediately the only problem is that the offices are on the 75th floor and the walls are only half as high as in a normal office during his work he discovers a secret door behind a filing cabinet opens it and sees a tunnel he enters the tunnel and ends up in the head of the actor john malkovich for about 15 minutes he sees what the man sees and can steer his reactions thoughts and words after the 15 minutes he falls out of the sky somewhere in a field outside of the cityat first i just couldnt get used to the whole concept of the movie but after a while it felt normal i dont know how the writer ever came up with the idea but at least you can be sure that he didnt copy it from someone else oh well i really had a good time watching it and i give it an 8510 perhaps the score might even go up as i see it a few more times,black_comedy
im at a loss for words with this film how does something so odd so unique not get any mention in the annals of brilliance and genius hollywood maybe has seven or eight types of movie ideas that are repeated ad nauseum but somehow managed to stay away from those predetermined molds spike jonz made a fine effort in his film debut and the whole conundrum of the film created an interesting question this film could easily have been some cornball flick called being tom cruise or something yet it stayed true to its form commenting on our obsessiveness to be someone else to be something greater than our 95 jobs and big screen tvs so many things to talk about and so many things to look at a second time,black_comedy
j cusak hasnt starred in a good movie since better off dead  this movie wasnt funny or good  it was different ill give it that  i like the idea of looking through someone elses eyes but it gets old quick  if you liked high fidelity which i cant understand why then youd probably enjoy this train wreck of a film  enjoy,black_comedy
i love because i havent seen a movie like it its extremely original and beautiful the puppeteering was fantastic and unique in a movieand john malkovichis hysterical he is no doubt of the best actors of all time after he made this movie,black_comedy
this movie is one of my personal inspirations  everything in this movie gleamed with perfection from the acting to writing from directing to cinematography and production design  if you havent seen this film drop everything and go rent it,black_comedy
i had wanted to see this film but when i saw it i near couldnt keep my eyes openin the start i thought it was great and superbbut after a 40 minutes you get bored and think that its just a bad filmvery overrated 310,black_comedy
note over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book cut to the chaise lounge or i cant believe i swallowed the remote get it at amazonthis is a strikingly original film that is part science fiction part love triangle romance and part comedy with an undercurrent of psychological insight into human relationships marred slightly by some familiar elements in the resolution charlie kaufman who wrote the script and spike jonze who directed are to be commend for being so daring and free with the usual notions of reality while callously demonstrating just how selfish human relationships can be to analyze this film is very much beside the point but im going to do a little bit of that anywayjohn cusack stars as an out of work puppeteer with a cheating heart cameron diaz is his hardworking mousey little wife who supports him and a menagerie of animals including a chimpanzee ensconced in their new york apartment an early scene shows her going off to work while cusack rolls over and goes back to sleep catherine keener enters the scene with her big smile and long legs as a supremely confident amoral user of people and quickly becomes the focus of the triangle as both cusack and diaz fall in madly in love with her she however is not so enamored she is not attracted to cusack at all and tells him so and finds diaz interesting but only after seeing her adoring eyes inside the eyes of john malkovich who plays himselfoffbeat enough not yet cusack has met keener through his new job as a fastfingered file clerk at a data storage firm with offices on the seventh and a half floor in a new york high rise the floor is just about four and a half feet high low overhead so that everybody has to bend over whenever they stand up orson bean plays the head of the firm who is 110 years old or so with mary kay place as his annoying secretary while filing cusack drops a folder behind a filing cabinet he pulls out the cabinet and lo and behold discovers a little alice in wonderland door he opens it and crawls forward in the dark and swoosh is drawn into the person of actor john malkovich who is going about his daily life cusack looks out and sees what john is seeing hears what john is hearing experiences what john is experiencing he isokay we have our strikingly original premise where the film goes from here is the tough part it includes some funny shtick and some intriguing ideas about identity a prospect for immortality malkovich being turned into a puppet some unusual sex games a couple of appearances by charlie sheen as his contemporary self and later as a balding middle aged man ending with the resolution of the triangle and a hint of a possible sequel i was entertained mainly because of the strong performances by keener cusack malkovich and diaz i was somewhat disappointed that the last part of the film did not live up to the beginning in terms of originality the old people waiting for rebirth reminded me of something out of cocoons 1985 but cusacks prospective life as a little girl was a chuckle to contemplate and i couldnt help but applaud keeners sly triumph but enough of these beguiling hints about what happens see it for yourself,black_comedy
before i watched this movie tonight there was one movie that i thought was flawless  casablanca it was a great movie but i still found it lack something it wasnt the movie just me and theres certainly nothing lack in brilliantly directed excellent script and just the right cast i didnt know cameron diaz was this good  this film is testament to the power of film,black_comedy
when i saw this movie first i was really speechless i could only laugh i love everything surrealistic but this movie breaks everything i saw before first of all there are amazing acting performances especially by catherine keener and cameron diaz but also by john cusack and  people seem to forget about him  john malkovich then the story is so crazy and insane but still offers thousands of possibilities to interpret it and to guess what sense it could make this film should have won an oscar at least for its uniqueness and charles kaufman and spike jonze should soon make another film together,black_comedy
the best of the wizard of oz dead of night the cabinet of dr caligari greed le chien andalou splash cocoon cabaret citizen kane take the money and run the producers heaven can wait and i couldnt catch what else are skillfully woven together to create a movie that has designed for its characters not one uniquely amazing world but many  the supporting cast is magnificent across the board  orson bean is particularly delightful and believable keenan and diaz are pure magic together  but malkovich himself gives one of the greatest performances in the history of film  how could he have not been nominated for supporting actor for this  he reflects so much and so many changes seamlessly as perfection itself  a truly original film  i wonder what spike jonze could possibly do for an encore thats even more nonconventional than this,black_comedy
will be one cinematic experience that you will treasure forever this is definitely the most inventive film that has come out in a very long time this is  in the line of fire of the great films of 1999 its wittiness will find a place in your heart john cusacks performance is alive and full of spunk cameron diaz and catherine keener continue to do great work and that is why they are the objects of beauty of many casting agents  lets not forget dear john malkovich who at even being himself executes one of the best performances of the year also both director spike jonze and screenplay writer charlie kaufman both highly deserve oscar nominations what is this movie about you ask well i hate to inform you but this time i wont be the liaison in describing the film because it will be very dangerous for me to do that what you say just be john malkovich and find out excellent,black_comedy
what makes us ordinary people interested in celebrities one factor is that celebrities seem to have more interesting lives than the rest of us hence we cant help wondering what it would be like to be one this movie asks how would it feel to be a moderately famous and very good actor for a while not surprisingly while others might be content to go along for the ride the protagonist here craig schwartz john cusack being a puppetmaster by profession wants to take over the film is set in new york the town where success and failing success celebrity is of supreme importance craig unable to make a living as a puppeteer gets a mundane filing job in an old and rather odd office in the office craig stumbles on a way a portal to put people into the actor john malkovichs head for 15 minutes at a time with his coworker maxine he finds there is no shortage of customers at 200 a visit but the effect on craigs and his wife lotties relationship is both unexpected and dramaticas for john horatio malkovich he graciously goes along for the ride as well allowing himself to be sent up in various amusing ways having discovered what craig and maxine are up to he forces his way through the queue and puts himself into his own mind guess how the world appears in a word malkovichian he even allows a few  possibly notional subconscious skeletons eg ridicule suffered as a sensitive child to be exposedit turns out craig is not the only person who knows about the portal and hey if youre old and ugly what better way to renew yourself than to take over a celebrity one could sum this up as the lion the witch and the wardrobe meets coccon really the film is a very funny look at the notion of fame and the question of identity can you be yourself even though you are in someone elses body the suggestion is that you can but you might do a lot better with the right one theres a wonderful sendup of the unctious showbiz documentary after malkovich with craig in charge switches to puppeteering to great critical acclaim leaving several other celebrities including brad pitt and sean penn looking a bit forlornjohn cusack plays craig with wonderfully dishevelled conviction and is well supported by cameron diaz who is practically unrecognisable as the equally dishevelled animal loving lotte catherine keener as the mercenary maxine has a rather unsympathetic character and some good lines she radiates the required sex appeal though i liked orson bean as the rather unbelievable 105yearold principal of the filing company whose courtly manners are a thin veneer for his raging hormones as for mr malkovich he plays himself as your average fastidious fairly precious actor a persona that may or may not be near the truth but is pretty plausible there is one gem of a scene where malkovichcraig tells his slick agent carlos jacott that he is switching to puppeteering the agent doesnt bat an eyelid  acting for an insane john malkovich is still better than representing a talented nobody sure says the agent just let me call a couple of peoplethe ending of the movie is a bit odd i got the impression that most of the packed audience at the showing i went to did not realise what had happened there is no obvious link between our last sight of craig standing by a ramp onto the new jersey turnpike the exit from the portal and the final voiceover overall though funny fresh well executed and entertaining,black_comedy
being john malkovichsome films released nowadays strive to be essentially original and in no way interesting while is both original and interesting  to a certain degree  it is in no way a great moviejohn cusack plays a puppeteer named craig whom is married to a frizzlehaired woman named lotte cameron diaz they live in a small apartment with exotic animals including iguanas parrots and a chimp named elijah which has a repressed mental problemcusacks character gets a job in the classifieds as filer for a company with small overhead literally he lusts after a fellow worker named maxine catherine keener but she ignores himone day while hes working a file drops behind a cabinet and when he goes to retrieve it he finds a small door leading into a dark vessel much like the rabbit hole in alice in wonderlandafter crawling through the holeinthewall craig finds that it leads into john malkovichs head yes thats right john malkovichs head anyone who enters can see out of malkovichs head for fifteen minutesand maybe longerafter telling lotte and his fellow associate maxine about his wonderful and exuberating experience craig is lured into opening a small business centered entirely on the hole in the wall and soon people from all over are entering john malkovichs head for a large feebut pretty soon chaos ensues and diazs character is entering malkovichs head so she can be with other women and as all this happens malkovich begins to suspect that something is going on  he is losing control over his own body but why  and howthe film really has no sense of reality it starts out with an odd feeling but it is enjoyable everything is symbolic and the surroundings bring out emotions in the characters its a bit like the beginning of joe versus the volcano where hanks practically lives in that stuffy office remember how dark and dank the office was thats what john cusacks office in the film is like  everyone must crouch over as to not hit the ceiling but much like joe versus the volcano the movie begins to withdraw itself into just plain crazy nothing makes sense at all and the film starts to achieve a sick sense of reality diaz turns into a lesbian for one thing and the film treats it like it is normalfor example when diaz is having an affair with keener and cusacks character knows about it he doesnt seem to care a whole lot about the fact that his wife is cheating on him it just doesnt make sense reallybut ill give the film the fact that it is strangely original and startlingly provocative i mean really who ever thought about making a film where someone enters john malkovichs head and what about all the stuff later in the film it is more than original  it is just plainweirdjohn cusack does a great job as craig he looks like a sixties hippy with his long greasy hair and geeky countenancecameron diaz is completely dissolved in her character she looks so ugly and different in this film that you think is that really hercatherine keener who was just in s1m0ne with al pacino definitely got her career kickstarted out of this film i dont recall seeing her in many things before this movieand john malkovich iswelljohn malkovichdirector spike jonze does a good thing with the idea he is given and the film uses so many ideas that they could fill at least ten movies themselves unfortunately because of the way the film turns out to be i didnt enjoy it that muchmaybe i didnt love it because i expected so much and because it lost me half way through i followed it in the beginning and understood how everything was symbolic but after the halfway point the film starts to not really make any sense and just gets weird in one scene we see some individuals running through malkovichs subconscious  what a weird sceneyou know those dreams that you have sometimes  the kind of dreams that make absolutely no sense at all but while youre having the dream everything seems normal thats what is  one of those weird dreams that make no sense but seem like they make perfect sense while youre dreaming them almostunfortunately while the filmmakers treated the film like it made absolute sense while filming it the audience can tell it doesnt make sense while they watch it  it is such that the audience is a bystander of the filmmakers dreamthe director and actors of are having this dream and to them it makes sense but to the audience it doesnt because we are watching the dream from the outside  and that is perhaps the biggest fault of the filmbut it is nevertheless one of the strangest movies i have ever seen and i have to give it some kind of credit for that to not do so would be ignorant35 stars john ulmer,black_comedy

what on earth does floor 75 have to do with anything not a bad idea but tails off into navelgazing and with no sense of direction or endingweird does not equate to worthwhilei bought the dvd because id seen a small bit of the movie on tv and thought it looked interesting howeverthe extra on the dvd  the interview with the socalled director  says it all he pretends to be suffering a gigantic hangover pretends to vomit outside his car and thats itnot alternative comedy  just alternativei gave it 3 stars for trying god knows why,black_comedy
a street puppeteer craig is down on his luck and gets a job in an office filing papers  one day he discovers a small doorway behind one of the cabinets  he goes in to find himself inside the head of actor john malkovich  seeing and hearing from inside his head  in an attempt to impress coworker maxine he shows her and they decide to rent the experience out to people  however maxine becomes obsessed with malkovich and craig tries to stay in malkovich and work him like a puppet  despite the concerns of his girlfriend lotteits hard to sell this movie without sounding nuts  in 40 years this film will be on the imdb message boards with people trying to work out if they dreamed it or if it was real  although the plot is insane it is actually a funny and moving film that is very clever  the film has a moving desperation about it as each character longs to be someone else  the final shot is heartbreaking  the plot may well be full of holes but its so surreal you cant expect it all to make sense  even within its own logiccusack is excellent and this was part of a very good run of films for him he is delicate and weak just as hes supposed to be  diaz is better than usual and is barely recognisable keener steals the show as maxine giving an ott sort of performance  malkovich himself is really good playing himself  he is the brunt of a few gags and he seems to love itoverall this is worth watching simply because it is so very different to anything else youll see in the multiplex  outside of the novelty value it still manages to be a moving funny film,black_comedy
is one of those innovative films that come along only rarely for reasons that become clear in the second half of the movie there in fact is a portal that allows people to enter and spend exactly 15 minutes in john malkovichs mind  what happens when a puppeteer enters and discovers he can learn to actually control malkovich  what happens when malkovich finds out about the portal and actually enters his own mindthis movie is total fantasy no real message just fun entertainment it is wellacted and welldirected i personally give it 9 of 10 for total enjoyment  however if one were really to get down to a ranking of recent movies there are a whole host of recent movies eg shakespeare in love a simple plan fargo lone star the matrixamerican history x saving private ryan etc that in my opinion are in total better movies  still see if you havent yet it is really great funi viewed the dvd  although very nice the extras are fairly lame by current dvd extra standards,black_comedy
although the acting overall was superb particularly by the four leads the storyline was almost proudly obscure and the dark atmosphere and lighting did not help one bitsorry but exclusive of the acting i could see no reason for any sort of award or even watching it,black_comedy
charlie kauffman is a genius and is a testament to that a unique idea but the zaniness is a bit too much to overcome not the directors fault though spike jonzes filmography is defined by the offbeat and probably could be his most straightforward or accessible film but if so was the intention then he could have made this into a more box office friendly film the drab settings and production design and the bleak outlook dampened the mood the acting is good throughout and john malkovich is very good playing a scared version of himself and as mentioned at the start the idea is absolutely class,black_comedy

as a fan of mindbending films like eternal sunshine of the spotless mind and memento i was recommended this one on netflix and decided to give it a try unfortunately after being intrigued by the trailer i found that this movie is not all all what is advertisedfor a basic plot summary sees an eccentric puppeteer jon cusack finding a portal that leads into the mind of actor john malkovich john malkovich chaos then ensues when the experience is turned into a profitmaking ventureput simple this is an artsy concept film if ever one was created many themes in the film are interesting and have potential to really intrigue but all are eschewed in favor of oblique artistic expression basically it is impossible to ever figure out this film the characters are outlandish the plot is all over the place and the themes are far too frequent and passing to piece together coherentlyi liken the experience to watching stanley kubricks the shining the visuals are nice and the content seems thoughtprovoking but youll go stark raving mad if you actually try to figure everything out for director spike jonze the overall artistic expression far outweighs a coherent narrativethus if you are a fan of outofthebox visually striking filmmaking this will be your citizen kane if however like me you prefer some sense and stability you will be disappointed especially with the way it is advertised,black_comedy
at first i was sceptical about this film because of the mixed things i had heard about it but less than a few minutes in i could see this was a masterpiece of spike jonze alreadythe ideas and concepts in this film are although ridiculous are so unique john malkovich gives an excellent performance despite playing himself his character is very different to the real man and is great when playing himself being controlled by other characters craig and dr lester this film also has one of my favourite twist endings of all times and left me surprised for quite a duration jonze provides a great piece of art with some cringe moments that baffles me to how his mind comes up with these fantastic ideas lastly this film is very underrated obviously having its flaws like most films it does not have the well deserved rating it should have,black_comedy
charlie kaufman is a one of a kind storyteller and for years now has been one of the most beguiling uniquely creative voices in film a man whose entire thought process and writing technique truly lie in a realm thats perpetually out of the box now his stuff isnt for everyone particularly the average filmgoer who isnt ready to sing or rather think for their supper so to speak when it comes to payoff but for those willing theres cerebral wealth hidden pockets of emotional truth and endless story beats that play out like curveball eureka moments and make us ever curious as to how the map of the mans brain plays out when hes spinning his work whether a bona fide masterwork eternal sunshine of the spotless mind an all timer for me or a cacophonic dud adaptation a painfully nonsensical misfire the guys pen never strays into generic narrative mud is perhaps his oddest entry yet and believe me its hard to settle on one to occupy that pedestal in this one john cusack plays a bedraggled puppeteer who lands a job at a weirdo company called lestercorp a five foot tall office space located in between the 7th and 8th floors of a high rise their he meets sexy catherine keener who throws a wrench in his lifeless marriage to frumpy pet store owner cameron diaz thats nothing compared to the films central plot though a trip into a head scratching metaphysical twilight zone thats equal parts amusing and disturbing cusack inadvertently finds a hidden portal which leads directly into the mind of movie star john malkovich for a few minutes at a time before dumping the cranial voyager out on the new jersey turnpike its a concept so off the wall and disarming that you kind of have no choice but to roll with the punches and see where it goes out of sheer curiosity alone malkovich plays himself in belligerent over anunciating glory and the scene where he inevitably ventures into the portal himself is deranged brilliance worthy of the surrealist hall of fame not all of kaufmans quirks come out unscathed as we begin to see the deliberation to be weird for the sake of weird shine through the frays in the blanket of authentic inspiration but when it works it really works riding a wave of restrained absurdity that kicks into outright mania when you least expect it,black_comedy
i dont know what i expected with this movie but it certainly wasnt that nevertheless it was a lot of fun to watch is weird not just your average weird with loud noises and the such or weird to the point of not making any sense it makes sense for the most part but it still manages to be extremely confusing why is it confusing because i wonder what spike jonze was thinking when he made this or even how he had the idea the idea is really original but what jonze decided to do with it was just odd why of all things would you make it about that now im not complaining it actually turned out pretty stinking funny but it just makes you wonder how this idea popped into jonzes head and who looked at this and thought sounds like a good idea lets make a movie out of it i wonder how john malkovich himself felt about it too overall is just weird i really dont know what else i could say and i feel like just an average review would make this movie out to be average when its anything but this movie is original funny interesting weird and just about anything else you wouldnt expect its a movie that although didnt always make sense wasnt made to be analyzed in the end i would definitely recommend to every weird person that i know,black_comedy

spike jonze and charlie kaufman never seem to shy away from going weird but amazingthe story is about a skillful puppeteer finds the perfect puppet when he discovers a portal in his new office on a half floor it leads him literally into the brain of john malkovich he and his discoverer try make a living off of others interests while his wife becomes jealouscharlie kaufman and spike jonze are the two people that can take a weird and strange story and make it amazingly well made and as a viewer you some how correct to it with no reason to it i dont think i ever came across a bad movie from these genius of directing and writing and is another great film from them they never disappoint methe one thing that i loved about this movie is how self aware it is it knows its weird with some of the scenes that will kind of question yourself for watching it but not in a horrible way more like im i weirdo for understanding this and also enjoying it something like the film has a sense of humor to itself and knows it ridiculous but it goes along with it and man is it funnythe director from spike jonze once again dose an amazing job directing this movie he mix the humor weird scenes and the fantasy element to it which perfectly came together so well and smoothly spike jonze is fantastic director and in this he really dose shine with his talent of presenting story telling the writing in this movie is probably hands down the best writing ive seen in a while the way they pulled off this crazy story line and make it comedy gold is truly genius and worth bringing up because its not a easy thing to do as it seems impossible for some writers out there and kaufman makes it look easythe acting from everyone was excellent john cusack catherine keener and cameron diaz all three did brilliant in their roles john malkovich pretty much playing himself in this movie did a funny performance as himself has he gets taken over by pretty much everyone i would pay good money to see john malkovich been given the script for the first time to this movie while he knows nothing about it yet and him reading it and seeing his face has it probably went into wtf mode but he said yes anywhere because the movie is about him and he give a outstanding performancefor problems i dont really have any to be honest i couldnt really find anything that i thought wasnt right well overall is smart weirdly amazing movie with a fantastic script and outstanding directing,black_comedy
wow its one hell of a ridei didnt know till the first hour where the plot that has been built up will lead to and in the next it had much more than i had thought a simple puppeteers life is in shackles with the truth he has learnt but will be like that forever or will it become normal again as it happens in hollywood movies a happy family is shattered with an incident but it stays happy in the end with a compromise or resolution or somethingbut no not hereas i promised i am not going to reveal the story herebut even if i did for this its a must experience movie as it has too many things involvedthere is this puppeteer craig schwartz who gets a job in a rather mysterious 712 but well explained in a 2 minute tv show floor and finds out that actually there is a way that leads to the brain of john malkovich simple on paper it may seem but the entire transformation and revelations begin then he learns that his wife is transsexualhis colleague whom he wanted to make love with actually wants to sleep with john malkovich with his wife in his head he is lost totallyhe then cages his wife and goes into malkovich head and makes love with his colleagueand yes the puppeteer comes nowhe realizes that he could control his actions and does soyes by touching her colleagues left boob at willbut having said all thisthere are more surprises leftwhat if malkovich himself entered the head of malkovich that is sorted outeverything becomes malkovicheverything seen and heard is just malkovichwowa crazy idea and yes it is right to an extentwhenever i thought too much about my own self i could see myself doing something it was an illusion but this aspect is really thrilling to know and may also make one go crazyanyways back to plotit is nowcraig wants to stay in malkovich forever and does sohe makes malkovich a success full puppeteerand earns moneylives the life of a millionaire kindnow his colleague is pregnant rightly so as they have been making love but waitagain a surpriseok now a bit or retrospection and inquisitive engrossed too much into the thing that what would happen next i almost lost that why was there a portalonly for malkovich or why basically there is a way into his headits learnt later and its related to construction of 712 floor thats a hintits a clear movieit seems to solve the answers that it has raised itselfand yet it still ends ask many more psychological questionswhat would it be if we are in another soul feels it feels see what it sees hear what it hearsman this is a crazy thingbut an experience to experiment withhaving almost revealed the entire story or plot the acting is top notch and realistic even in this highly fictitious drama john cusack as craig just excels he must have practiced pup petering a lot for thisand so did john malkovichcameron diaz lives as if she has been living with her pets the chimpanzee a dog a bird for agesthere are other animalslike a chameleon tooand the witch dont know its a right thing to say played by catherine keener is just rightand even the other actors perform aptlyall said and above kudos to writer charlie kaufman for writing such a thing and for spike jonze for accepting to make it and making it so engaginglyits a must take ride one must be someone elserating 55,black_comedy
as many reviews have stated being out there does not make a classic having a great cast does not make a classic having an original story which this is not does not make a classicits not possible to connect with the characters in any way at all there is minimum character development worst of all is the ending which makes you question why you ever watched this moviepeople who say that you need to be an intellectual and blah blah blah to like this movie need to just admit that they like this movie only because it makes them feel different and superior its like those people who review wines and what passes for fashion on the rampavoid at all costs it took me 4 sittings to finish this movie it was that bad,black_comedy
one can never doubt after perceive the name charlie kaufman on the screen that in the following moments your mind will be sagaciously intellectually and emotionally played when a man with such talent on writing decides to unleash his artistic sensibility the result will hardly be ordinary can easily be defined as a modern fairy tale presenting all distinctive ingredients such as fantastic yet rustic elements with whimsical characters wrapped on quickpaced storytelling all converging to the constant variation of feelings and a possible final insightpersonally my final classification would be far from the comedy label that was fed to me before watch the film its definitely closer to a horror movie considering the wretched outcome most characters end up in aside from an excellent really funny scene malkovich the whole movie is a downward path on personage psyche human flaws needs desires and sentiments dealt on a crude manner represented by the door of becoming someone else the ending can be considered distressful when we realize that malkovich is doomed to perpetuate his existence on the void of his own mind or craig schwartz emotionally shattered forced to contemplate others bliss due to his absence through a childs eyesas uncomfortable as the sense of ruthless injustice determined by the final scenes is it does not count negatively on the experience whatever the traces of indignation towards some outcomes may have surfaced they were genuine emotions induced by the story and at this particular department kaufman never drops the ball for the exceptional capability of attach us sentimentally to his creation imprisoning the viewer on the plot perhaps its the identification that every person has regarding egoistical selfcentered and bitter personal characteristics but the result is that is effective all the time when presented properlyyes this movie can touch us this deep the synergy of characters and situations drag us to a state of reflection as amphibian by bjrk carry the ending credits and that state however glad melancholic or even just shocked is a prerequisite for every film to be always remembered closely,black_comedy
is a really strange but interesting movie i dont know if id ever feel the need to watch it again but i think its worth checking out if you have the timejohn cusack cameron diaz catherine keener and of course john malkovich all turn in pretty good performances here its kind of nice to see cameron diaz not have to get all glammed up for a movie role for once although her characters story arc still surrounds itself with sex so i suppose its not such a big change for her after allthe thing i probably liked about this movie the most was the fact that i hadnt seen anything else like it before in a time where nearly everything you see is a remake of something youve already seeni was glad to be able to watch something completely differentthe puppeteering in the movie was pretty impressive obviously it wasnt really john cusack doing it nor john malkovich but it was still pretty cool they really made the puppets seem alivei dont really have anything more to say about this movie give it a shot if you wantits not bad its kind of weird though so just know that going in if youre like me and are tired of all the retreadstry this on for size,black_comedy
what a title i really didnt know what to expect exactly  an introspective film some kind of intellectual drama essentially trying to capture the existential issues of the titular actors tormented mind i didnt think of a fantasy anyway and certainly didnt anticipate this piece of cinematic creativity and visual awesomeness my mind would endure for less than two hours is not only one of the most creative movies of the last 20 years but certainly one of the cleverest and most mindbending and twisted scripts ever concocted from a newcomer his name is charlie kauffman and this is definitely one of these reviews that must start by a thunder of verbal applauds for the writingthough the movie is not the most quotable of all like network or chinatown it features more similarities with scripts  la rashomon or the usual suspects these intricate puzzles where you have to assemble each piece until the end but in the case of its less about a resolution or a revelation than how far a movie can exploit an inventive concept how long it can hook the audiences minds with an ingenious plot device this is why the script is actually closer to movies like back to the future and groundhog day and when the plot consists on having people being in someone elses body let alone john malkovich well besides the thrills besides the laughs the movie should feature a necessary level of depth indeed when you have such a goldmine for plot twists you must handle them carefully and on that level charlie kauffman did it with a remarkable craftsmanship and even if you expect to be surprised its nothing compared to the exhilarating cinematic experience of the first viewingthe symbolism that structures the whole narrative is highlighted during the opening credits where you discover a marvelous puppets number directed by greg schwartz john cusack whose appearance immediately labels him in the antihero slash loser category greg is so devoured by his own passion that hes totally neglecting his couple and despite the apparent love between greg and his wife lotte theres the strong feeling that both belong to two different worlds he works in the basement taking care of his puppets with the delicacy of a godlike figure caring about his creations while lotte live with her animals on the top creating a touching minizoo in the house the only similarity between the two is their looks by the way only after the first half hour i realized it was cameron diaz below that huge afro even though shes not the most feminine cinematic character she genuinely wants children but greg seems reluctant because of his unemployment which lotte understands  the film doesnt waste its time with these two wannabeanything and quickly gets to the point when greg replies to a job offergregs skillful hands get him the job in a peculiar and mysterious filling company set in the 7th and half floor probably the lowest roof from any work place go figure why kauffman decided to insert an element that wouldnt have changed much the plot i guess this is the difference between talented and great directors the low roof element created a bit of visual jokes to distract us before the third element of the future love triangle makes her entrance catherine keener as maxine gregs ambitious sexy coworker she talks straightforwardly and doesnt embarrass herself with social hypocrisy for a man who lives with a girl like lotte now i understand why cameron diaz had to look anything but sexy he naturally falls in love with the scenestealing maxine but shes not interested now all the pieces are ready and the game can start when greg accidentally discovers a strange tunnel that leads to john malkovichs body why malkovich how does it work why fifteen minutes in his body thats the charm did you really want to know why the groundhog day was repeating itself i was so delighted by the premise i couldnt wait to see where this would get until the intelligences highlight of the film was reached when lotte was john malkovich and when what followed set a whole new psychoanalytical mood the film is not about but becoming another person greg discovers the ultimate puppetry as a man who brings life to objects now he can insufflate life to a human being dictating his gestures his thoughts his sexual impulses being god in a pervert sort of way is his fantasy the sublime allegory of puppetrys beauty or is puppetry the incarnation of a sordid and lusty desire maxine doesnt need the experience because shes naturally a controlling woman and her desire is to control john malkovich while hes controlled by either greg or lotte and for lotte its the epiphany the flash of realization that shes not trapped in john malkovich but in her own body discovering finally the sensation of being a man lotte loves animals she loves life its all about the sensation of living again while greg uses people as objects to satisfy his personal impulses maxine is simply torn between these two approaches which might explain why she appealed to both greg and lottethe movie reveals our deepest fantasies or sexual torments the desire to be the same person in another body sometimes from a different sex to have one person we love in another body  in both cases its about the distinction between the mind and the body as a source of discomfort or satisfaction and john malkovichs body is the humble setting of a mindblowing experimentation highlighting our conditions as clumsy puppets directed by our consciences whose strings are pulled by our subconscious or by other persons or by sex by god you name them a anyway the result is an existential masterpiece questioning our own control on our livesmalkovich,black_comedy
in all reality this is just one of the weirdest movies ive ever seen yes there is weirder out there but this one makes no sense in the beginning you see john cusack as a puppeteer and well no one cares that he is doing it or people hate him for it then he applies at this job on the 7 12 floor at this point in the movie you like the weirdness john has a monkey for god sake its good weird but later in the story the weirdness just stops being creative and just becomes lame and boringthe acting in this is good no one was terrible but besides john malkovich all the other characters are unlikeable either they are in love with this horrible women who uses people or they use john malkovich to get what they wantthe story does have a interesting plot going into someones head and either seeing the world through there eyes or controlling them all through this portal in a office my problem was they didnt play off the portal or really explain why it is only malkovich that it goes tonow i have been dogging this movie but i didnt hate it but i didnt like it either if you saw this over someones house or on tv for free you wouldnt hate it but if you rent this i feel like i was disappointed with the out come of the characters and how none of them changed for the better in the movie,black_comedy
this is one of the quirkiest movies ive ever seen and i love it for that very reason there are unconventional characters abound like craig john cusack a failed puppeteer who yearns for something different in his life lotte cameron diaz a peculiar homely wife who has much the same desires as does craig and maxine catherine keener a woman whose resolute and blunt nature makes her a perfect seductress to both of the aforementioned charactersi never knew quite where the story was going to go next which is exactly what i crave to see in movies  a bit of whimsy first craig becomes a file clerk then he discovers a mysterious portal which of all things transports you into the head of john malkovich the philosophical ideas that this movie recycles are fascinating what does it mean to be yourself why are so many people so attracted to the idea of being another person to the effect that they view it as some sort of fantasy ride and is this identity substitution ethical given that malkovich himself was bothered by this phenomenon and the idea of prolonging ones life through another person  what does that say about the value of life versus death for a philosophical mind like myself raises all sorts of intriguecraigs magnetic attraction to maxine is a portrayal of how a large number of people feel who are chained to a marriage its human nature to want the forbidden fruit especially when its as intellectually challenging and striking as maxine is craig is willing to drop his homedwelling wife in an instant if he can feel the rush of maxines constant presence and lotte perhaps not so coincidentally is just the same the main thesis of probably is that people will forgo almost anything to be somebody else even if its only temporary people want that new perspective theyd never been able to see perhaps to see what has changed and determine what is real and what is slanted through point of view craigs working with puppets may be an allusion to this as he tries his best to emulate other individuals that he knows by creating marionettes resembling them the film could be a suggestion that in the eyes of humans existence supersedes identity as so many are apparently willing to subsist in the limited realm of another persons mind whatever the intent of writer charlie kaufman may have been is an daring eccentric adventure that no one will ever forget,black_comedy
the move is now instantly one of my top favorites the thoughts behind this film are so large powerful and thought provoking as well as being a film that can evoke just as complex thoughts for the viewer the cast is equally as phenomenal as the film especially john malkovich next is the awe inspiring and beautifully done cinematography and editing the whole setting of being realistic and ordinary and making something extraordinary come out of it is fantastic is a brilliant and instant classic the first subject i would like to talk about is the concepts behind the movie the major concepts are actually quite close to that of another recent movie title inception the idea that we can enter someone else bodymind and that we can be in control and live in another persons reality is what this movie is about yes they use a portal to get to that and thats where we know that this film is fiction and not real but the idea of experiencing life through another person is reality the incredible plot twists are what i love about this movie it gets you to think outside of the box put keep you close enough to reality to make you think that this is or could be believable it never loses the theme of human nature and the drive for love thats why we get dragged into any movie its our ability as a viewer to relate and empathize to the situation and the characters in the film  empathy is the act of feeling what another is feeling being able to share that experience thats what this movies about being someone else and feeling what they are feeling that thought i think creates love or an admiration about having something you cant have and being someone youve only dreamed of is a phenomenal film it left me satisfied in the end and the last 3 to 5 minutes of the film are very climatic it really starts for me when every one leaves john malkovich and all the old people go in it then cuts to craig where hes telling maxine he still loves her while she and lotte drive off they then fade away almost making craig seem like the bad guy then it cuts to the ending pool scene which i will not ruin i believe it is the key to the movie and one of the best endings ive seen it made me want to cry but at the same time i couldnt because i understood the meaning of the movie go watch its amazing,black_comedy
in the 1940s and 50s i was fascinated by the classic science fiction novels and short stories of the times such as works by heinlein asimov bradbury orwell aldous huxley and jules verne among others this was a distinctly different genre than star wars and star trek writer charlie kaufmans is the best film story ever of that original scifi genrenot only does it have an incredibly imaginative entertaining story the film is perfectly directed and acted despite being a comedy kaufmans screenplay demonstrates an understanding of the complexities of human emotions and even has moments of philosophical questioningin addition to starting with a great screenplay the director spike jonze and the cast are all excellent catherine keener exudes sexy manipulative bitch without relying on great beauty john malkovich gets a chance to exercise all of his acting talents charlie sheen has a cute cameo as himself as a womanizer cameron diaz was great in a role as the dowdy wife of the main protagonist an artistic puppeteer john cusack although i knew she was in the cast i didnt even recognize her in the part until late in the story,black_comedy
directed by spike jonze probably gets better every time you see it screenwriter charlie kaufman is a genius when it comes to subtle foreshadowing as well as thinking up with metaphysical comedies like this but you might be wondering what is the plot of this bizarre and brilliant movie allow me to elaboratejohn cusack is craig schwartz an insecure puppeteer who gets a job working on the seven and a half floor why would there be a floor thats only half as tall well the overhead is low of the mertonflemmer building in new york city there he meets seductive coworker maxine catherine keener who he finds much more attractive than his plain wife lotte cameron diaz and dr lester orson bean his quirky 105 year old boss who drinks lots of carrot juice for the first twentyfive minutes or so we dont even get a mention of mr malkovich until craig discovers a small door hidden behind a file cabinet containing a portal that portal lets you go inside the head of actor john malkovich playing himself to see hear and feel all that he sees hears and feels for about 15 minutes before being spat out onto the side of the new jersey turnpike craig uses this fantastic discovery for personal gain with maxine and lotte becomes fascinated too but once malkovich himself catches on things really start to get strangeyes this movie is weird and slightly surreal but spike jonze portrays it in a sort of quiet lowkey realistic way which makes the weirdness and comedy all the more memorable if youre a fan of charlie kaufman like me then you know that you do sort of have to suspend your disbelief while watching his movies granted i found it a little hard to swallow that everyone in this movie believes craig about the portal almost right away but its really just a stepping stone to keep the story moving along the characters and acting are all great and while i wouldnt really say that the humor is laughoutloud funny it leaves you with a unique feeling and becomes more evident on every viewing the movie isnt just clever and witty its often beautiful with great production values even if it is apparent at times that it was filmed in los angeles rather than new yorkwhen lotte falls onto the turnpike for the second time look in the background for some very southern californian palm trees the scene where malkovich goes through the portal into his own head aka the best scene in the movie proves through hilarious means what a low budget movie can achieve with special effects nowadaysby the time the third act rolled around i thought i had what was going to happen figured out pretty well but then the already fantastic movie suddenly gives us a great antagonist and a great unexpected ending kudos to kaufman who makes sure no subplot gets left behind not even one involving a chimpanzeeas for the title characteractor john malkovich is funny and superb as himself going through all this craziness people often call him the most sympathetic character in the story but i would have to give that honor to craig of course other people will give it to lotte or maxine or lester showing how deep and ultimately unforgettable is,black_comedy
indie cinema is often known for some really quirky and strange ideas but few can come stranger then an excellent debut film for spike jonze and charlie kaufmancraig schwartz john cusack is a skillful but unemployed puppeteer living with his petobsessed wife lotte cameron diaz struggling for money craig takes a job as a filing clerk on a strange lowceilinged 7  floor in the mertin flemmer building new york city he seems skills at the job but he falls for another worker maxine catherine keener who do not share his feelings whilst working craig finds a strange portal which allows him to be insight john malkovichs john malkovich head and his experience what he sees and feels for 15 minutes before landing by the new jersey turnpike he tells maxine who at first thinks he is mad but quickly sees it as a money making opportunity lotte too finds out and she uses the portal to live out her transgender fantasies quickly a three way conflict starts up and when malkovich starts to have some very strange experiences he is thrown into the mixin the late 90s early noughties some american films took a very surreal turn mulholland drive was an excellent example but whilst mulholland drive was played pretty straight took a much more comic approach there were funny lines throughout but jonze and kaufman use the surrealism for comic effort as well like when malkovich climbs into the portal inside his own head is a cleverly written film that is looks at the psychology of what makes the mind work and the ideas of identity this is also at times a very dark film with it characterisation and raises some dark moral questions at the end but it works because it is a very intelligence and it was well directed by jonze who knows his way around a setpiecethere is a unusual cast in this film cusack is known for being a indie star he is really well known for doing comedy he was well casted as the lead character and shows his talent diaz was unrecognisable as sad mentally confused wife who is the most tragic and sympathetic character in the piece it also shows how a difference hair style and set of clothes makes to someones appearance keener was decent as a bitchy loathsome character for most of the film but at times her acting did slip malkovich also shows he has a talent to play himself politically he is a moron but he is a very talented actor and i can set outside my political issues when watching him orson bean too was very good as the mysterious dr lester and he had excellent comic timinga very entertaining but strange film,black_comedy

well where to start the beginning seems a very good idea i first saw this film in 2000 although at my then young age i was put off by some elements of the film i generally loved it its possibly the quirkiest and strangest film i own it is surreal and has an original clever and funny plot it is rare to find a film quite like this one the acting is superb especially the title character of john malkovich cameron diaz is also worth a mention for an engaging and brilliant performance i would like to see a lot more of this sort of thing from her as opposed to the usual stuff she makes her appearance in this film proves that she can actspike jonze the films director previously made his name directing music videos was his first foray into the feature film in my opinion he has acquitted himself honourably the direction is brilliant especially a lot of the puppet sequences which were fantastic and show real skill jonze has also filled the film with quirky little touches for instance when craig first discovers floor 7 12 it is exactly 7 minutes and 30 seconds into the film while adding nothing at all to the film it does come across as a clever thought another clever clue is when lottie  diaz enters the malkovich room in lesters house if you look at the door knob it is precisely the same one as on the portal doorone of my favourite scenes of the film is when malkovich himself enters his own mind the first time i watched the film i had a due sense of horror and dread as he crawled along the little tunnel i really had no idea what was going to happen it is rare to find a moment in a film which is as clever as it is funny yet when malkovich enters his own mind we are rewarded with just a momentthe pacing of the film is excellent in films of this variety it normally works that the build up is excellent but the ending is a total let down on thus occasion i dont think that is the case at all throughout the films entire length youre eyes are glued to the screen the story moves forward at exactly the pace you want it to i never once feel desperate for the ending and i dont have any unanswered questions at the end of the film which is always a good signi must talk about john malkovich who i tghink was crucial for the film to work in my eyes had you replaced malkovich with any other big name actor the film wouldnt of worked malkovichs acting was excellent and you can clearly tell that he had fun playing a fictionalised version of himself on some omissions actors clearly go for a role they know will be fun i think that is what malkovich has done here taking on an extremely rare opportunity to portray himself well i say portray himself for that is another brilliant part of his performance how he is able to get the audience to suspend their disbelief and really believe there is someone else controlling his body actions and life i cant speak highly enough of malkovich he has taken everything in his stride and has clearly had a good time and is a very good sport for allowing certain childhood scenes to be shown when most actors would of refusedthe film does have some serious issues for example it does offer an opinion on the american publics growing obsession with celebrity and the desire to achieve fame and wealth the films tag line ever wanted to be someone else sums this up the film does show the lengths some people are willing to go to to get what they want but it does it in a light hearted and funny wayall this said there admire things about the film i dont like the surrealism at times goes to far with the flashbacks to the monkeys childhood being a particular example of this the character of maxine is also very weak when compared with some of the others being shallow self serving and with little depth however on the whole i cant really fault it on these two grounds it is a cult classic and is perhaps one of the most loved independent american films for a very good reasoni am dubious where to score this i know it definitely deserves an 8 but reading what ive written it is going to be910,black_comedy
this is one of the most unique but awkward film i have ever seen just about every part of this film was intriguing and cameron diaz screaming suck my dick just kept on adding to the awkwardness in a good way okay so craigjohn cusack and lotte schwartzcameron diaz are old fashioned couple except craig is a puppeteer he soon gets a job at a odd office on 7 and a 12 floor and soon find a portal that leads to seeing through the eyes of john malkovich for about 15 min and there is some odd love triangle thrown into this this is a very imaginative film with elements of alice in wonderland as well and just about everyone puts on a good performance at first you may find john cusack of being the prick but the old people especially dr lester is the bigger prick in my opinion anyways all in all its a creative film every actor and actresses put on a good performance the film is a like a breath of fresh air because of its weird clever and creativeness of the film8410,black_comedy
so i looked around the internet one google link to see if what i thought was going on was what was actually going on and couldnt find anything close i couldnt even find a synopsis but i think i might be on to something so in line with the ridiculousness of the movie i was thinking that living as john malkovich is a symbol for paradise or heaven for obvious reasons the two main characters are like adamn and eve they are innocent and pure and their love is innocent and pure they never fight about anything this is because of their detachment to the material world theyre totally unfashionable and seem like children when the puppeteer has to find a job he has begun his dive into the material world and more importantly towards the advancement of himself maxene is like a symbol for the pure ego sort of like satan who tempts adamn and eve to eat the apple of knowledge the apple being the idea of improving upon their already perfect paradise by living through john malkovich maxene keeps them from realizing that what they had before was the paradise and now after meeting her and using the portal they are constantly crying and hating each other there are parts in the movie where maxene is speaking to the two and they look awestruck by her they are infatuated with her ego her complete confidence and love of herself which turns into an infatuation with their own egos through being with her loosely the plot of paradise lost its like nothing anyone says or does can effect maxenes feeling of selfworth she has an invincible ego so she is not a human the two main characters are constantly being defeated by the outside world once theyve joined it and suffer as a result there are also a lot of parallels between the puppeteer and christ and between the old people and god and his angels,black_comedy
this movie starts off right off the bat strange you have no idea how someone could even come up with an idea for this john cusak plays a man named craig who is married to a nutty crazy haired cameron diaz who is named lotte lotte is a pet shop owner and she has about 20 pets living with her and craig in an apartment in nyc craig is a puppeteerwell a struggling puppeteer he is unable to find work therefore he sometimes sets up puppet shows on the side of the road one day after being nagged by his wife to get a job till puppeteering becomes more lucrative craig sees an ad in the paper for a man with skilled hands that leads craig to this filing company run by a strange man named lester one of the woman craig meets while working there is the sexy and mysterious maxine who craig instantly falls for while filing and working in his office craig finds a portalbehind a filing cabinet craig ventures through the portalwhich is a shlep through mud and muck into the head of john malkovichafter 15minutes in his head you get transported out and you land on the side of the new jersey turnpike craig tells maxine of his findings and they start up a business where strangers can spend 200 to venture through the portal into the head of john malkovich then lotte tries the portal and soon sees she enjoys being a man maxine realizes she likes lotte and when maxine goes to sleep with john lotte decides to go through the portal and be john lotte soon sees she loves maxine but so does craig therefore craig locks her up in the monkey cage lotte has a monkey that when through a trauma when it was young and craig decides to be malkovich every time maixine is going to be around malkovich craig then figures out how to control malkovich how to make him say and do whatever craig wants thats where some funny stuff goes downthough this movie is not directed by a director like david lynch no one could have done this better this has many points where this could be about real people about what they think and want out of life though it does seem like a strange idea it really is funny and very honest no character lies to you and you can easily associate yourself with one of them whether it is craig who is always pushed around maxine who is commander and takes over lotte who wants to be loved or lester who fears death or even john malkovich who has no control over his life its a great movie with a hilarious cameo by charlie sheen who later gets called charlie the masheen,black_comedy
it is wonderful when a movie comes out that sets new parameters this is so far fetched yet so ingratiating i loved it there are so many things that struck me that i cant begin to list them all to start with the crazy living conditions of john cusack and cameron diaz almost unrecognizable cusack is the morose puppeteer who puts all of his angst into his shows making them most unpalatable he is frequently struck by people on the street for doing things like heloise and abelard in a sexually suggestive manner then theres the office complex on the floor between floors which brings every sight gag imaginable i could go on and will leave the real reviews to others i just want to recommend this to anyone who wants to see a movie that on the surface sounds ridiculous but will have you hurting afterward malkovich gives his best performance playing a caricature of himself and showing himself to be a great sport,black_comedy
i agree with the absolute majority of the hundreds of commentators who have honored this movie that its appearance has in my words a similar importance for the future moviemaking as citizen kane had at the beginning of the talkies in short there are movies before and after citizen kane and now there are movies before and after since meanwhile 10 years have passed since bjm was broadcast this prediction has proved to be righti personally doubt that still in the 80ies it would have been possible to lance a box office hit based on a scenario solely consisting of metaphysics and of metaphysics in its purest form the question of the self but since then especially in the genre of horror movies we recognize more an more elements which go back to cybernetics semiotics nonaristotelian logic and related topic the generation of the movies before were restricted to einsteinian physics when stars wars came to and end when people got tired of traveling through the universe bjm came and people became more interested in traveling into the self by the way the self is a universe of its ownhowever what happens if you crawl into your own brain correctly speaking the basic problem with the identityeliminating corridor in the movie starts already when other people crawl into your brain do you realize that or not it seems that malkovich does not feel it this would mean that he disposes of an alter ego with is not in communication with his ego furthermore this alter ego is not recognizable for the subject as a common object if this would be true malkovich would be unable to recognize himself as a subject since not only can subjects recognize alter egos they are even characterized by iterating themselves thus creating subjects of subjects of subjects   so if you crawl into your own brain you correctly see  as depicted wonderfully in the movie  a large number of yours who are yourself and at the same time not yourself of course since the tunnel is an identityelimination device this idea by the way is from eta hoffmann mentioned in his diaries and henceforth quoted in many philosophical psychological and psychiatric studies unfortunately at that point the movie stops thematically and it would be highly interesting to see how a director would deal with the fact that one person is dissolved into several egos without drifting into the false concept of schizophrenia a logic in which this splitting of individuality is possible is a logic which transcends by far the aristotelian lightswitch logic and leads into a universe whose discovery will be infinitely more interesting than the timetravels through worm leaks or einsteinrosenbridges with which oldgeneration science fiction has entertained us during decades,black_comedy

being john malckovich is a movie that youll never see anywhere not saying that you wont find it in stores i mean that there is no other movie like it if youve seen it you know that its impossible is very weird and hilarious at times i never knew someone could come up with such a brilliant idea not only is the film hilarious and weird its also unique it mustve taken them a long time to write this movie the end of is rather surprising i will bring up one performance in particular im bringing up cathrine keeners performance if anyone knows how to play a bitch its cathrine keener it seems like every film that she is in she plays a bitch she plays one in this movie also john cusack is of course great as craig i also liked cameron diaz the usual as craigs wife has many memorable scenes including one scene where john malkovich himself goes into his mind i wont spoil that part for you director spike jonze has found a way to make a new kind of movie is a fantastic film with a weird cast and i think it was the best movie of 1999 not american beautythe plot craig is a puppeteer who gets a job at lester corp on the 7 and a half floor while working there he falls in love with maxine a snotty woman who works there he also discovers a portal that can lead you into john malkovichs mind and you can be john malkovich this portal soon turns craigs life upside down once his wife goes in,black_comedy
this movie is a great example of how being illogic can be mistaken for being original i mean if u ignore all the crazy stuff which makes the film interesting and get down to the plot youll see a very silly madeup lovestory about a bunch of people who dont care about each others privacy or anybodies theres nothing new about the idea of seeing the world through somebody elses eyes or taking over somebodies body i mean thats horror movie stuff if u want to name itthe looks and dialogs of the movie are definitely unusual but it still doesnt feel really original to me  thats mostly because the oddness really gets shoved in your face its supposed to be really weird and somewhat pointless and u can feel itall the topics that it could have touched are instead totally ignored or even made fun of i mean this could have been about voyeurism identity so many philosophical ideas instead it is plain about beeing john malcovic while at the same time pretty much ignoring who the real john malcovic actually is i mean hes the one i feel with most of the time his life being destructed in a horrible way the others being ignorant about the person theyre taking over were simply boring to meof course there is no denying that this is a movie which provides a different point of view and can make people wonder but im afraid its just too flat to really make somebody think,black_comedy
like a gogol story the fantastic nature of this film utterly grips you in rockyhorrorlike adoration for years to come this film defines eccentric in the most exciting and wonderful of ways from a strangely numbered  lowceiling office to a scene of puppetry masterly set to bartok the cast cusak is at his best malkovich is amazing diaz is memorable keener is stunning the sheer insanity of the story seems so completely enveloping that you too for a fee can be john malkovich and eventually find yourself on the side of the road if you think otherwise you must have lost your sense of wonder and lust for life or never had it in the first place as much as i would love a sequel i know that it would be impossible to follow it up with anything but a dud,black_comedy
very rare to see such a complex but tight script it hits all the points it intends to hit very complex yet easy to understand what kind of mind creates this from nothing i mean the floor the puppet thing the whole interwoven of so many themes yet the final film is fluid and functional the screenplay should have won more awards what a film and i am not even into these kinds of films but good work is good work regardless of your personal genre choice more films with creativity pleasesomething outside the box which bears nothing to other styles just like traffic did that disjointed thing this film does another thing most of the times scripts that are so heavy come from books so max credit,black_comedy
wonderful spectacular extraordinaryi normally dont write reviews but i had to contribute i just finished watching this film from itunes rentals ohmygoodness the entire film is so beautiful but a very different kind of beautiful one i cant compare anything too it is ironically beautiful like stranger than fiction it is desperate it is selfish just wonderfulthe plot is amazing a puppeteer discovers a way to be john malkovich he is unhappily married to a selfless bride yet he is attracted to a selfish sensual coworkerthe characters are each memorable and play so well the best performances in any movie ive seen i didnt recognize cameron diaz i didnt know she could act  she plays someone selfless yielding to others shes wonderful i didnt think during the movie that she was cameron diaz i thought she was lottie i still do she became someone else disassociated from herself which is extraordinary john cusack is also wonderful as ultimate desperation catherine keener i usually hate her but i loves and respected her as the ultimate selfish bitch john malkovich was given something insanely difficult he had to play himself as a part he was himself in an actors part yet he also had to play himself being manipulated by someone else imagine playing yourself but being controlled by your mom and he does a wonderful excellent job he captures the essence of the person playing himwatch it my favorite film so unique so different makes you realize how desperate and willing the human condition is,black_comedy
been john malkovich catches your attention since the moment you read its title it is a strange title for a movie and even more when you like the characters in the movie have heard the name of the actor but are not able to name any of his movies if you consider the title to be kind of original wait until you read the plot craig schwarz john cusack is a failed street puppeteer married to lotte cameron diaz yes its her  an animal loving womancraig realizes he cannot make a living out of his work and decides to look for a job as a filer the peculiarity of this office is it is located on the floor seven and a half here he meets his boss and maxine catherine keener the latter with whom he happens to fall in love but is not corresponded things start getting even weirder at least for us since the characters seem to take it lightly when craig discovers a secret door that leads into john malkovichs head lets you live through his point of view and then throws you out to a road outside of jersey craig is amazed by his experience and decides to set up an after work business where people pay 200 for maxine becomes his business partner but is also having plans of her won this is an amazing movie for me to spoil since it shows you scenarios you would have never thought about without leaving you confused at what is happeningthe movies main attraction is its originality since i cant think of a similar movie maybe eternal sunshine of the spotless mind by the same screen player plus its cast is really good and it gives you the chance to know and watch a little about an untypical form of art like puppetry,black_comedy
i adore this film and have watched over and over it features two of my favourite actors  johns cusack and malkovich the former gives a particularly deep and touching performance as the struggling puppeteer craig shwartz hes a beautiful man and he captures the audiences imagination and sympathy hes sensitive and dissatisfied with his life with his rather insensitive at least to his needs wife lotte played by cameron diaz who is not an actress ive never rated very highly though she is perfectly competent in this role it is a film which offers the audience so many possibilities on a number of levels from craigs becoming captivated by maxine a fellow employee at a most peculiar office craig gets a job in early into the film much to his dismay any adulterous ambitions he initially has are rendered hopeless by the fact that maxine has no interest in him as a suitor  is she mad anyhow craig discovers by chance a concealed hole in the wall of an office in work which if you progress down this hole you end up inhabiting the the being of john malkovich after he convinces an unsurprisingly sceptical maxine of this she sees the commercial possibilities charging potential customers for fifteen minutes of john malkovich although she herself never tests out the malkovich experience she soon along with the still desperate for her craig to make it a success craigs desire for maxine and his realisation that she does not share his feelings is made all the more acute when after meeting lotte for the first times declares to be smitten with her poor desperate craig what can he do the object of his desire is taken with his wife and to make a more complication proposition wants her when she is john she tells lotte who makes an attempt to embrace only as john craig is now very probably set never to gain maxine and also to lose his wifehe is desperate and as a result conspires to deceive maxine by inhabiting john when she believes lotte is the one pulling his strings as an exceptionally gifted puppeteer craig manages to utilise his ability to manipulate and does succeed in being malkovich and eventually tells maxine who is by now pregnant with johnlottes baby that it has been him all along and so craig is john and manages to turn john into a puppeteer a puppeteer being a puppeteer being a puppeteer spectacular surely though something so mind bendingly freaky cant go smoothly course not and eventually maxine releases it is lotte simply being lotte who she wants to be with in the background of all these events involving the four principal characters is dr lester craigs employer a 105 year old man who along with a select group of friends has no plans to die they want to be john malkovich too and have no intention of allowing craig to thwart their plans they make him agree to surrender his occupation of john by telling him they are holding his wife as security this is untrue she is with dr lester and co having managed to escape from the pet chimpanzees cage craig had imprisoned her in but she is there willingly and is even invited to join them in being malkovich it all goes at a terrific pace with a number of extraneous plot lines such as earlier john becoming himself or rather living his subconscious self during which he is in a smart restaurant in which everyone present is jm the only words uttered are malkovich and the only written words are malkovich which takes the form of a menu which lists every item as malkovich an amusing inclusion in this scene includes two female malkovichs one of whom sings malkovich repeatedly whilst seated on top of a piano the full horror of this has jm screaming his own name unsurprisingly is is thoroughly disturbed by this and once his time as himself is up he ends by threatening craig with legal action if the portal to his being is not blocked up forever its funny but you clearly feel his terror and incomprehension at the situation he knows when he is not acting independently but has hitherto not understood what was happening the film concludes happily for everyone other than craig he leaves malkovich the aged dr lester et al inhabit him and he appears not to be troubled by the situation as is shown in one of the last scenes where he greets an old charlie sheen making his second appearance in the film where he plays a charming cameo role as himself lotte and maxine even after having taken several potshots and they have johns child to keep them company she seemingly is a future vessel for further life greedy occupants brilliant the very sad aspect in all of this is craig being abandoned and alone an essentially good man he lost control of his feelings and ending up losing control of everything in a desperate attempt to be in control i think john cusacks portrayal of craig is one of his finest roles to date he really inhabits his character please excuse the pun and completely shinesin conclusion a quirky and fascinating film which has so much to say about human nature another nice touch was johns reference whilst talking to charlie sheen at the end to gary sinise an old member of their steppenwolf theatre company in chicago do watch this film it cant be spoiled by knowing how it develops there is so much to it,black_comedy
even after seeing this movie three times i am still not sure quite what to think of it being john malcovich is a thinking movie in every sense of the word and it brings to light many questions we may have never asked ourselves before watching it the most paramount of these questions is what is ethical the movie can get cheesy at times and youll probably grow to dislike the three main characters since they are kind of crazy it feels like by the end of the film the only person who gives a rat about john malcovich in this opera of tragedy is you of course you could look at the possibility of seeing the world through someone elses eyes from a more altruistic standpoint but that isnt how my eyes see itthere are some really good camera angles in the movie and the story itself is pretty interesting if a bit sciencefictionish the acting is good theres no question about that and john malcovich provides a great central character for the events of the story its just the whole idea of this doorway and the thought of being outside of yourself that makes this movie original that coupled with the powerful acting and visuals makes this a good moviei cant really sit here and try to describe being john malcovich without spoiling something or going on a rant about the questions it posed to me this is really just a film you have to see for yourself and think about because it goes into interesting territory and handles the subject matter maturely i think its worthy of an 810 rating,black_comedy
all the performances were greatcatherine keener as the total utter bitch maxine  i really wanted to hit her in the face  more than once during watching  but she had this other side a calm likable side  you wouldnt actually be able to  she didnt allout ask for itcameron diaz  so sweet and adorable  you felt hurt when craig locked her in at home its amazing how sensitively her relationship with maxine is portrayed  its completely normal and natural and the end when theyre happy just the two of them and their kid their child thats really wonderful craig you sort of feel sorry for and theres a great scene when him and lottie are staring at maxine shes so cool about it  then they jump at her face to kiss her  thats a hilarious moment  then when she leaves and theyre left on the sofa theyre both almost crestfallen  that pictures stuck in my mind the funniest line though has to be when john malkovich says with some menace ill see you in court  craig not worried the slightest goes dont forget ill see you seeing me in court  thats so funny and it makes you laugh at how absurd the whole situation is clever twist at the end with malkovich and charlie sheen both going into the room full of emilys photoswell worth watching and again and what a great idea for a floor 7 and a 12,black_comedy
this wonderful movie is for me below eternal sunshine of the spotless mind in the triplecrown of charlie kaufman screenplays of which adaptation takes an honourable third place in both adaptation and to a lesser extent ingenuity ends up taking precedence over emotion resulting in two hugely entertaining but ultimately rather cool works of cinematic art in eternal sunshine there is a palpable sense of loss of the loved one which in spite of the lessthanwarm casting of jim carrey raises the script of that movie to a higher levelof these three mastermovies is the one with the most endearing cast what a bunch bumbling orson bean dazzling christine keener crumpled cameron diaz furrowed john cusak and of course that much putupon all round good sport mr malkovich are all a joy i watched them again on dvd the other evening and it was like meeting old friendsthe other outstanding star of this fine film is the editor eric zumbrunnen who performed the same function on adaptation spike jonze was at the helm of both movies and needless to say did a superb job not least in balancing the technical needs of the film with the relationships between the characters,black_comedy
this is a difficult movie to describe so you have to bear with me john cusack plays an unsuccessful puppeteer in new york married to a thoroughly deglamorized cameron diaz he has the hots for his sole employee his tough and savvy officemate catherine keenerthen he discovers a kind of crawlspace in his office at the end of which is the sensorium of the actor john malkovich that is cusack can be in the mind of the real john malkovich but only for 15 minutes at a time after which he is spit out and flops on the ground next to the new jersey turnpike cusack decides that if he cant get anyone to pay to see his puppets he can at least charge the public 200 apiece for their 15 minutes in malkovichs mind this doesnt bother malkovich because he seems completely unaware of anyone elses being inside him but cusacks secretary keener has the hots for malkovich and through this portal is able to get his private phone number and agree to meet her at a restaurant they meet as arranged however when they sit across the table from one another and keener gazes at malkovich glowing with admiration and a filthier kind of lust malkovichs mind happens to be occupied by cameron diaz at that moment diaz has previously spent time taking a shower with malkovich and has found the idea of having a males plumbing appealing now she melts under the adoring gaze of keener in the restaurantdiaz returns from malkovich and tells her husband john cusack the failed puppeteer that she must be a transsexual because she has never had a woman stare at her with such love as keener showed towards malkovich in the restaurant now she wants an operation and shes going to talk to dr lester the astounded cusack shouts but dr lester is an allergist the next evening cusack and his wife are having dinner at home with keener they explain the situation to her then they both throw themselves on keener at the same time keener slaps cusack away and tells diaz that yes she finds diaz attractive  but only when diaz is in malkovichthen it gets really complicated there is a pursuit at one point through the repressed memories of malkovichs subconscious with malkovich seen peeing his pants on the school bus and sniffing panties malkovich  the real malkovich  must have a heck of a sense of humor his character admits to being stoned and we see him exercising his libido being snooty towards cab drivers and so forth the story ends up with diaz fathering her own child by keener while occupying malkovichif this were a novel it would be something like kafkas metamorphosis or nicholson bakers the fermata both attempt to follow the logic of an absurd premise it also packs a lot of humor and pathos into the story along the lines of pirandello and ionescu example of what i mean when john cusack returns from his first trip into malkovichs brain he no longer has the piece of wood he took with him in the face of keeners skepticism cusack demands to know where that piece of wood is did it disappear in the ether is it still somehow back there in malkovichs brain good question keener by the way is very sexy she has a throaty laugh nice limbs and she is strictly utilitarian only interested in money and sex until she falls for diaz she never heard of either john malkovitch or metaphysicsas a film it most closely resembles something that woody allen might have come up with if allen had been in the habit of ingesting psychedelic substances or something monty python might have dreamed up without any chemical help i must say i didnt get much out of brazil if you want a sense of the lengths to which this film is willing to go imagine a scene from swan lake being performed in front of a full audience involving the entire corps de ballet with a humansized wooden puppet in the middle of a circle of ballerinas and the puppet is unclothed made of raw wood with all his hinges and joints showing and the audience stands up and applauds in an era when american movies seem to have been formed by cookie cutters this kind of innovation is startlingshould you watch this well ill tell you how you can find out you go to a clinical psychologist see and you sit down and take the minnesota multiphasic personality inventory mmpi and then you ask the shrink what your profile looks like if he says anything like you peaked on scale eight you should definitely see this film because youll appreciate and enjoy it more than most otherwise  well its your mind,black_comedy
a rather ingenious concept that unfortunately goes a bit off the rails at the end and turns a masterpiece into a nearmiss everything up to the eight months later message is fantastic its funny its smart its dark its quirky john malkovichs performance as himself is inspired cusack is a bit stale but the two women more than make up for it with a pair of terrific performances the story is bizarre without being overthetop or silly the scene where malkovich goes into his own head is comic brilliance even moreso when he gets beaned by a beer can as soon as he comes out but once malkovich is taken over and becomes the puppeteer it just becomes far too strange even for me and the film suffers as a result still its one of the most unique films ever made and definitely worth a look at least,black_comedy
is an original movie this movie has great humor john cusack did a good job cameron diaz did a good job catherine keener did a good job and john malkovich did a good job this is one of the best movies of 1999 american beauty beats this movie this movie is so imaginative this movie got nominated for 3 oscars best director  spike jonze best original screenplay and best supporting actress i could not hardly realize that was cameron diaz john cusack was hard to recognize too this movie had great acting directing cinematography sets and script this is unlike any movie i have ever seen before i do not know why everybody hates this movie the movie that came out later that is similar to this is eternal sunshine of the spotless mind,black_comedy
this is the weirdest movie i have ever seen i really like john malkovich and that is why i rented the movie for that reason it was interesting but talk about weird you just have to see it to know what i mean there is really no explaining it the most interesting thing to me is to think about what kind of mind would write such a screenplay that person must be really interesting and creative well this site is requiring me to write ten lines and i cant write ten lines about this weird movie so im not sure i will be able to submit this comment or not i am trying to write ten line i am trying to write ten lines i am trying to write ten lines i am trying to write ten lines i am trying to write ten line i am trj4bk to write ten lines i am trying to write ten lines,black_comedy
watching this movie is like skateboarding on a mobius strip i am a sucker for suspension of disbelief so i actually spent several fruitless minutes trying to construct my own explanation of what john malkovich should see while inside john malkovich because i had decided the films depiction was inaccuratethe movie is a bit derivative several scenes are suggestive of seconds rosemarys baby and the episode of star trek the next generation in which counselor troi is mentally raped while the films flexible sexuality will amuse the sophisticates red state viewers are more likely to exit the experience with greater feelings of sexual paranoia and homophobia,black_comedy
this movie was so bad it forced me to right a review man i was tricked into watching this moviei guess after few months my mind needs to be reminded of never trusting the official critics but only to trust fellow movie fansi saw the above average rating and saw comedy and ignored reader reviewsi had to pay for my mistakes with tears as john malkovich is the worst movie i have ever seen forget actingpoor dramano comedy or the sorry state of mind of the writer of this horrific moviewhatever happened to good old comedies i hate two types of losers and cusacks character was bothfirst are people who want to be wannabes and second losers who wouldnt let a woman gonow some of you might think i didnt understand the moviemy point exactlyi am depressed watching this movie and as gods were already angry with me i watched it right after the great movie called taxi driveri wish there were more people like scorcessetarantinospielberg and lotr guy movies are suppose to be entertaining or thought provokingnothing else,black_comedy
one first has to get past the sinister plot by jonze to agitate the audience using a straight faced played story starring a famous reality story actor who starred in the killing fields and empire of the sun malkovich playing a character with the same name as himself in this surreal metaphysical essay on the forces that inspire murderan understanding that it is the compression of the workers of the 7 12 floor spines and haemic system caused by their constant bending of their bodies to stand that is causing the temporary to permament insanity helps to see this film more clearlyturning up the brightness or gamma of this picture 30 or so illuminates this picture containing images of darkness in many forms many night shots both craig and lottes faces at times encaved by their unkempt hair the drawing of curtains by contrast one of the few light scenes is set in the past of children in a school busthen a realisation that craig schwartz killed his wife that he had tried frequently to adulter and finally felt equal to on gaining employment after luring her to his office with his fantasy story and locking her at night heatedly on a thursday when a friday with the weekend next would obviously be more to his plot tomrrow that would be perfect in a hole behind filing cabinets in a wall taking from poes the tell tale heart wet weird thats nice oh oh umm oh sexy chills this macabre disturbed talehe spares maxine keeping her piously above his level of dirty crime during his serial killing spree with each victim added to his wall his epitomal goal of killing his wealthy boss and his friends is apparently eventually achieved in this happy ended filmturns into a pc lesbian partnership motherhood story with a happy ending the fantastical narcissistic view of craig being replaced by natural inevitably prevailing justicebtw ive chatted up the pretty young lady bjork that sings the end credits song when she was going out with goldie at a club night of his in london by jerome computer coder author and voter of 1000 films,black_comedy
is easily the weirdest movie i have ever seen it is completely bizarre the story is more original i think than anything since the beginning of cinema when well everything was original charlie kaufman has written three near classics called adaptation eternal sunshine of the spotless mind and and this is the best by far and although it doesnt have the best performance of the three which is held by nicolas cage for adaptation it has the second best in that of john malkovich who plays himself and a bunch of other himselfs the script is one of the best ever made into a film it is flawless with great characters and dialogue not to mention the plot the direction is also wonderful as are the visual effects the one big thing i didnt like about is john cusack who although much better than usual still cant give a good performance,black_comedy
craig was a street puppeteer in fact he had to rely on his wife because of his unpopular show so he decided to look for a job he successfully get a job in a company where located in weird seven and half floor one day he found a hidden door by chance in his office due to curiosity he crawled into the portal what happened next surprised him a lotif ones thought is controlled by another person that is definitely a tragedy if things go on like that life is boring and meaningless after i finished watching the imaginative movie i felt that i am so lucky to have my own thought for everythingexcellent screenplay and satisfying performance made the movie absorbing more importantly the comedy brought me not only laughs but food for thoughta meaningful fantasy movie 810,black_comedy
mild spoilers i must admit im not much of a comedy fan but this is one of the few comedies that i own the idea is just so out there that i have to love it its the film that introduced me to charlie kaufman and it inspired me to see other films hes written namely adaptation and human natureanother favorite one of my favorite lines is when john cusack looks over at his monkey pet and says something to the effect of youre lucky monkey you dont have to worry aboutconsciousness the film has a hint of sadness existentialism but it brings on the funny the performances by cusack catherine keener and cameron diaz are all great and john malkovich is excellentas always,black_comedy
most of john cusacks films i enjoy he is very good in comedies drama and action filmsi find him an incredibly funny actor his ability to wear a deadpan expression after delivering an incredibly funny line is amazing he comes across as very sincere it makes it easy to empathize with his charactersmy whole problem was with the plotthe premise of the movie was just too weird for me to get into to say it was surrealistic is to put it mildlyi realize that the idea of the movie was to take a a sort of absurdly improbably what if and fully explore that ideain that respect i think it does a good jobit explores the implications of this possibility with admirable depth and detail the actors play their characters believably  even if the plot itself is pretty unbelievablei enjoy science fiction horror and fantasy films i realize honestly that most of these films plots are completely or at least mostly implausible as well however in watching them i feel a sense of suspension of disbelief that i just did not experience with this moviei realize this film enjoys cult film status it is just not the cult for me i am afraidi watched this film at home when i was by myself maybe that was part of the problemi do sort of imagine this film could be more enjoyable if you watch it with a group of friends  especially at home not in a theater then you could exclaim about one bizarre scene or speculate about what will happen in the nexta group of close friends in a very relaxed informal rowdy atmosphere  who enjoy a taste for peculiar movies  could probably get pretty into it,black_comedy
charlie kaufman may be one of the most original writers in hollywood today pair him with the unconventional spike jonze who is equally as original and youve got one amazing filmis about well craig schwartz played by john cusack in probably his best role to date is a struggling puppeteer he loves his art form but unfortunately it is a dying art form lotte craigs wife acted to perfection by cameron diaz is obsessed with her animals one of these animals is a monkey whom lotte swears is traumatized by his childhood and needs psychotherapy the couple seems to genuinely love each even though they are down on their luck craig after some persuasion by his wife and to help with finances gets a job as a file clerk on the 712 floor of the mertonflemmer building it is here that he meets the beautiful maxine played by catherine keener in a role that earned her an oscar nomination from the academy he becomes a little obsessed with maxine and she loves the attention from him although she does not say this we can sense that after finding a portal to john malkovich where you can be him for 15 minutes craig and maxine hatch a plan to charge people 200 a pop to be john malkovich from here the story takes off into territory you will never see comingthis is one of the most original movies i have seen this is a movie that touches on themes that many people ponder but never bring to life what if i where someone else how far will i go to seek the approval of others it also touches on some philosophical themes such as am i who i think i am craig mentions some of these things after telling maxine about his first trip through malkovich everyone in this movie is amazing and this could be everyones best movie to date john cusack cameron diaz catherine keener and even john malkovich this is spike jonze first feature length film and a welcome one at that he earned a best director nomination from the academy i look forward to future projects he will be working on i highly recommend this movie but i will say it wont be for everyone,black_comedy
i had a great deal of expectation for this film and perhaps in a way that interfered with my enjoyment of it i had heard loads of positive things about it the plot sounded intriguing and original and i had read that it had a terry gilliam sort of sensibilityunfortunately few of these positive traits were actually borne out in the film it did kind of seem a bit like a terry gilliam film but it felt a lot more like a cheap gilliam knockoff than any sort of inspired filmmaking there was a lot of potential in many of the ideas of the film but most often they were executed without the finesse of a truly creative director instead of seeming original and innovative most moments in the film just seemed like halfassed attempts at creativitywhich is a shame and in a sense made the experience of watching it even more distressing because there were definitely inklings of a great film somewhere in there they just never really made it to the light of day,black_comedy
clearly this film is one of the oddest most interesting eclectic and finally one of the most original movies i have ever experiencedwhere do you begin with a review it took me four nights to experience it it has some flaws the biggest being the character played by john cusack  replace him and you might have the perfect diversion for a weekend of what the hell was that as is it is a movie that demands watchingi am still reeling as i write this review i dont know where to begin except to say if you are inclined to the unusual the bizarre and the completely unique you might want to check this film out i wont even try to delve into the story it is just too strange to relate you have to watch it you really do to get it and even then it will leave you wonderingacting of note is the amazing performance by john malkovich    as himself and many others quirky egoistic vulnerable and selfindulgent i think johns portrayal as himself and more is well it is very very different and very brave and challenging cameron diaz how could they make her look homely but they do and cameron is every bit the odd foil to malkovichs character then there is the woman who plays the crux maxine outstandingly performed by catherine keener who in her lynch pin character ties the film together i would be remiss in leaving out the aging orson bean and the cynical young and then old charlie sheen you simply have to see them in this film to appreciateunless you are an oddball a thinker and want to experience something entirely different i cant recommend this film but if you are so inclined i would highly recommend this delve into the possibilities of what if you could be john malkovichi give it 3 and 12 stars good stuff,black_comedy
put simply this is one of the most original films i have ever seen the beginning is outlandish yet remains believable somehow as the protagonist stops rather abruptly at floor 7 12dont forget to duck your head in this office and by the way dont rearrange the furniture or you might just uncover a little door which leads into the mind of actor john malkovichwhat starts off as a novelty quickly becomes a source of monetary gain giving people the opportunity to stay in the malkovich motel for a whole 15 minutesits bizarre original and fun yet somehow believable,black_comedy
certainly this film is an intriguing surrealistic piece it kicks off after a dramatical puppet play as a downtoearth independent lowbudget movie with an unrecognizable john cusack playing the role of an unemployed puppeteer craig schwartz who in turn is married with a naive pet shop clerk lotte schwartz impersonated by a totally transformed cameron diaz in what could be described as her most disgusting character to date although charming in her own waythen as craig follows the path to applying for a job in floor 7 of an office building the picture starts to draw a hilarious turn in a surrealistic almost monty python dialog that reaches its peak in the screening of the flats history later on things start to get creepier as the newlyemployed mr schwartz finds a secret door that leads to john malkovichs head with unexpected consequences involving the schwartzs and an attractive employee in the same floor named maxine catherine keener or a highly laughable and metalinguistic sequence when one dares to cross the door to its own perception no pun intendedall in all this is a very original and amazing movie which starts out pretty well but in the end it lacks a tad more of rhythm and gets a little repeating but in no way predictable and unparalleled in hollywood standards indeed,black_comedy
i think that charlie kaufman is going to be my favourite screenwriter i came to being jm after eternal sunshine of a spotless mind and again found with pleasure craziness and inventiveness in great abundancebeing jm won the saturn award for the best fantasy film from the academy of science fiction fantasy  horror films whereas eternal sunshine was nominated by the same for the best science fiction film very well because this means there is coherence and a kind of signature from an authorsaid that i loved the genius spread all around the film i must also say that id have been happier if such a brilliant idea of the vessel had been used to develop something more than just a comedyjohn malkovich you see maxine it isnt just playing with dollsmaxine youre right my darling its so much more its playing with peoplei mean from these very lines we can appreciate how differently and dramatically the film could evolve in a sense although as i said i enjoyed the movie i also had the impression of a big waste of talent in eternal sunshine such a talent was used to develop a wonderful love story and this is why i think that kaufman has really grown a lot after being jm,black_comedy
ever wanted to be someone else than you i believe that almost everyone would answer yes what it would be like to be someone famous you could say that is something that could be described as intelligent comedy its a story about a puppeteer graig john cusack who because as he says noone understands his art seeks a job as a filing assistant in a bizarre company located between floors 7 and 8 so floor 7 and a half it isthere he gets smitten on his female coworker maxine cathrine keener and while trying to pursue relationship with her his wife lotte cameron diaz too fells for this femme fetalsame time grag finds a secret tunnel which leads into the mind of john malkovich john malkovich who fells for maxine who wants to have relationship with lotte but only if she is inside john malkovichtheres lot more i just happened to find that particular triangle quite entertainingbut anyway you could say that this is an intelligent comedy which tells about existence of human soul there is drama too besides comedy and you can watch this movie and laugh or you can watch this as a drama it works both ways,black_comedy
any movie that can make me appreciate simultaneously the acting skills of charlie sheen john cusack cameron diaz and john malkovich is doing something pretty remarkable yet by the end theyd each rocketed up my list of favorite actors and i suddenly started looking for movies with orson bean mary kay place and catherine keener too its a tribute to the great script great directing and actors willing to take a chance on something that must have looked pretty strange on paper when it was just a screenplay we all owe some gratitude to john malkovich the actor not the character in this movie for his willingness to give the movie a shot i cant imagine it working with any other actor in the title characterrole,black_comedy
being john malcovichstarring catharine keener john cusack john malcovich cameron diaz orson bean mary kay place w earl brown and charlie sheenthis movie is just weird it deals with a puppeteer john cusack wanting to get a job and when he finds onewow he works on the 7 12 floor of a building which is only 5 and a half feet tall he meets a lady catharine keener that he falls in love with even though he is married cameron diaz to a nut animal freak he finds a door in his office that leads to john malchovich an actor and he becomes his conscience his wife tries it out and finds out that she is a lesbian by the way you can only go in for 15 minutes catharine keener then goes on a date with john malchovich when cameron diaz is in him so shes going out with him and her as his conscience john cusack finds out how to control john malchovich and it works he stays in him for about eight months bizarre huh catharine keener is also a lesbian in the end she gets pregnant by malchovich while diaz is in him so its their lesbian love child the question is why is their a door to malchovich its because these old people are trying to live forever by going from body to body taking over minds in my opinion the ending is brilliant it ends where cusack took the next body available and got trapped forever in her conscience with no control its a weird but fun movie the most interesting scene is when malchovich goes into his own portal and sees the world where everybody has his face but women still have boobs and they wear their own clothes the only word they can say is malchovich its a movie i dont like but i respect greatly charlie sheen briefly plays charlie malchovichs actor friend who is in a couple of scenes the scene hes in at the end shows him in eight years balding this movie is not for all but all should respect it my rating 4 out of 5,black_comedy
something really weird just happened to me i was watching this film for the first time the first time johns malkovich head is entered and he is in the cab when he speaks i heard his voice and randomly said to my bro that sounds like michael stipe the singer of rem ok i knew nothing about this movie then at the end watching the credits it says producer michael stipe now how weird is that its the same guy i was talking about and i dont even like rem anyone know if he was doing a random voice over this is a bit confusing so i am thinking surely michael stipe and john malkovich dont look alike and sound alike i thought it was a good film but probably wont be watching it again,black_comedy
there are some good performances by john cusack and cameron diaz the heart of the matter for me though is the moment when john malkovitch becomes john malkovitch its one of the best comedic sequences in motion pictures i wont spoil it for you beyond that but its worth pointing out that john malkovitch is a splendid actor who carries this movie on his back hes only in it for about 13 of the time but during that time i get a reminder of what a great talent really is even if he is full of himself with his periwinkle bathmat lol the director loses focus during an extended session where we see proof that the puppeteer has become john theres an interview with sean penn which does nothing to advance the storythe character maxine is an intimidating and disheartening reminder of how beautiful single women can sometimes behave,black_comedy
this is one of those movies that really affects a certain type of person if you like surrealism then youre one of them if you dont like to think or if you want a movie as background entertainment then i wouldnt bother the plot is so utterly ludicrous that you just have to suspend disbelief for long enough to enjoy the experience definitely worth watching several times as there are many subtle jokes and philosophical points throughout the script the acting is superb of course john malkovich himself does a fantastic job despite being required to act as a parody of himself cameron diaz is barely recognisable as the wacky wife and plays the confused ignored role exceptionally well,black_comedy
this movie is one of the few ones that i was surprised bylately it is very interesting as the movie is created without particular attention to details in fact what i think that does this film a good and surprising one is how it shows us that the essence is the most important in life i disagree to the ones that say this movie hasnt got any sense because i find many meanings to it i think it is brilliant how the movie contains so many ideas perfectly combined like homosexuality mind games wasted talent etc it is a movie which should be awarded as it deserves i enjoyed it and i would recommend it to anyone who can understand it and learn something from it,black_comedy
after reading 15 other reviews some good and some bad i seem to be the only one who was somewhat scared by this movie i finished the movie not knowing wheter to love or hate what i had seen the only clear emotion i had was one of uneasiness my sleep after the movie was disturbed by some of the first nightmares ive had in years the entire premise of the movie and especially the final scenes are enough to weird you out if not outright frighten you the acting was great the directing was good as far as i can tell and the writing was creative if nothing else the movie is too weird to explain too abstract to interpret if there really was something to interpret in it and too offputting to watch at night,black_comedy
defiantly an interesting movie i wasnt too sure how to take it and i didnt quite understand it but i liked the idea its true that all the time people want parts of other peoples lives in fulfill the parts of there own that they cannot live up to and addresses that in a very very unique way it was a little dry in parts and i wasnt quite sure why some of the relationships ended up interacting in certain ways however it did have some presently surprising areas i laugh so hard at the fact that they ended up on the new jersey turnpike and the whole puppet aspect that it has is quite unique and well well executedthis movie is well worth watching but dont expect to understand it it didnt rate high on my quest for the best movies of all time im afraid the competition is just too strong,black_comedy
offbeat is hardly the word for this truly unique production an outofplace marionette maker and master is forced to take other work in a weird decidedly surrealistic office and discovers a portal into the mind of the actor john malkovich as he shares this discovery with others in his life a whole series of events mushrooms which asks myriad questions of identity gender relationships and age a real john malkovich and pal charlie sheen play themselves although john is not necessarily living his real life a menagerie of other characters make those in the world according to garp look mundanely normal there are plenty of loose ends but at times this satirical genredefying film borders on greatness its definitely a worthwhile watch for those who ponder,black_comedy
it was so unbelievable that i could sit through 120 minutes of pure junk i expected much more out of this movie because i enjoy john malkovichs body of work and talent during his distinguished careeri first noticed malkovich in con air when he portrayed cyrus the virus grissom really well i have since followed his career in amazement i can not believe how the writers could give the actors a poor script to work with from beginning to end i was lost in a maze of dialogue and bad development as well as execution on everyones part that i wanted to leave after 30 minutes however something told me to stick with because one never knows what will happen later on i was disappointed to learn that there was nothing worthwhile to see and i wasted my time on an awful movie furthermore to make matters worse the rest of the cast couldnt even save the moviei do not recommend this film to anyone nor would i allowed to be paid to watch it again,black_comedy
i only watched about 23 of the movie  at which point i shut it off with major disappointment i had heard it was such a great movie and i love john cusack but i could not finish watching it i could not relate to anything i saw in the movie and it only seemed dark and depressing to me  i could not find the humor at all i have watched a few movies that i have found tolerable just to watch john cusack who i think is a very good expressive actor  but i was disappointed in this choice of rolls which i understand he thinks was great i guess that art is only as good as the viewer thinks it is  in my opinion this was garbage,black_comedy
this cozy lowbudget slapstick production where the characters humorously struggle with confusions of identity and sexuality while being inside actorintherealworld john malkovich showcases the screenwriter charlie kaufmans twisted talent while spike jonze is surprisingly invisible as a director some settings to generate an unusual atmosphere work ie the seventh and half floor with a low ceiling while the others dont ie the schwartzs unusual pets such as a chimpanzee malkovich should have differentiated his acting more when craig schwartz john cusack is inside and controls him the malkovichinsidemalkovich sequence which is somehow reminiscent of an endlessly looped picture on a monitor when a camera is aimed at the monitor is not unpredictable enough and seems to be added only to satisfy some demanding audience who would question this if it was not there,black_comedy
i didnt really enjoy this film but then i didnt really hate it either  i have an exam in experimental cinema this afternoon and i thought this film may be of help and im glad ive seen it for all that its hyped up anywaythe lay out and lighting and general feel to the beginning of this film was untidy  i didnt like the way it reminded me of eraserhead where nothing makes sense but nothing is qustioned either  in fact there is very little communication throughout the whole film  personally i like developed charactersbut then again i dont particulary like surrealist films which at the end of the day is what it is  the comedy is just a subgenre if you likethe point of surrealism is that there is no point  youre not meant to dig to deep into it because there is no calculated meaning  un chien andelou is a perfect example of this  i cant do that though i like meaning in films i like things that i can understand so go figurehowever before this film i hated john malkovich because i had only seen him playing the retard lenny in of mice and men and the prospect of watching a film about him wasnt very tempting but now i find him quite attractive so i give john malkovich a 45 but 25,black_comedy
i have to admit ive seen some extremely weird movies but never have i walked away from a movie with this kind of ambivalencei cant decide exactly what the point of this movie was or how someone could possibly put it together but i liked it at the same time i walked away from this movie feeling like there may be something wrong with me just from having watched it i dont understand why john malkovich was the character of choice or why there was a seventh and a half floorbut it was very unique and possibly the most original movie of the 20th century cameron diaz does a great job of playing her character and the fact that her character is so complex is really great which also goes for john cusack the idea of people being able to delve into other peoples minds is insane imagining what you could do and the kind of power you would have i wasnt exactly sure of what to make of it at first but the end reveals all i think its the kind of movie you have to watch more than once to really decide how you feel about it but its still a must see,black_comedy
im in two minds about this film pun intendedafter the first ten minutes i wanted to switch it off because i couldnt get into it  puppets  who cares about puppets  i hate puppetsand animals toohowever i stuck with it and im kind of glad i didwhywell apart from catherine keener who i thought was knockout in every way the concept was really interesting and as soon as john malkovich appeared on the screen in the flesh it became rivetingits so good to see a major star being prepared to make fun of himself and his status charlie sheen too  loved the combover and i really wanted to know how the story would be resolvedhowever im not sure i liked the way it developed it became an uneasy mix of satire and science fiction and i think one of those genres would have been better than twoi also like it when i can identify a theme in an art movie  this one was presumably about identity and knowing who you are  but the message got lost in the medium  but then didnt some producer like sam goldwyn say that if you want to send a message use western unionso like i say im in two minds about it  you need to see it yourself if you want to make up your minds,black_comedy
this movie is highly imaginative and sometimes surreal it is good in spots and horrible in others there is something called suspension of disbelief and this movie really pushes itas a few other commentators pointed out the first 12 of the movie is very funny and enjoyable however there is a section about half an hour long where john cusack is absent this ruined the film he was the strongest character and suddenly were stuck with john malkovich john has undergone a major character change which i hated and could not accept its so ridiculous and so awkward that the movie stops being funny and is suddenly a horrifying mess there is a lot of plot holes and a lot unanswered at the end it was almost worth it but there is a lot that doesnt really make sense the ending is a huge downer because the main character gets left with nothing a reluctant 610 because i really wanted to like it,black_comedy
i saw this movie in the theater after hearing lots of hype i saw itwith a good friend of mine who is very intelligent i sat with her whileshe laughed and i just scratched my head wondering whythere is no doubt that this is a very creative story nothing like iveever seen and frankly i wanted to like this movie but did notto me this movie is like other movies ive seen in the past othertitles escape me at this moment that are not really funny saddramatic or meaningful in anyway just weird enough to be thoughtprovoking and people who didnt really get it are highly likely to telleveryone how much they loved it but never have an explanation as towhy and i assume its because they dont want other people to thinkthey or dumb its like hearing a joke that you didnt get thepunchline but laughing anyhow i didnt get the punchline for th,black_comedy
many friends of mine suggested to watch it unfortunately i succeeded to do it very late and i am sorry because it is a very good movie it is something new good idea nice story completely different from usual targets it could be seen as a poem it is quite unreal but it let us feel a nice dream the story is a piece of geniality and cinema needed it i dont want to describe scenes or to say the plot i want just to offer the possibility to anyone who didnt watch it to do it as soon as possible malkovich is one of my favourite actor and here is brilliant also because he take joke of himself good interpretation from john cusack while a surprise could be cameron diaz but who watched last supper can understand that sometimes rarely she can take part of a well done movie sorry for my english ill be better in next,black_comedy
being john malkovic is certainly not a typical film on the contrary the ingeniuity of its plot is definitely its most strong point a loser puppeteer who discovers a portal who makes people get into john malkovics brain is persuaded by his evil colleague maxine with whom he has fallen in oneway love with to turn it into a profitable business however things get much more complicated when his hippy and animalloving wife enters the portal and finds out that she has the hots for maxine too and this is just the beginning of the story with more twists to follow later however ingenious the scenario might be it gets at some point a bit overstretched the result is that when the movie ends you are a bit overwhelmed with what you have just watched and you are left with mixed emotions this does not mean that the movie is not good the performance of all the actors is great with malkovic being an excellent malkovic whereas the movie certainly does not let you get bored as the plot develops at a fast pace the movie gets a 710 overall,black_comedy
from the creators of adaptation and confessions of a dangerous mind director spike jonze and writer charlie kaufman is a splendid and incredibly original film which on top of the unique script boasts an allstar cast john cusak cameron diaz catherine keener and john malkovichthe plot is unique and complex and centers around the life of craig schwartz john cusak an unemployed and unsuccessful puppeteer his simple modest life takes an abrupt and confusing turn when he accepts a job as a file clerk on the 7th and a half floor of an office building in nyc here he becomes obsessed with a coworker maxine catherine keener and starts to fantasize of a romance with her despite his marriage to wife lotte cameron diazthings become even more strange and complicated when craig discovers a portal in his office which when entered takes you into the head of famous actor john malkovich playing himself from here on in the the lives of craig lotte and maxine become entwined complicated and very strange as they attempt to work out the best possible solution for their own problems needs and desires is one of the most brilliant original and unique films of the last decade if not of all time kaufmans script combined with jonzes directing is the perfect match and compliments each others unique way of story telling pushing all the boundaries of fictional story telling and creating an utterly compelling and clever film an excellent film  810,black_comedy
a struggling puppeteer craig cusack and his animalobsessed wife diaz become mesmerized by the discovery of a portal into the mind and body of john malkovich which is found in the office at craigs new job craziness and weird situations ensue possible spoilers herein but if i do they wont be too revealingthis movie is another great example of how spike jonze and charlie kaufman can pump out some truly original films not typical of todays regurgitationstyle filmmaking i decided to watch this film after thoroughly enjoying adaptation cusack and diaz show off their acting skills in this movie which was a surprise for me because i typically dont like the movies they both choose to be in john malkovich was cast perfectly as the host to which a portal to his mind exists hes a weird guy so it fits perfectly the idea that there is a portal out there in which you can experience being someone else is truly awesome and makes a great premise for a movie i also like how the portal dumps its occupants on the side of the road on the new jersey turnpike when the ride is over kaufman seems to have a knack for making quirky but wholly original films and is why i cant wait for their next project this movie has it all comedy romance reality fantasy and fun the jokes in this movie are executed beautifully and made me laugh out loud several times i love almost everything about this movie the actors the screenplay the comedy and fantasy and the ending ahhhh catherine keener is also great in this film as maxine and man is she sexy it was no surprise when both craig and his wife wanted to get with her and pined over her i loved her character in the movie even if she was an evil floozymy only qualm with the movie was trying to figure out why all of those old people would want to go into malkovich at once and share his mind and body personally id rather just die i think the movie couldve done with them but thats just me other than that its perfect 910,black_comedy
is a very well done movie  so why didnt i like it let me start by saying that i do like the first third of the movie  the establishment of the hidden surreal environment tucked away right in the middle of manhattan was particularly well done and appealing why didnt i like it  im going to have to get extremely subjective here so bear with me  i think the main reason that the movie as a whole didnt work for me is a lack of identification with the characters  if youve never had a desire to be someone else then you probably wont identify with the motivations of the cameron diaz character  quite often you can become interested in a character even without such identification  that didnt happen either  as a painfully normal and content male i found it incredibly hard to be interested in the hysterical desires of an unattractive woman who is doubting her choice of partner her sexuality and even her gender  such musings dont offend me they simply dont interest me  as for the other characters they are almost uniformly unattractive  they are purposely unattractive  if i cant sympathize with the characters and have no superficial interest in any of them then that makes for an unsatisfactory viewing experience  i can tell you objectively that this is a good movie  subjectively if youre a heterosexual guy who is comfortable in his own skin with no gender issues or doubts about your sexuality then you stand a good chance of being disappointed by this movie  end note enjoyment of this movie in no way implies that you dont fit the personal profile mentioned,black_comedy
wow it took me quite a while to realize the true genious of this film which when seen in its right light really comes of as a masterpice of modern cinema this picture bares no resemblance with anything you have seen before and the very essence of the plot is uniqe to the very end dispite being a very philosophical issuethat man probably has been thinking ofabout since the dawn of time really how would you like to be some one else whilst on the subject how would you like to be the award winning actor john malkovichwith astounding preformances from a great set of actors a script to die for directing that will be remembered as nothing but excellent and a set of events occuring that is on the edge of pyhtonesque in its amazing humor and wittyness really has an aura of perfection like few movies to be compared with citizen kane brazil metropolis and other works of genious i love this film  out of ,black_comedy
this is a very original movie and its always good when you see something original coming out of hollywood the film also manages to make cameron diaz look unattractive  amazing  john cusack must be one of the most underrated actors in hollywood and he puts in another fine performance as the puppeteer when he starts a regular job he finds a portal into john malkovich now this will not be everybodys cup of tea but if you like offbeat films this is for you,black_comedy
i really didnt know what to say when those final credits abruptly started rolling amongst the confounding final images of the enigma that is how surreal can one single film be the sheer amount of concepts imagery lines structuresits clearly a revolutionary picture as far as im concerned no doubt about that very rarely do i finish watching a picture with such a disturbed bewildered reaction as i had when my viewing of this ended now ive become newly reinterested in the phenomenal genius of the two major behindthescenes men who put this together spike jonze and charlie kaufman how unbelievably wild offthewall and just plain out there can two guys be these guys are absolute lunatics i couldnt believe my eyes not to mention the terrific casting and the amazinglycrafted storyline that i have yet to fully comprehend not surprisingly  and of course a signature scene that i feel will remain as one of the few most spectacularly messedup sequences in motion picture history i have ever seen that would be the malkoviches in the restaurant scene wow what a memorable gem need i say more is there really anything else one can say about this its all been said before i totally commend and give major major props to all involved in such a great film that truly stands out as one of the most groundbreaking and innovative films of the 20th centurys closing spike jonze  also a worldrenowned music video guru  is definitely a fascinating young talent to watch,black_comedy
belongs to a class by itself it is what one can call weird but wonderfully enjoyable the story centres around a puppeteerhis wife and their obsession with the concept the plot and the characters of this film are far from ordinary john cusak is convincing as the highly eccentric and almost partly insane puppettier cameron diaz plays his wife she isnt too bad but doesnt exactly shine catherine keener gives an interesting performance and john malkovich is supposed to play himself but amazingly he doesnt the cumulative effect will leave you amused and wondering if you are still sane this one is not for everyone and it has its own brand of humor at the end an eccentric but enjoyable film that you dont want to miss,black_comedy
my rating 14 out of was a movie i watched this summer i had heard good things about it so i was excited when i was done my thoughts were it was good but disappointing the reason i think malkovich is disappointing is in its script charlie kaufman has come up with a brilliant original idea but i didnt find the dialogue anything special it was only a tiny cut above average the idea was great and the film has some brilliant scenes for example the restaurant full of malkovichs was the best scene of the movie its just that i felt not enough effort was put into the dialogue was actually more entertaining than funnybut spike jonze seemed to have an idea of what hes doing he gets good performances from the cast john cusack is quite good here and im not a huge fan of him however i am a huge fan of cameron diaz and she does very good work here catherine keener was good but definitely not worth an oscar nomination however the standout is john malkovich its really difficult for an actor to play himselves and malkovich does a great jobi liked also worth mentioning was the ending which i thought was really sad but the movie becomes a bit uneven from the dialogue if the dialogue was improved malkovich would have gotten at least a  12,black_comedy
i had my doubts about this movie as i kept delaying seeing it but i finally decided to give it a try and i must say i dont regret it it wont be in the list of my all time favorite but nevertheless is quite a memorable flickmostly plotwisein not kind of movie that you see everyday it is actually in a genre of its own there are many interesting concepts in this movieenough for a few more films i guessbut the main one is the idea of what is like to be somebody else another person even for a short time15 minutes in this case this person is the great john malkovich a portal located on the 712 floor leads to the head of the actor the guy who discovers the portal is a puppeteer john cusack how about that for a start it gets even better the whole cast in this movie was just perfect even charlie sheens cameo was cool everything was very original and unconventionalfor all those of you looking for something more and new in a movie than just the usual revenge comedy love heroes etc type of stories i recommend this one you wont be disappointed 9 stars for inventiveness and acting over all 8 out of 10,black_comedy
this movie was minds rollercoaster cruel idea was so soooo insane that it was brilliant i enjoy really to watch that film after many films i dont have a feeling that i have to watch it again but after this i feel so and it is a lot this mindtwister have to live again,black_comedy
wow just finished watching this movie and i mean wow words like original wellacted wellwritten thrilling engrossing and hilariously bizarre cant even begin to describe this movie i had no idea what to expect from this movie but all i know is by the end i was completely blown away its indescribable how huge of a mind trip this movie is its one of those movies you simply must see to understand what the hell im talking about yes the movie is that good yes the movie is that brillianti cant give this movie anything less than a 1010 i would say more but words simply cant do this movie justice just see it youll know what im talking about,black_comedy
this and american beauty are easily the best films of 99 this film is so goddam original i think that its easily on my list of the weirdest films of all time jonzes direction is top notch and kaufmans writing is excellent both deserved oscars and both were robbed by american beauty which was an excellent film but was not too well directed so i would have at least given jonze the directorial oscar and probably kaufman the screenplay too but ab the best film award this is an excellent black comedyfantasy,black_comedy
this is definitely one of the more original movies of the past ten years it starts off very strong but it seems to be that they just werent really sure how or when to end it  i think the comedic possibilities of people visiting malkovich could have been explored more and made this a much funnier movie,black_comedy
like other screenplays by charlie kaufman eg adaptation this movie has an excellent premise the intriguing idea alone of which is enough to hold the viewer captive for about 23rds of the moviethough some other viewers seem to think the overthetop plot is too farfetched and nonsensical to be believable enough to hold ongoing interest i disagree i have seen the movie 3 times and indeed the details all make sense however  i qualify this praise by saying the accelerating weave of turmoil that takes place about 23rds the way through the movie does begin to get a little tedious  one wishes kaufman would have stuck to the simplistic beauty of the original idea without getting so hallucinogenic 1 or 2 subplots is enough not 5 or 6 and the cinematic reference to rosemarys baby is cute but totally unnecessarythat being said i still gave the movie a 9 rating for the originality and interest of the idea alone and the excellent casting and production techniques this movie far surpasses kaufmans adaptation which simply falls apart because of its overreliance on the cleverness factor,black_comedy
what a weird trip this movie is and what a captivating trip too i had no idea of the plot when i started watching being john malchovich so it was a complete suprise allthough the movie doesnt really have an accurate plot it has dark humor fantasy horror comedy document romance so many different flavours that it just makes you laugh with exitement and confusion in a pleasant kind of way i truly recommend this movie to any one who likes to think it will leave you a bit mixed up with some questions but in a pleasant kind of way,black_comedy
as im pretty much a hardcore malkovich fan i couldnt wait to see this movie and i wasnt dissapointed a very unique and clever film and utterly hilarious malkovich was excellent as was catherine keener portraying sexy vamp maxine cusack and diaz were almost recognisible yet displays some of the best performances of their careers all in all i found to be brilliant a movie everyone should experience for himself,black_comedy
warning slight spoilers just oneliner descriptions of scenes in the movie that might be funnier if you havent read this but no revelation of any major elementswhile i wouldnt call this film a metaphysical analysis of identity it does raise a few interesting questions about the nature of individual humans as mortals  that is coincidental however to the humor that abounds in a world where old people can live forever by hopping from brain to brain of young people  there are a great number of memorable scenes including the always hilarious falls into the ditch cameron diaz locked in her monkeys cage and malkovichs monumental switch from actor to puppeteer are some of them  the dialogue is also funny  one criticism is that once a viewer gets over the initial weirdness of the idea the plot sort of falls out as a result  many loops are thrown in terms of explanation of the original idea but not so much as changes in the plot itself  not as philosophical as one might hope but it takes a funny idea and makes it better 710,black_comedy
its been a long time since i havent seen such an unconventional movie done with so much talent actually since brazil delicatessen or maybe santa sangrethis one is near to perfect the fantasy plot is delicious the characters very tasty the acting and direction are of sheer excellence i laughed i was moved and i was deeply immersed in the storytelling definitely my kind of humor definitely the kind of movies id love to watch more oftenwouldnt it be for some little technical flaws it would be a total classic an absolute masterpiecei hope spike jonze will keep on making movies,black_comedy
this was one of the weirdest movies i have ever seen  i have no idea how anyone could have come up with the idea for this movie but it is definitely something that has not been done before  i would recommend it just for the sheer experience of seeing such a crazy movie,black_comedy
hmm what can i say about this one i really wonder why this movie rates so high sure the idea is very intriguing and original but they could have done so much more with it the puppeteer was a great character but there should have been more intriguing characters around him the two women werent that at all and their acting was also quite poor the story could have been built up much more interesting for starters the whole idea of being able to enter someones mind which the puppeteer finds out at some point should not have been given away so easily and quickly to others he tells it too soon and the women believe it and find it out too soon and the whole reaction is too calm what would you think if youd hear you could actually go inside someones brain their reaction was more like oh aha well i see okay then this movie cannot receive a high rating just because of an intriguing concept it must also be worked out well which is not the case here because most parts of the movie are well quite boring actuallyrating from the dutch judge 6 out of 10,black_comedy
is commerical and music video director spike jonzes first film he next made adaptation which i felt was much better then this movie but enough of that ill say it straight out is weird very weird it has random moments in it that you wont get for a few seconds but its funny i cant really blame jonze for this mostly kaufman for conceiving the way of executing his concept  being in the mind of someone famous this movie is sad has great acting flawed characters etc john cusack does a good job as well as cameron diaz but the 2 stars of this film are catherine keener oscar nominated role as well as john malkovich who didnt get a nomination the characters in this movie are unsually inconsiderate they will destroy each other for stupid reasons the only person you feel bad for is john malkovich because he has to go through all of this s i felt this movie deserved best director and best screenplay but it didnt win overall impressive comedy sometimes too wacky id recommend seeing adaptation over this but do as you please 910,black_comedy
was i lost this was a very confusing yet entertaining movie malkovich was brillant in this irrevent satire of himself charles kaufman is a genious you have to be really stupid to understand this movie cause it appeals to the basic of human wants,black_comedy
this film is full of holes and sometimes what the characters do are quite hard to believe but it doesnt matter cause this is supposed to be a surrealistic film it talks about how our skin affect different thingsfor example the puppeteer was miserable and dispised upon when he was in his own skin but it was ironic the way he archieved huge success only when he possessed john malkovichs bodyanother example is how maxine was only interested in lotte only when shes john malkovichso is it that john malkovich is an avatar from god so that there are things only he couldve succeed at i dont think so and the film doesnt think so when maxine was married to lotte in the final actperhaps craig couldve done everything on his own if he only he has tried harderthe film also talks about obssession and honesty in different ways id recommend this to everyoneid give this a 710 points down because the charactors act strangely sometimes for one who would choose climb into a dark spooky tunnel like that just because someone told you that its a portal to someones brain the funny thing is everyone in the film was so easily conviced ,black_comedy
 spoilers ahead i think theres a lot of latitude in how one can take this movie  i have a friend who felt ripped off by the lesbian plot angle  i pointed out to him that the angle in which cusacks character gets to use malkovichs prestige to push puppetry up to and over the edge was sheer brilliance and he had to admit that that did rather salvage the central theme from a purely puerile development  then he pointed out the gulf between the otherworldly wackiness of the first half of the movie and the later abandonment of that particular brand of surreality for the relatively serious feel of the last half  that was an inconsistency in the film that i guess i have to cop toat any rate i still thought it was worth watching a very exciting fun wellwritten wellacted entertaining movie and not a little thoughtprovoking  the most amazing thing about the movie is that it takes a old worn out theme metempsychosis transmigration of souls and breaths real new life into itcheck it out,black_comedy
as much merit as a completely original film has they wasted it on such a pathetic plot line as this one  besides the wife the animal lover contemplating having a sex change because she wants to have homosexual relations with the woman her husband also randomly falls in love with and the idea of manipulating john malcovich to fulfil their own kwirky sexual desires i cant think of anything worse to base this movie on  well i probably could but point being that the first half of this movie was better than the second which was simply a waste of time and efforts  so my recommendation to you is dont watch this movie unless the things ive mentioned here appeal to you in some way,black_comedy
i rather liked this movie  it seems to have split its jury between those who love it and those who hate it  this is probably down to its weirdness getting over the strange plot it is a thoroughly absorbing and entertaining film  all the main characters are truly horrible  even the cameron diaz mouseofawife character unusual part for her is a tough bitch underneath the weak sugar surface  in fact the chimpanzee was probably the only character i genuinely liked which is fine by the way because although you dont like the characters they are quirky and interesting enough that you want to see what happens to themtakes a while to warm up  jane slept through most of the first half hour which made the plot wicked difficult to explain  i recommend seeing it awake the whole way through,black_comedy
this film is a wonder an absurd comedy with gags you only find when having smoked barely illegal stuff  and at the same time a work of art that asks profound philosophical questions about the state of individuality and being a person what doesnt quit to amaze me is the courage with which john malkovich let jonze the director and kaufman the writer use himself and his proper name i wonder how many hollywood stars would have done this the whole cast is brilliant  if you can make them out under their wigs and beards and the dirt they sometimes are decorated with a film to watch more than once,black_comedy
yes its twisted of course its bizarre but lets not forget that its also plain brilliant if its at all possible for brilliance to be plain it is simply one of the most unique movies ever made and it couldnt have come along at a better time the story is about a struggling puppeteer with an animalcrazed wife john cusack and cameron diaz respectively who finds a portal in his office leading to the mind of john malkovich he discovers that by crawling through it he can actually be john malkovich for fifteen minutes after which he is spat out on the new jersey turnpike and if you think thats weird what happens next will blow your mind he and the woman he works with  catherine keener in her oscarnominated performance  decide to sell tickets to the portal for 200 a pop things go terribly wrong however when john malkovich uncovers the scheme transforming what was at first a wildly funny fantasy into one of the most thoughtprovoking meditations on existentialism ever brought to the screen because aside from being a comedy has equally tragic parts the finest example of this concept spoilers ahead is the ending as cusacks character is trapped in the subconscious of the daughter of the woman he loved he stares at her and tries to force himself to look away forever doomed to watch the world through someone elses eyes its not just the story and the ending that are great though every aspect of the film is fantastic the screenplay and the direction are perfect both of which received academy award nominations and the movie itself is truly intriguing  and strangely rewatchable while not for everyone is a spectacular piece of work and one of the best films of the ninetiesgrade a,black_comedy
enjoyed the movie although it is a bit different  thought the opening puppetering scene was top notch   diaz was good gained some respect in acting ability idea was original  someone took a chance on this one you should check this film out if you have some time to spare 710,black_comedy
being john malkovichwhat a movie best orginial screenplay awesome job another cool original screenplay movie is donnie darkowhat i still cant understand is where i come from this movie is under a comedy i feel it is a dramanice movie a must see out of ,black_comedy
this movie drove me to insanity i will give it a good rating only because it did what a good movie is supposed to do effect the viewer and oh man did this movie effect me it drove me nuts watching it,black_comedy
coincidentally this was the first movie i ever watched on dvdthis movie is absolutely amazing in every respect it is as i noted above both very dark and very funny  the writing is fantastic and the plot is insane and the movie includes a sex scene that is incredibly intense and the characters dont even appear slighty disrobedin the words of craig schwartz played by john cusack this movie is a metaphysical can of worms turn on your brain and laugh heartily,black_comedy
wow this is the kind of movie i wish i had come up with at last were having a decent american comedy without too much morality or hilarity i put comedy between  as some people may refer to the word as being nonintellectual and cheap not this movie its well thought of and the acting is good and john malkovich is well no words really 8 12 out of 10,black_comedy
oh please come on was david lynch in on this one john not,black_comedy
spoiler is a thoughtprovoking strikingly original motion picture you gotta be on drugs or a genius to come up this stuff it really is something else john cusack is a funny cat as the dorky guy catherine keener is a real bitch in this movie and cameron diaz is a closet lesbian if they couldnt get john malkovich to play himself in this movie they would have been screwed oh and its funny how john malkovich just decides to be a puppeteer one day and then everyone in the world just loves john malkovich and his puppeteering crap bye,black_comedy
i didnt know what to expect from this movie i thought it would be a really weird freaky movie it had it share of weirdness sure but turns out its alot more as well its an absolutely hilarious comedy a drama a great salute to john malkovich who kind of ironically does one of the best performances in his career and a great piece of arti throughoutly enjoyed the comedy in the movie the conversations with charlie sheen and malkovich are great and malkovich dancing the puppet dance is just so sillylooking i didnt know weather to laugh or cry so i did bothi wont give it a perfect score as a movie due to some inconstansities in the plot and some not that good acting but as a work of art the projection of creative minds jonze malkovich  kaufman great stuff,black_comedy
this is the first time in a good while that ive thought repeatedly of bailing out on a movie  and that with a movie id wanted to see for some timei found the premise promising from the start  i like john malkovich as an actor and it sounded like a creative fun way to go  i looked for a fun imaginative timethe creative forces however thought otherwise  possible spoilers ahead they thought this would be a great time to create unlikable amoral vicious clueless characters and have them carry the movie  they thought themes of adultery new forms of sexual perversion just what we needed and constant sexual banter would be daring and risky and great cocktailparty fodderwell maybe it was for them but it isnt for me  ive never thought adultery was funny or interesting and odds are excellent that i never will and that was a central theme married man pursues vicious despicable woman only to be joined in the pursuit by his wife  ho ho ho how cuttingedge  yawnim thinking my 5 was overgenerous as i write  i do not recommend the film  a clever idea was poured through a filthy sieve pity,black_comedy

i admit that i wanted to see this film for the sheer absurdity of the premise but i was oh so pleasantly surprised to find that it was an amazingly funny i wasnt expecting thisjohn cusack was fabulous his character was at the beginning a lovable oaf who dreams of making a living as a puppeteer but settles for a job as a filing clerk for a company situated on the 712 floor of an office building which has amazingly low ceilings its when he discovers the portal to john malkovich that his dreams start to become a little maniacalive never been impressed much with cameron diaz but i have a whole new respect for her as an actress after seeing this film she is almost unrecognizable as john cusacks wife lottie with no makeup and frizzy brown hairand as always john malkovich was superb i highly recommend this film to everyone dont let the premise turn you off its brilliantly acted and intelligently funny and the cameo of charlie sheen was sheer genius,black_comedy
every once in awhile a film slips by the editing shears of the hollywood conventionalists bringing to the screen an unconventional and very unique idea  is one such filmthis is the story of craig schwartz john cusack a puppeteer who dreams of making a living simply by working at his craft  his passion for his work gets him into trouble as he lets loose his most bizarre fantasies via his puppets  working in the street he is attacked by a father whose daughter is witness to two marionettes pining mercilessly for one anothercraigs wife lottie cameron diaz takes in unwanted and abused animals and because of that craig is forced to find a real job  an ad in the classified talks about a job for someone dexterous enough to file quickly craig investigatesthe job is on the 7 12 floor of a new york city office building  to get there one must stop the elevator at just the right time and then pry open the door  because the office space is literally between the 7th and the 8th floor one must literally hunch over to get through it  if this sounds quirky youre right  and this is just the beginningone day craig finds a small door hidden behind one of the filing cabinets the door leads to a tunnel  when craig enters he is suddenly sucked through a vortex and before long he finds himself literally inside john malkovich the actor  and this is where the story really takes off into a strange plotline that is neither predictable nor conventionalseems destined to become one of those films that will constantly be rediscovered  in the tradition of great cult classics like harold and maude eating raoul and pink flamingos is not for all tastes but it will hold up for the next generation of movie cultistswhile the film is a bit slow in parts it is never dull  the acting was great  john cusack is usually the straight man in his films but this time he tries to put a little character in his performance  for the most part it works  diaz is barely recognizable in her role as the frizzyhaired animal lover  in fact i didnt know it was her til i saw the closing credits katherine keener plays the bitchy maxine who quickly decides that this vortex could have dollar value  keener avoids playing  her character over the top and judging by the absuridity of the script that couldnt have been easyperhaps the biggest treat in this film was the performance of malkovich playing himself  the script takes constant jabs at the actor  while fans on the street cant recall what they have seen him in others that do know of him call him completely over rated  while the actor in the film could not stand the thought of people inside his head one must wonder what the real actor thought of a film that highlighted his supposed weaknesses on top of being a twisted little flick about being someone else this film had elements of the player in it  there is a scene with charlie sheen playing himself that almost makes us want to forgive him for turning in heidi fleise spwithout a doubt i recommend but i strongly caution anyone on this  this film is not for all tastes but rather for those who take delight in quirky little films that chose not to be predictable,black_comedy
it would take much more than 1000 words to describe this movie so i wont try  suffice it to say that youll not soon see one like it  its its own genre  from the casting against type of cameron diaz to the bizarre premise on which the movie is based it seems an unlikely candidate for a very funny comples movie  but it surely is that    and more,black_comedy
i couldnt wait to see this movie ever since the first time i saw the trailer which i believe to be one of the best trailers ever the screenplay is singular in its presentation of a concept that to most extents would seem absurd the ability to be within another persons head and the reactions and events that spring from such a situation if you want to enjoy a movie that has given a new direction to originality in screenwriting go see this i dont want to say anymore as im afraid of spoiling any of the sheer joy of watching this film for anyone,black_comedy
the concept of people entering another persons brain and seeing the world through that persons eyes would certainly be original but add the fact that the person is a famous actor and the plot may sound gimmicky however it would be an injustice to delegate this movie to gimmick status because the sharp plot the witty dialogue the surreal visuals and the good cast make it the best movie ive had the pleasure of seeing so far this yearalthough the movie did not start off right away with the concept of entering john malkovichs mind it was just great seeing john cusack take on another unforgettable role as craig the puppeteer i was totally absorbed by his puppeteering not to mention the fact that seeing him and cameron diaz look so bizarre was worth the price of admission alone further besides craigs failure at making a living with a puppeteer his marriage is pretty much deficient too both of these spheres from his life come to a crash when he finds a new job where he meets the woman he is really in love with and where hes lucky enough to stumble onto a passageway into the actor john malkovichs brain this is where the movie gets very surreal but luckily it never seems too silly for its own good i dont want to spoil anymore about what happens next because it includes one of the funniest moments captured on filmlet me just say that my worries about spike jonze being like most video directors turned movie directors all style and no substance is now put to rest and i am eagerly looking forward to his next full length feature i was also happy to see that the concept wasnt too gimmicky or weird for its own goodi now feel the movie is the best of this year although another film may yet take that honor this year theres no way that a more original movie could come out this year i hope that charlie kaufman is recognized for his outrageous concept and if he isnt at least nominated for many screenwriting awards this year ill be very upset,black_comedy
i had high hopes for this movie i remember the rounds of ecstatic reviews i had heard glowing praise from friends and the premise well it sounded really good on paperit wasnt 40 minutes in that i found myself trapped inside a particularly wretched episode of mystery science theater 3000 like tom servo at the end of his rope i found myself literally screaming end damn you movie end well my actual comments were considerably more profane but you get the ideathis is a terrible film it caused me great physical pain i wish to find all the people responsible for it and subject them to two hours of something equally painful like forcing them to listen to scratchy slim whitman lps at 78rpm or watch endless 3d film loops of rosie odonnell braiding her armpit hair i wish to educate these pretentious bds that odd is not the same thing as clever that obnoxious is not the same thing as edgy that there is a razorthin line between showing contempt for your characters and showing contempt for your audience and that comedy should actually be funny dammit and then id feed them to starving wolverines just out of spitei am not familiar with director spike jonzes oeuvre but i enjoyed his convincing portrayal of a redneck imbecile in three kings about a thousand times more than this execrable cinematic wankathon the latteswilling twits who laud this film as an original work of daring vision evidently live in a universe where terry gilliam was smothered at birth made by poseurs for poseurs it is unrelentingly obtuse phony idiotic and boring not to rip from roger ebert but i hated hated hated this movieill give it points for a fine cast and a cool concept both utterly wasted and some absolutely brilliant puppetry scattered here and there between endless bouts of wacky psychosexual tedium pity it couldnt have been two hours of the puppets instead of this pseudohip beretwearing nonsense an extremely grudging 2 out of 10 for this crap movie,black_comedy
is really a very good movie it is not as good as the 1010 posters would say but is far better than many of the detracting posters make it i would give it maybe a 788 out of 10 it is truly bizarre insane and overthetop i kept asking myself how do people make up this stuff but that is not the burning question the buring question is was that puppetry real or special effects if real i would pay to see such a performance it was mesmerizing it was fantastic if it was real my criticism of the film is this i think it would have been a bit better if it had been directed by terry gilliam the movie starts out strange but after a few minutes you get used to the strangeness by maintaining the same level of insanity throughout the movie it seems to run out of steam it should have gotten slowly but progressively weirder and weirder like a terry gilliam movie my two favorite lines in the movie are when lottie says suck my dick and when after craig departs his body malkovich says i    im free but what made that line funny is what happens immediately after craig continued to pursue maxine a long time after i would have told her to get off i liked charlie sheens small but hilarious role i am sure after i see the film a couple more times and reflect on it i will figure out why it took place on the 712th floor why lottie had so many animals especially a disgusting chimp and why john malkovich why not harrison ford or rip taylor,black_comedy
i set my expectations high for this movie i thought it was going to be excellent since ive liked all john malcovichs movies other than this one he was completely outstanding in the portrait of a lady and dangerous liaisons but this is certainly disappointing i never thought id regret to have rented this anyway i think it was completely unrealistic however its truly original despite everything i really enjoyed the movie a little the plot was originally made because i think many people wish they could have been someone else it makes me think a lot as to who id like to be we are all supposed to be like we are this movie taught me i mustnt wish to be another person since god created everybody as equal we all must thank god for all the things hes ever given us this is a good life lesson but i dont think the movies purpose was to teach about it since it just minded about sex greediness and stuff like that john malcovich plays himself very well as well as john cusak and cameron daz which i didnt recognize at all i just found out about it her hairstyles and dresses were not flashy at all her character was quite bothersome and sick however catherine keen played the part better since she was very well cast to star as maxine but i couldnt believe she got an academy award nomination for best actress in a supporting role i dont think she was that great to get itall in all this is an original movie i really never thought a movie could have this sort of plot which makes it rather interesting its the only thing worth watching nevertheless the ending was a shame i just couldnt believe two women fell in love and took care of their child 510,black_comedy
so no one will get me wrong i wish to assure you that i did enjoy this movie yet it was disappointing because i had heard a lot about it and even though i might not have expected something better but i had expected something differenthas a lot of talented actors and i maybe most outstanding are john cusack and cameron diaz but i cant help feeling that that does not help im not very fond of the story in particular maybe its just too different and philosophical for mein my opinion this is a movie quite a bit over average but not a top movie and with all the hype going around i was a bit disappointed 710,black_comedy
i was really looking forward to this movie because it seemed interesting but there was a problem with this movie in that it did not transport me really good movies i find transport me into another world but for some odd reason this movie simply did nothard to put the finger on it but it seemed to be a whole slew of little things like the bad humoured maxine or the overreactive wife  it all seemed to be a bit too surreal and too far fetched  it almost seemed to me that everybody was trying too hard at their characteri do not think the storyline was bad  i was rather impressed with the story line  with different actors or a different director probably would have been a real blockbuster  all in all the movie simply did not turn out,black_comedy
spike jonze is a famous music video director  he is not a famous movie director  illustrates whythere are too many mood shifts  malkovich has the feel of a sequence of independently crafted scenes strung together by someone who injected his differing mood into each  every few minutes you get a completely different feel  that is great in a sequence of music videos where you have maybe 4 minutes to shock the audience with something that will make them remember a particular song then move on to a completely new song with its own unique feel  fatboy slims weapon of choice the jonze video with a dancing christopher walken was brilliant for that reason creating an instant mood that cannot as the video itself makes abundantly clear be sustained after the song ends  this movie has a scene that is almost a carbon copy of that dance routine malkovich dancing around his bedroom but which leads nowhere seems intended just to mix things up and then just ends  thud ok on to the next bizarre scene  just like in a music videoanother example is the catherine keener character  she does a nice job with a classic independentfilm style character  first she is presented as a prototypical mankiller  then having shocked us with that she becomes sexually ambiguous  shocking  then she becomes a big seductress  oh boy then she becomes a lesbian  outrageous  then she becomes  it all feels disjointed  clever but with inept character development and pacing for a serious film that cant decide whether it is a comedy or a drama or simply an mtv goof moviethe plot is simply weird  there are indeed buildings in nyc with hidden floors used by real estate barons and the like ive been on one interesting use of a littleknown fact  the version in this film though is so offthewall that it becomes a distraction  with high concept ideas like that it seems at times like an extended saturday night live skit if you are going to do what turns into a sentimental drama such obvious sight gags detract from the flow i like snl but their sketches are best left on tv where they belongthe casting is eccentric  i think john cusack is miscast  his image is simply too cleancut to pull off the failingpuppeteer routine and while he is supposed to play a weak character that leaves a weak center to this film  cameron diaz apparently wanted a change of pace from her glamourgirl comedienne roles and she sure got that  she does fine early on when she is put in some droll situations but falls down toward the end when the sentimentality starts in earnestas for john malkovich himself you keep expecting him to just bust out and do something bold like well john malkovich  he almost pulls this off in the scene where he dons a baseball hat confronts the people selling tickets tohim and gets into a knockdown fight  that is the moment in the film that springs to life and makes you think that he might actually wind up doing something interesting  indeed it leads into the films cleverest scene  but then we return to the malkovichaszombiecontrolledbyothers routine and he loses focus  you can virtually see the spark leave him which is a fine acting job but a miserable detraction from the film  if you have an exciting actor why not turn him loose  let him fight against his predicament or something  instead the script hamstrings him and makes him walk around in a virtual dazeoverall an interesting failure  and no you cannot get from an office in midtown manhattan to the nj turnpike in under 15 minutes  try it some time two stars out of four,black_comedy
best thinking mans comedy beats monty python in wackiness superbly pulled off by the two straightfaced johns how did they do ita must see,black_comedy
to rich to explain here suffice it to say that if you love movies youll see this film  wonderful acting an original story riddled with fresh ideas and a tight package by one of the greatest directors alive spike jones  this is what good films should be  music by carter burwell collaborator of the coen brothersyoull leave laughing and excited about this movie  maybe the crown jewel of malkovichs careersee it see it see it see it see it see it see it see it,black_comedy
i gave this movie 810 but i have to admit being a little disappointed when i finally got around to seeing itthe first half is almost flawless  a dystopian kafkaesque world designed seemingly by terry gilliam inhabited by offkilter characters that adds to the general air of strangeness and unreality striding through it all is an unrecognisable cameron diaz and the once again brilliant john cusack yet then it seemed that the initial promise somehow slips away the film shifts its focus from cusacks character to malkovich himself and the less screen time that cusack gets the more the film loses its momentum to what i considered to be an unsatisfactory finale there also seemed an element of over explanation in the final scenes  why not just leave the audience wonderingstill a brave and original piece of film making all round script  direction would that more films took risks like this did,black_comedy
it is very seldom that you see a movie like no other a plot that we havent seen before proves that all stories havent been told takes your mind on a rollercoaster trip go see it,black_comedy
this is one of those movies that i can clearly see both sides of the argument  its one of those movies that youll either walk away shaking your head in disappointment or youll be headed for the nearest movie store to pick it upas we sat back to watch this movie i knew immediately it wasnt going to be the kind of movie i typically enjoyed  but very quickly i realized this movie wasnt typical in any way  there was something strangely captivating and even humorous in a dark and twisted way about this moviejohn cusack shows the flexibility of his acting talent in this film playing the part of a semiinsane nice guy and cameron diaz shows that she too actually has some talent playing a sexually confused housewife  how in the hell they managed to make her look that bad ill never knowall in all it was an experience i actually ended up enjoying thoroughly although i cant tell you exactly why  definitely a good movie to watch with a few friends and beer,black_comedy
having misunderstood the idea of the film i thought it was to be a semiautobiographical documentary i was pleasantly surprised to follow the superb yarn which isits blend of irreverent yet subtle humour that is reminiscent of monty python draws you into the film immediately  early on as the puppeteer craig schwartz john cusack is punched for his bizarrely delicate puppetry of a horny monk we are introduced to the central irony of the film to be passionate in any way is to be ridiculous while also being made aware of a more serious image the tragic isolation of the artist  the film tells its jokes  which all tend to ridicule ardent emotion in some way or another  with a straight face  john malkovich is flattered and touched that one of his fans loved his portrayal of retard lenny of mice and men 1992 yet the fans passionate appreciation is belied by his insensitivity his callous use of the term retardthere follows a strong storyline punctuated with ugly  yet fascinating  humour schwartz possessing malkovichs body as if it were one of his puppets and maxine discuss making love on malkovichs table before eating an omelette off it  nooo shouts malkovich desperately as he momentarily regains control the horror of the vulgar proposal giving him strength to break out through schwarz   later we also watch in amazement as a chubby john malkovich  schwartz dances like a puppet for the entertainment of maxine hideous yet rivetingmaxine catherine keener the ultimate callous bitch is a superb character acted well  we are given hints as to her insanity such as the sex and omelette suggestion but for the best part she is simply an uncaring heartless manipulator  she is vain to the point of obscenity  to have two people staring at you with complete lust through the same pair of eyesits quite a rush  she toys with schwartz and his wife pitching them against each other in a love triangle of which she has complete control  in a film that ridicules emotion she is the only character to come off without looking absurdthe ability to control others is the main theme of the film  maxine does so by making others desire her and schwartz is obsessed with getting inside the skin of others as a puppeteer  this links the audience with the actors we too are watching events unfold through the eyes of others  the film explores the way art can break down the barriers between self and other how for example when watching a film you can empathise with a character  become them momentarily  but how at the same time they are becoming you after watching betty blue how many women have felt psychotic  it raises questions about selfhood are we just one self or are there many people inside our minds making us do things or say things friend and family for example influencing the way we thinkschwartz is repressed he can only experience things when he puts himself in the role of someone else and his ultimate punishment is complete repression being trapped in a childs mind unable to ever express himself through his vessel  we get the impression that he is basically an good man driven insane by his obsession with maxine and what she represents complete freedom from the pains and inhibitions of emotion  he claims i dont want to be a monster and he is indeed a lousy bad guy  he waits with a gun for his wife to come home hiding under the table  under a table in his own house  then he bursts out on her falls over himself in his rush to grab her by which time the element of surprise is lost but it was not even necessary since she is completely unprepared to be assaulted by her own husband  the dance of his puppet  a puppet which looks like himself  is the manifestation of his failure as a man  the dance of despair and disillusionment he calls it and it is an allegory of his despair at not being loved by maxine whom he loves rather pathetically because she is incapable of loving him back and his disillusionment with the world that doesnt appreciate his artcusack and keener are amply backed up by cameron diaz playing the innocent and vulnerable wife of schwartz who ultimately becomes maxines lover  it is a convincing performance by diaz which shows off her acting talent in a way that no other film has  although she is unattractive  unrecognisable  for the whole film she is very easy to watch  despite the absurdity of the plot premise being the existence of a tunnel which leads you into the mind of john malkovich the package we are presented with is so consistently well done that its easy to suspend ones disbelief  elements of the basic cinematography such as the subtle almost natural lighting unlike a normal cinema film particularly apparent in the schwartz apartment are easy on the eyes and brain  throughout the film you feels like youve been here before  whether it is people moving like zombies from some black and white 50s film as they navigate the 7 and a halfth floor with their arms flopping forward or malkovich singing malkovich malkovich malkovich a la fabulous baker boys 1989 we are on familiar screen territory  the monty python influence is more clearly seen on the dvd with its quack anatomical diagrams is the most unique film i have ever seen  8  10john malkovichs opens the door for charlie sheen masheen      malcatraz,black_comedy
is possibly the funniest horror movie of all time  it is a very disturbing exploitation comedy in the vein of olgas girls about a man whos head is invaded by a bunch of loser head cases who do not know how to live their own liveseventually a hippiewannabepuppeteer who is in lustful competition with his new age wife for the affections of the evil maxine takes over john malkovichs body instead of just indulging in voyeurism like the other head casesthe hippie puppeteer wins both john malkovichs and the evil maxines bodies for a while but is he too big a looser to hold onto them  are there other sinister forces that want to make john malkovich their own  will no one come to john malkovichs aidis a very sick very funny movie that would raise cries of protest from the usual suspects if instead of a middleaged white bald guy the victim were say xenia seeberg or neve campbellbut because of the humor philosophizing and fullyclothed sex scenes few people will be aware of the nature of the film they are viewing,black_comedy
this movie is probably the closest hollywood will come to avantgarde filmmaking its a fascinating kafkaesque little tale as i imagine every review is probably describing it about celebrity personal identity puppets and the new jersey turnpike performances are great allaround  john cusack as a misunderstood puppeteer john malkovich as both himself and john cusack cameron diaz as a woman less attractive than cameron diaz  definitely worth seeing,black_comedy
this is a trip to the circus sideshow freaks and all and shouldnt be confused with anything more profound a lot of fun to watch certainly but this movie misses an opportunity to explore just what is involved in taking over another human beingphysically psychologically emotionallyanyone really interested in such themes of subjugation of one individual by another should have a look at an old classic ingmar bergmans persona which examines in detail a process in which one stronger personality overwhelms another bjm isnt too deep but is endlessly inventive darkly humorous and features one of the most bizarre scenes ever committed to film youll know it when you see it,black_comedy
the craziest funniest thoughtful living terrific motion picture my eyes ever seen and of course my soul this movie make you forget all your little problems in your life it makes the moment a little brighter,black_comedy
this is a brilliant movie it brings up so many questions about who we actually are what makes us tick what makes us say what we say and do what we do spike jonze amazes with this film  a total unexpected surprise also a huge surprise from john cusack and cameron diaz  who are both great  definetely their best performances of their careers so far vote 95 out of 10,black_comedy

i was horrified to think that everyone enjoyed this movie  i was thrilled that so many people agreed with me that this movie is complete trash  it cant decide what it wants to be  it starts out as a satire then it becomes science fiction and finally it gets almost  pornographic with lesbians and monkeys  this movie made absolutely no sense  ive had thirteen people claim to understand it and each of their explanations vary considerably  no one understands this film and if anybody claims they do they are liars  i think the only reason this film was critically acclaimed is because the critics were embarassed that they didnt get it  they felt it was original and artsy and therefore should probably get a good review i agree with them that this film was original an orginal piece of crap that is  dont see this film  in the name of all that is holy avoid it at all costs  you will be left confused and the people who make this crappy make no sense movie will have more money to create more stupid movies for people to not understand and critics to somehow love,black_comedy

just because a movie is strange and original doesnt mean its good sorry artsyfartsy poseur bandwaggoners but its true case in point a motion picture with a bizarre but interesting premise that gives rise to a bizarre fragmented indecisive mess of a filmthe main character john cusack is a downonhisluck puppeteer who lives with an unattentive peteccentric wife cameron diaz searching for a real job brings him to an office building with a 7 12 floor where everyone treats him like he is the nutty one he meets an attractive coworker and woos her but she thinks hes a hopeless weirdo then one day after moving a cabinet to retrieve a document cusack discovers a small door that leads him on a crazy rollercoaster ride and lands him inside actor john malkovich it only lasts 15 minutes but he is changed forever he uses his new discovery as a way to attract his attractive coworker and soon they have people lining up to be john malkovich like it was an amusement park ridethats about where any of the good stuff ends the rest of the film is a confused convoluted mess of twists and strangeness so weirdly played you dont know whether to laugh or shake your head sadly when a comedy is played so straight you dont know when to laugh its pretty bad the same thin ruined usa channels national enquirer show i dont care how beautifully malkovich was photographed or how unique the script was or how good the acting was if they did a shakespeare film dressed like the characters from sesame street it would be original but still crap a drugfantasy cooked up by the slightlymore sophisticated counterparts of beavis and butthead is all that this film amounts to it cant make up its mind whether to be comedic or a social commentary satire so it decides to just be so of course everybody ate it upif you want to see an actually deep poetic and beautiful movie watch american beauty pass on this trumpedup wad of nonsense12 out of ,black_comedy
i think this is one the weirdest movies i have ever watched as many reviews have already stated i would say too that the idea is absolutely original however i do not see why many people seem to think that this idea was wasted in this movie in my opinion the story was very well told with unpredictable turnsbut the ending or rather the explanation of why such a thing as a portal to john malkovichs head exists could have been completely left out i think it would have been even better not to try to put the existence of that door in the office on any semirational basis just let it be as unexplainable and weird as eg why you get thrown out at the new jersey turnpikes that would have been much more consistent for such a weird moviehowever the real final ending again for the three main actors is worth seeing and a good solution in my opinion the movie leaves you in an interesting mood and makes you think  i would give it a 8 out of 10,black_comedy
this is a brilliantly original movie virtually hilarious throughout with numerous memorable quotessee the imdb listing though they appear to have missed one of my favoritesthe i comes before u  onethe writer filmmakers and actors all deserve top honors for contributing to a masterpiece of black comedy especially in my view the actress playing maxinewho simply sizzlesthe genius of this film is that the more preposterous the plot the more absorbing it becomes many reviewers have in essence interpreted this film as what it is like to have ones 15 minutes of fame i view this film as examining with great humour the concept of beingplayed for and with maximum laughs and in my opinion the strength of the picture lies in its uncanny ability to examine that concept with an array of compellingly super characters this is a feelgood film a surefire 10 out of 10,black_comedy
i was very excited to watch this film with overwhelming praise from sources i trusted  i was very disappointed as this movie turned out to be extremely overrated  the jokes were few and just ok cusack i am vexed by and dont know why though i like his movies  i dont like the way it presents important philosophical concepts and i didnt think the movie was so mindblowingly original as people made it out to be  it reminded me of how seemingly original artistic creations are initially when hyped up by an audience used to tired genres  well see for yourself,black_comedy
what i great line especially when a monkey reminisces on a past experience with rope i mean either charlie kaufman is a genius writer or he is messed up man spike jonze is a great new director and would have loved to seen him play a bigger role in the film i thought fight club was pretty hardcore watch that movie too much and people accuse you of being messed blew me away didnt change my life but the movie was almost like nothing ive ever seen before watch it but only if you can take fight club,black_comedy
this film is inspired hilarious and unnervingly touching the script is absolutely original and the characters interaction between each other very funny the scenes between keener and cusack are wonderfulthe other day i was buying a hat and had my first reallife loden experience you will remember loden is malkovichs second choice color for his bath towels when he finds periwinkle is out of stock well i was picking out a hat at a haberdashery and as i checked out the label i saw that the color was loden it was hilarious but impossible to explain to the clerki cant believe was overlooked by the academy this year it truly was better than anything else and it has advanced film and humor theory forward more than any movie in a long time in that respect it has a lot in common with pulp fictionit also would have been nice to hear the following surreal announcement at the oscars and the oscar goes to john malkovich for,black_comedy
 warning contains spoilers when first came out i didnt have much interest in seeing it a lot of people i knew told me that it wasnt good so took their advice i really didnt even know much about the movie at all then one night it was on and i had nothing else to watch so i took a chance despite many of my friends complaints the first couple of minutes were kind of slow not badjust a little slow one of the reasons i stayed with it was because of cameron diazs extremely unique look quite different from her usual  but the movie picked up quickly and i was engulfed in it the idea is wonderful and original how many movies have you seen where a person pays 200 dollars to go inside the head of john malkovich for 15 minutes and then be thrown out into a ditch beside the new jersey turnpikewhen many movies end you get up and walk out of the theater and you never think about the movie again not this movie when it ended i turned off the television and i went to wash the dishes during the entire time i couldnt get the movie out of my head and that night when i went to sleep i still thought about it i just couldnt get it out of my head that is the definition of a great movie a movie that is still with you even after you experience it the ending credits left me in an errie mood i love movies like this i cant even describe it but if you like strange movies that leave you thinking then please do yourself a favor and rent if you like movies that leave after you watch it rent shes all that,black_comedy
is a film with multiple deeps and is in fact a very complex and black as first you might see the film as a bare comedy as it appears to be very simple in its way of telling and simple photography but behind this surface lays something very familiar to as all the greed to become someone we doesnt are the grass is greenerthe main actors will to become john malkovich so that he can fulfil his dreams is also a problem in our daily life no one will take you serious until you have made a name and when you have made a name you can make everything and everything will sale as for example pablo picassoi gave this film a 10th out of 10 cause to its multiplicity and that this film is not as predictible as most of the films now,black_comedy
american beauty was good but didnt this movie have a better plot more original than any other movie of that year its as twisted as alice in wonderland but modern and more surrealmany give the credits of this film to spike jonze i dont know why i prefer to give it charlie kaufman for his plot his originality just stood outeverybody in the movie was strong and powerful in terms of acting loved the scene with the chimpanzees flashbackgave it 1010,black_comedy
no matter what people saythink of this movie it is one of my favorites the plot is odd the characters even more so and it is refreshing to watch a movie where the skills of the actors are more important than the outer beauty of the actors this movie is in my list of must owns like dead again magnolia the usual suspects fight club and sleepers all of these movies have great acting talent and plot enjoy ,black_comedy
it was so unbelievable that i could sit through 120 minutes of pure junk i expected much more out of this movie because i enjoy john malkovichs body of work and talent during his distinguished careeri first noticed malkovich in con air when he portrayed cyrus the virus grissom really well i have since followed his career in amazement i can not believe how the writers could give the actors a poor script to work withfrom beginning to end i was lost in a maze of dialogue and bad development as well as execution on everyones part that i wanted to leave after 30 minutes however something told me to stick with because one never knows what will happen later on i was disappointed to learn that there was nothing worthwhile to see and i wasted my time on an awful movie furthermore to make matters worse the rest of the cast couldnt even save the moviei do not recommend this film to anyone nor would i allowed to be paid to watch it again,black_comedy
this film is a flatout must see  if you like odd smart humor you will love being john malkovitch  i just saw it and ill probably go to see it again tomorrow to try and figure it all out  a great reference to case western reserve university  suberbly written and directed this is a film that will have you talking and thinking and laughing about it for hours after its over honestly,black_comedy
spoiler be warnedthis is one of my favorite movies ive watched it several times and it keeps taking on new meanings other contributors on this site have found the emphasis on sexuality and lesbianism objectionable but in my opinion these elements are instrumental in expressing what appears to be an essential moral message craig is not satisfied with his life he wants something more and better in order to fulfill his dreams he eats the forbidden fruit ie hijacking john malkovich and as a result of his hubris he eventually loses everything including his wife his marriage with lotte  though dull and unsatisfying to both of them  could perhaps have been saved and improved somehow if it hadnt been for their mutual exploitation of malkovichas for the scenes dealing with sex and lesbianism i find them far less disturbing than the scene in which craig threatens lotte with a gun and locks her up in a cage bound and gagged up to that point i had no problem identifying with craig and feeling empathy for him despite his problems and weaknesseson my scale this movie gets ten stars out of ten,black_comedy
is a very strange movie the storyline is one thats never seen before a man finds a door that goes into the head of john malkovich thats pretty weird but thats goodthis film is clearly a satire on hollywood if you ask me and if you disagree email me the puppets of john cusacks character are clearly a metafor for actors these days and that everybody goes in john malkovich his head is clearly a statement that many people want to be someone else somebody famousthe acting is great john cusack is with edward norton  brad pitt one of the most talented actors these days and catherine keener is very good as thegirlwhosayswhatshethinks only cameron diaz isnt very good because she is overactingi rate it 8 out of 10,black_comedy
i have to admit that the first time i saw this movie like many other people who have commented on it i did not particularly like it i thought it was unique and original and i really like the office setting with the low ceilings but the overall story was kinda boring however for some reason i started watching this movie again when it came on cable and really got into it i did not even realize cameron diaz was in the movie until i saw it for a second time i have since seen it for a 3rd time and enjoyed it even more i agree with the comments by jon dye that this movie really grows on you it is a nice break from the norm and just an overall well made interesting movie,black_comedy
acting is great the characters are interesting and funny  remarkable plot twists with a quirkiness that really works  i laughed outloud a lot and enjoyed it enough to go out and buy the dvda good movie to see again with your friends that have above average iqsa must own movie,black_comedy
that i have seen in a film in a long time and brilliantly executed diaz breaks away from her screen goddess image and cusack revives himself after the yukky  high fidelity  one of the years best a definite must see  ,black_comedy
contains spoilersthis very neat film should hold particular appeal to those who have seen john malkovich in other films not just him as that jewel thiefbjm is well realized superbly acted keener cusack diaz and orson bean are winners and deftly paced in it are hilarious and memorable scenes that will stick with you until such time as it becomes necessary to move on to that next ripe vesseli would suggest viewing this film when you believe its time to selfmedicate with strong doses of nonreality and movie escapism if anything in this review has given you cause to scratch your cranium do what you must see this movie 910,black_comedy
malkovich is something that grows on you a fungus of the film kind if you see it only once you probably will be mad about a few little things and slightly amused about others but it will stick in your mind youll wonder about where the plank went during the whole movie youll wonder how all the old people are running the body youll wonder if he really is peeing orange but mostly youll be wondering if it is still in stock at the rental place watching again you laugh more but it will still make you want to see it again and again and again and that is why it is so good seeing a good movie once is easy dwelling on a great movie is devine,black_comedy
spoiler alerti dont know what all the praise is about i started to enjoy the beginning about the puppeteer looking for a job followed by the weird office on the 7 12 floor and i laughed at orson bean as the peculiar bossand then john cusack found the entranceway to malkovichs mind and i actually got more disinterested rather than more intriguedactually the story is not a new one if youve seen decades of horror and scifi films as well as twilight zone episodes after all is anything original in films anymore furthermore there was a germ of a good story here but as is typical of modern films the film makers have a need to add mindless sex andor homosexuality when all else fails in this case the lesbian angle was completely unnecessary and helped ruin what should have been a better time at the movies,black_comedy
this film is so inspiring it nearly made me crythank you spike jonze fr giving us this piece of cinematic gold i can never see it enough times and john cusack will hopefully continue his marvellous career you are pardoned for pushing tin johnin fact im going to watch this again right nowmalkovich malkovich malkovich,black_comedy
this is a great great film it is unlike any film u have ever seen that in itself is a reason to see it the directing acting and story line are all top notchunexpectedly funny and what movies are supposed to be  a must see for all film students spike jonzes film is an exercise in how to push the envelope and not be like the joness pun intended,black_comedy
unfortunately most wont get a chance to see this film at the theater  it will most likely only be a limited release unless it starts to make serious money but for those in markets large enough run to the theater  this movie is the most original film of the year  this premise on initial description sounds somewhat suspect  a out of work puppeteer takes a filing job and finds a portal inside of john malkovichs body where he can be john malkovich for 15 minutes  to explain anymore than that would be giving too much away  the less known the better  the script is smart and funny and the inspired ensemble cast is brilliant  the most winning aspect of this film is john malkovich for having the sense of humor to be cast as himself  the film is probably not for all tastes but if you are a fan of terry gilliam brazil 12 monkeys you will love,black_comedy
the possibility to see the world through someone elses eyes is something we all dream about at least once how would that happen well in this movie you just enter a secret door in an office a very strange office slide through a muddy tunnel and there you are looking through the eyes of john malkovich the famous actor the script is very clever and very funny unbelievable but very real i enjoyed it every second,black_comedy
is one very weird movie it almost defies categorization you cant help but wonder how the idea for the movie came about im betting alcohol was involved probably drugs toothe plot revolves around what happens when one of the characters discovers a portal into the head of john malkovich the actor you crawl through this door enter into this long tunnel and all of a sudden youre in john malkovichs head where youre seeing and experiencing everything that he is at that moment in time the experience is apparently quite thrilling so before long a business is set up and everyone is doing it including the famous actor himselfthe movie gets high marks for its originality and dark humour it also features one of the most twisted love triangles that ive ever seenon the downside the story loses focus at times and even drags in places overall though its a funny and enjoyable film even if it is a little bit bizarre if you have a bit of a dark sense of humour and are open to strange concepts then i highly recommend it 710,black_comedy
somewhere andy warhol is laughing and nodding approvinglyif anybody finally got his prediction of everyone being famous for fifteen minutes it was director spike jonze and writer charlie kaufman who used that conceit to whip up their freshman cinematic effort which is the oddest most uniquely unclassifiable original piece of filmmaking to come along in yearsthe meaning of geek finds a whole new level in john cusacks portrayal of the hapless puppeteer craig schwartz who gets punched out for presenting deeply cerebral and blatantly sexual public showcases such as his take on the doomed affair of abelard and heloise tired of being lambasted and in this particular case lacerated he finally relents to join the rat race at the urging of his kindly animal planetminded missus lotte cameron diaz in a deathdefyingly unglamorous rolethe dexterity that helps him with his puppets lands him a job at the mertinflemmer building on the 7 12 floor dont ask just take my word for it you have to see it to believe it as well as the hysterically funny pseudoorientation film that explains it it is here at this new gig that craig experiences several lifechanging eventsone he meets his centegenerean lech of a boss played with smarmy aplomb by orson bean and his object of desire a ditzy executive secretary played by the always awesome mary kay place two he finds his own sexual obsession in maxine a fabulous frigidaire of a female coworker rendered with wellpitched perfection by indie fave catherine keener who has turned playing brusque  brittle characters into an art formbut heres where it all gets really strange craig discovers a portal behind some filing cabinets in the office behind a tiny locked door which for all the world looks like a passage into wonderland but where it leads is even more wonderful and bizarrefor fifteen minutes you get to live inside the head of actor john malkovich seeing feeling and thinking everything that he does then when times up you find yourself expelled on the side of the new jersey turnpikewhere the hell is the logic in that who gives a rats ass not craig once hes experienced the rush of living inside someone elses skin especially a big celebrity certainly not maxine who automatically seizes on the more practical implications of craigs amazing discovery not lotte whose journey into johnnyland causes her to reevaluate her own sense of identity sexual and otherwiseand certainly not you dear viewer who will be so busy wrestling with what this incredible film has to say about unfulfilled promise unrealized dreams the unending quest to escape oneself by living vicariously through others when youre not laughing yourself silly or marveling at the sheer inventiveness of the cast and crew that all youll be thinking about is hitting the play button to see it over againthis is one of those rare films that demands repeat viewings during which youll find a slew of favorite freezeframeable moments my own personal highlight when a befuddled bewitched bothered and bewildered john malkovich playing a skewed doppelganger of himself goes through his own portal youll never look at selfcenteredness the same way againquirky spellbinding surprising sad pensiveyou could run out of superlatives praising bjm but as you can see if somebody asks you what its about it completely defies a oneline descriptionjust tell em what i did rent it then come back and well talkyoull both have plenty to say believe me this movie sure does and for once i can truly say that this picture was robbed by being passed over for a best picture oscar and sincerely mean it,black_comedy
at last an interesting story comes from hollywood with the added bonus of being the most original for a good long while tells the story of puppeteer craig schwartz the impeccable john cusack who discovers a tiny portal behind a filing cabinet at his new workplace which takes him on an amazing journey inside the head of john malkovich star of such films as empire of the sun 1987 and con air 1997  exactly why it is malkovich is anyones guest but craig decides to share the experience with his girlfriend lotte cameron diaz looking totally unrecognisable and sour work colleague maxine catherine keener  the latter hits upon the notion that there could be money in this discovery for herself and craig and they set up their own business taking people inside the head of john malkovich who for a while at least is unaware of what is going on inside his head   darkly humourous and ultimately quite touching is one of the mustsee films of 1999 and one you are unlikely to forget  the first time filmmaking duo of spike jonze director and charlie kaufman screenwriter have come up with a real gem and a film which surely deserved more recognition than it got on its release,black_comedy
this movie shows that it still is possible to make something original for the cinema screen john malkovich himself is brilliant the only problem for me watching him from now on will be that i will always associate him with this moviea moment that alone makes this movie worth watching is when the monkey has a flashbacki gave this movie 10 out of 10,black_comedy
i spend so much time bashing todays movies for being empty and imaginationstarved that im a little shocked when something like this comes along is breathtakingly original wonderfully warped and it sustains its demented tone all the way through rather than casting it aside at some convenient point to focus on another lame good vs evil showdown as so many other initially intriguing films do with a good example being dark citythe cast here is superb especially john cusacks lonely lovestruck puppeteer and catherine keeners emotionally unavailable ruthlessly unreachable object of seemingly everyones desire  the movie really belongs to her shes created one of the most fascinatingly inscrutable characters that i can recall and what wacky refreshingly blunt dialogue it has a cartoonish feel to it like their words are frying pans to conk each other on the head with from keeners i am dubious when cusack corners her for a date to her craig i dont find you attractive when he and his wife both attempt to seduce her at the same time or cusacks wife cameron diaz brutally telling him dont crowd me craig or charlie sheen in a funny cameo as himself explaining to a distraught malkovich that the truth is for suckers or a lukewarm fan telling malkovich you were really great in that movie where you played the retard and finally in one of the funniest lines i can remember malkovich after his reality has been severely tampered with screaming at some guy in a bar i am not john malkovich then attacking himthe movie careens off in all sorts of unanticipated directions while always remaining faithful to character and premise it explores notions of identity celebrity mortality and finality in a very unique way but at its core its really about the pain of loneliness and the inability to connect and it all climaxes with a truly ingenious and exciting chase scene what a gloriously nutty seductively sullen vision it will leave you a little dizzy when its done,black_comedy
weird  okay thats this movie in a word weird  i hated this movie  so let me get straight to the pointgood point  1  incredubly original plot  i mean i have never seen a movie quite like this one  i love the plot good point 2  it can be really funny  anything involving john malkovich is hilarious  its funny to see him react to this strangeness  the whole 712 floor bit is flat out funny  and john cusacks boss is pretty funnyokay on to the badbad point 1  john cusack  i like the man a little  i never gave him much thought really  but this  its not him really its the character  i hated him  i think that youre supposed to hate him  but how can you like a movie when you hate the main characterbad point  3 the weirdness  oh my is this movie weird  the whole puppet thing is just stupid  i know that because cusacks character is a puppeter allows him to fully control people but who really caresbad point  4  way too artistic  i go to movies to be entertained sometimes i go for study  sometimes i go to solve a puzzel usual suspects  but i never go to artistic movies  why  the same reason i think painters who throw a bucket of paint onto a canvis and call it art are insane and should be locked up  this movie is really depressing  the look of the movie is really dark the characters are dark the humor is dark though thats not really a bad thing and the themes are darkconclusion  i try to speak for the traditional movie goer  if your a normal person who works every weekday then goes to blockbuster on friday to relax dont rent this  the average person wouldnt like this  its just too weird  if youre into weird artsy movies then you will like this it all comes down to this  was it worth the money i paid to rent it no not by a long shot  i want my money back so i can rent something decent like seven samariby the way i dont care if i didnt spell something right  just sound it out putz,black_comedy
i had wanted to see for a long time after seeing it was placed on the top 250 and that it had excellent a reviewsjohn cusack is craig schwartz a stragglyhaired povertystricken puppeteer goaded by his animalfixated wife cameron diaz almost unrecognisable under a gigantic brown wig into getting a proper job which he does as a filing clerk on the seventhandahalf floor a gag which really has to be seen of a nondescript office building its here while working for a dotty centenarian boss orson bean and lusting after colleague maxine catherine keener that he stumbles upon the hidden portal that sucks unsuspecting parties straight into john malkovichs brain thus giving the person the opportunity to literally be john malkovich for 15 minutes before being spewed out beside the new jersey turnpike but what starts out as a moneyspinning novelty quickly descends into insanity as diaz discovers the joys of the portal keener discovers the joys of malkovich and malkovich slowly begins to twig that a bunch of complete strangers are messing with his headthe acting is brilliant in cusack has rarely been better and diaz hasnt done anything this amusing or creative in a long time but its catherine keener and john malkovich who stand out the most here keeners performance is wickedly enjoyable she deserved her oscar nomination and malkovich who really needed to get that academy award nomination over michael caine is amazing he pulls off the most superb performance of his career playing himself spike jonze is also a man i look forward to seeing more from his direction skills are ironically fascinating charlie kaufmans writing deserves an oscar and a golden globe because he has written the most original story i have ever seen in a filmat the end of youll be sitting there with your jaw dropped open because this film is such a mindblowing intelligent ride youll never ever see another film like this so for your own good dont miss outi rate 9 out of 10,black_comedy
im not going to talk long about the film just its one major problemthe problem was the lesbian thing that was so messed up if the gay girl thing had been out of the picture it would have been one of the best strange movies out there i enjoy john malkovich but if you want to see him in a nice role see him and clint eastwood in the movie in the line of fire,black_comedy
somebody please explain to me what all the fuss was about this picture is boring  boy am i glad i never got to see it in a theatre even renting the video was a waste of money the only performance worth seeing is that of john malkovich himself unpretentious true and almost shy why he would want to appear in this movie ill never know  must be vanity or something i sincerely hope they paid him well as intriguing as the idea of getting into somebody elses body and mind might seem this is not the way to portray it bad script bad everything what a waste of talent and imagination,black_comedy
brilliant writing and direction along with top rate acting by all of the major characters  a strange plot but very thought provoking  the camera work was great if not perfecthighly recommended,black_comedy
i liked this movie a lot it is super original great direction and a fabulous cast maybe the idea is better than the movie itself i cant say anyway it is worth while going to see it the puppet shows are amazing i had never seen puppet shows for adults and was completely overwhelmed with the artistic meaningful message that is passed on to the viewer,black_comedy
in my opinion this was the best movie of the 1990s mindboggling in its originality the movie is a masterpiece from start to finish the fact that it was not nominated for best picture  and john cusack for best actor  is a travesty i have watched this movie 4 times and will probably watch it 40 more,black_comedy
i was surprised to find out that so many especially american users disliked this film criticising it for being pretentious and unoriginal rather than funny i think the great forte of is its unique way of combining both avantgarde and humour which is unfortunately not very often combinedthe film challenges and plays with its viewers but it never escalates into something too grotesque or pointless i quite like cusacks protagonistthe pathetic and egocentric puppeteerhe left me with a strange ambivalent feeling even though he might be considered extremely selfish he isnt purely mean the main characters arent as stereotyped as in many other american films they arent just good or bad but they all have less flattering sides being jm is excellent and surreal  craigs boss might as well just have stepped out of lynchs universe an entertaining look into the world according to kaufmanjonze and the darker sides of america,black_comedy
this is the most strangest movie ever made   i dont think many would disagree  i cant say much about it except to rent it  you will not be disappointed  its hilarious its sad and its bizarre  i have no doubt that this movie will be remembered while the green mile cider house rules and the insider will undoubtedly be forgotten  the only thing i think that couldve made it stranger is if it was a musical too but maybe that would just be too much,black_comedy
all hail the insane genius of spike jonze i fell in love with this film from the brilliant opening puppet show treating us to a bizarre ride through life like people ride malkovicheh jonze goes through more emotions and styles than several films with both believable and insane characters thrust into the same situation and often the same head also three superb cameo appearances charlie sheen like john his greatest role is as himself sean penn on puppetry and a leering brad pitt look carefully this deserved best picture over the formulaic insider and the mundane american beauty    special mention to john himself a truly brilliant performance this film should be seen by everyone by law view the world through a completly different set of eyes,black_comedy
this is my favourite film of all time and before you ask yes ive seen the classics citizen kane seven samurai toy story 2  this is one of those ludicrously rare movies where it is so completely well written the monsterously barmy and complex plot is completely understandable and easy to follow at all times well i thought it was the acting is wonderful throughout the plot is tremendously original and works so well within its own twisted little world working along its own twisted logic  this is a deeply interesting film a deeply funny film and a deeply entertaining film  deeplyi love it and i am extremely proud to say that i for the first time in my life own my favourite film of all time ,black_comedy
this certainly was one of the most original movies to come down the pike in the last few years  but while the idea of a portal into someones mind is certainly interesting contained virtually no character that i had any emotional connection to at all  none of the main characters are likeable and the movie really starts to go downhill after the novelty of the portal wears off  the best acting performance by far is john malkovich and i like the fact that he was willing to poke fun at himself but overall i just think this is a very detached movie and certainly not deserving of the top 50 alltime rating it has on here right now  if youre looking for a unique film with some characters and situations to care about from 1999 check out three kings instead,black_comedy
i am against pointless movies  if a movie doesnt have a message it is pointless  entertainment without morals is the central idea behind hedonism  and for the mature viewer this movie failed to make any profound points  it just tries to be weird and different for the sake of being weird and different it was not funny it was not shocking it was just plain stupid,black_comedy
the best film of 1999 without a shadow of a doubtcraig schwartzcusack is a struggling puppeteerin order to make some money craig takes a job as a filling clerkone day he accidentally discovers a doora portal into the brain of malkovichthis is simply amazingover the top fun brilliant 1010,black_comedy
the premise of being able to portal oneself into malkovichs brain is quirky enough but thats only the launch point for this story which has more to do with relationships and sexuality as with anything else  one of the neat things is that the film continues to get stranger in its very premise as it progressesnever does it rest on its laurels and simply let the characters run through their pacestrue fine and funny speculative fiction very much in the philip k dick tradition  its been 10 days since i saw this film and i still cant stop thinking about it or discussing it with all who will listen,black_comedy
of all the negative comments i have seen on here none of them have had substance  it seems that none of them saw the movie or are bitter because they didnt get what the rest of us sawthis is a well shot inventive movie which stretches the imagination and makes one think about what is or could be possible  this is a deep film which works on many levels and perhaps for the overly literal minded viewer these fine points could be missed,black_comedy
in this day and age with all of the reissues remakes and directors cuts it is refreshing to see a film filled with original thought  a film such asis a rare commodity in todays violence and sexfilled cinema craig schwartz john cusack is an artist an extremely talented but frustrated artist who cant seem to catch a break he is frustrated that a competing artist despite his lack of talent gets all the work he has a loving wife lotte cameron diaz who wants him to get a job any job she wants to have children a nice home and a good life he doesnt want to compromise his art eventually however reality sinks in one day he answers an ad in the classifieds for a file clerk with fast hands and nimble fingers and the adventure begins  when he arrives for his interview he discovers a very strange atmosphere with some very odd characters he nails the interview and despite the bizarre surroundings gets the job  it is during his orientation that he meets another new employee maxine catherine keener with whom he is instantly smitten  he begins to flirt with her at every opportunity and she continuously shoots him down then one day purely by accident  he discovers something that will change his life forever this discovery it turns out is a portal into the mind and body of john malkovich   after entering and experiencing the sensation of a lifetime  he tells his sexy officemate and she convinces him that they should become partners in a very unusual business venturecraig then tells his wife of his new entrepreneurial adventure and she demands to experience the ride  but not before meeting maxine the two women immediately develop an unusual attraction to each other talk about an uncomfortable situation this predicament eventually pushes craig over the edge  he snaps and takes their alliance to a more perilous level craig ultimately begins to get some control over the host malkovich which causes a rift in the relationship between his wife and maxine  consequently john malkovich catches on and tries to put a stop to this invasion of his privacy its at this point that mr malkovich takes the strangest and most disturbing not to mention hilarious journey of his life  a heated argument between craig and the bewildered malkovich follows at the rather peculiar exit from the portal  malkovich makes it absolutely clear that he wants everyone to stay out of his head but its not that simple things have become too complicated in our gangs lives to stop now craig takes over malkovichs life and in the process misplaces his own he stays inside the portal and uses the fame of his host to further his own career  but is he really happy with his success ultimately this is the real question craig finally has the fame he wants and some would believe deserves but its not really him that gets the attention  it s malkovich can he accept,black_comedy
i couldnt have enjoyed this movie any more than i did but then im a guy who loves an absurd hilarious infinitely selfreflecting postmodern look at such matters as marriage puppeteering animal psychology orientation videos sex appeal gender confusion 60foottall emily dickensons pet obsession and the semicool mystique of secondtier celebrities so many laughs so many memorable scenes and such great performances especially that of jm himself what a fascinating way to change ones public image now what was the name of that jewel thief movie,black_comedy
is unlike any movie that i and probably you as well have ever seen  a crazy comedic fantasy that finds craig schwartz john cusack fiddling with the mind of the wellrespected actor john malkovich craig finds a portal into malkovichs mind in his office where you can see through his eyes for 15 minutes and then be dumped out onto the new jersey turnpike  he markets this new concept of being someone else with the help of his coworker maxine catherine keener who he falls madly in love with at the same time craigs wife lotte cameron diaz discovers the profoundness of herself through the portal and also falls madly in love with maxine  its a crazy messed up story that will keep you hooked to the screen to see what wild events will take place next  writer charlie kaufman has woven such a complex idea and concept into such an entertaining and imaginative story that director spike jonze brought to life  in his big screen directorial debut jonze takes us right into the mind of john malkovich along with the other characters and brings out the strangeness and innovation of kaufmans screenplay  the entire cast turns in wonderful performances especially john malkovich himself  im sure it wasnt to much of a stretch for him to play well him but he does it with such subtlety that it makes all the fantasy seem like reality for the viewer due in large part to jonzes directing as well  its a great movie and a mustsee for anyone in the mood for a little bit of the bizarre,black_comedy
i had heard was very good before i saw it and i seriously didnt expect it to be in my years top 10 but the film is so brilliant full of effort and unforgettable it would be hard for anyone to dislike it charlie kaufmans script was remarkable it should have won over alan balls american beauty and anyone could say that spike jonze also put alot of effort into this movie he is certain to be a big 21st century director the acting is also excellent cameron diaz and john cusack have rarely been better and catherine keener and john malkovich are simply a joy to watchif you havent seen you are really missing out on a clever interesting and brilliant film so i highly recommend you see it today anyone would say the same thingrating 10,black_comedy
to say this film is weird is an understatement  however it is one of the better strange films i have ever seen  john cusack is excellent in this film as is john malkovich himself  after all nobody but malkovich could pull this film off to begin with  cameron diaz is all but unrecognizable in her portrayal of lotte schwartz but her performance here is only hohum  i have learned not to expect much from her in anything but a comedy film anyways especially after seeing something about maryi recommend this film to those who want to see something fresh and who enjoy movies that call for some thought  i dont believe a story such as this has ever been tried before and that makes the film more appealing  i passed by it for a few weeks at the video store before committing to it and now im glad i watched itthe premise is pretty simple  while at work one day on the 7 12 floor craig schwartz john cusack who is a puppeteer finds a small door which allows him to enter the mind of john malkovich and see through his eyes for a short period of time and then be dumped out beside the new jersey turnpike  as word of this spreads various hijinks and interpersonal relations are played out amongst the characters in the film  craig schwartz finds his ultimate puppet but at what costby the way i loved the film in which john malkovich played a jewel thief my rating  910,black_comedy
puppeteering for craig john cusack is the nearest thing to his hearts desire getting inside another persons skin to animate his soul it doesnt pay well so he fileclerks on floor sevenandahalf of the worlds weirdest office buildingeveryone on this midgetsized floor has to walk around hunched over at the waist craigs wife lotte cameron diaz wants a baby but makes do with babying disturbed chimps and other castoff faunaat the office craig lusts after nononsense maxine catherine keener at the afterofficehours watering hole when he says hes a frustrated puppeteer shes like waiter check please but after behind a file cabinet he discovers a secret portal into the mind of actor john malcovich played by himselfthis is after all a fantasyshe senses a business opportunity they can charge unfulfilled souls 200 to spend 15 minutes in celebrity skin and be spit out safely by the side of the new jersey turnpikeno one is keener to try it than lotte somehow she knows itll be ecstasy and it is she immediately wants to become a transsexual hearing this maxine cool to craig but warm to lotte has a hot flash which stands her nipples at attention shell seduce malcovich while lotte is inside him when lotte digs it and craig finds out craig locks lotte in the chimps cage and unbeknownst to maxine and malcovich replaces her as the third in a unique mnage  troisfrom here the permutations of identify transfer proliferate to the delight of the viewer if not always the onscreen characters the movie creates a brand new form of perversion and then redeems it without giving away the ending it can be revealed that this film extends metaphors of getting inside another personsex identity transfer puppeteeringinto unsuspected avenues of redemption and intimations of both novel and traditional versions of immortality,black_comedy
this movie has to be one of the more bizarre and twisted ive seen in years it has definite comedic elements but isnt really a comedy it has science fiction elements but isnt scifi if you force it into a classification then it must be a dramaall three major cast members turn in very strong performances and the edit work is also excellentin short  make sure youre ready for a big reality twist when you see it also be patient its a hard one to stick with for the first half of the film,black_comedy
does this film look into the relationship between the spectator and the actor  am i reading something into that just isnt there  in other words john cussack and cameron diaz are dowdy  ugly  dissatisfied  bored  yearning but unsuccessful and then they discover somethingsomething that allows them for a short period of time to envelop anothers body another persona  they become happy escaping into the psyche of another human being  whom just so happens to be a famous actor  they feel like they have found themselves during these short periods of time things are safe and exciting all at once  they want to do it again and again  just so they can escape their own sense of humdrum and theres always the middleman willing to take their money aka catherine keener isnt this just like our experience of film and the cinema  dont we go to vicariously live someone elses life for a while  to forget our own ennui  to be john malkovichmaybe im just up my own ae  its just one of the many strands i thought about when watching this movie,black_comedy
when i finally went to see this movie i wasnt aware of the plot and i hadnt read any reviewstherefore it totally and utterly surprised me being the brilliant movie that it isunfortunately im sorry to say it wont be such a surprise for you anymore having read this spoilerreview i think we may have touched on one of the few disadvantages of checking out a movie before you go see it,black_comedy
ultimately not what it could have been  what begins as a fantastical exploration of a warped reality   amazing and engaging in its portrayal of has by the 34 mark run out of gas  the uniqueness of the vision does not sustain a rapidly thinning plot enjoyable nonetheless,black_comedy
superb this film works on so many levels if this rating chart was a marshall amp id crank it all the way up to 11,black_comedy
is like alice in wonderland in reverse  a  puppeteer john cusack discovers a tunnel that leads from his own bizarre existence into the comparatively tranquil world inside the head of actor john malkovich  this is a daring and brilliant movie  it may seem disordered like thousands of little lights flashing at their own whim but is tied together by its main theme and becomes the burst of a single firework delighting the senses  that theme is control control of the puppeteer working the strings that give his wooden dolls movement control of his own life which is quickly eluding him and control of the world he craves through monopolization of the secret tunnel  it is the story of a singularly unique love triangle  because it occurs inside john malkovichs head perhaps it could even be termed a love quadrangle  director spike jonze deserves enormous credit for this achievement  he has molded some marvelous individual talents including cameron diaz orson bean and charlie sheen into an excellent ensemble  must have been a pure joy in which to perform  this film contains perhaps the funniest single moment in movie history,black_comedy
this is the best movie i have seen in a long long time  this movie has so many wondrous levels and it is a delight to watch them all unfoldall of the actorsactresses were perfectly cast  i especially enjoyed the cameo by charlie sheen toward the enddo not take the message of this movie lightly  it will and should move you to question your own consciousness and mortality  the fate of john malkovich almost moved me to tears  his desperate cry for joy im free im free is quickly muffled by the onslaught of unwanted puppeteers without his consciousness or thoughts he does not exist  wow now thats deep folksget off your butt and go rent it now  this is a must see and shouldve been best picture of the year hands down,black_comedy
its a plot outline  there might be a spoilerhas to be one of the mostdifferent films that actually work charlie kaufman deserved an oscar for his screenplay  his ideas were so twisted hilarious and geniusthe parts were well acted the dialogue was very funny begins with a great opening scene  a puppet show john cusack who plays the puppeteer craig schwartz does this amazing realistic puppet show its great then we get to meet cameron diaz his wife and a freaky pet lover that believes her chimp is having mind problems because he is a chimp since craig isnt getting money from the puppet gig hes forced to get workcraig gets work at as a filer at an agency on the seventh and a half floor the secretary he meets is hilarious that scene is a great one at work he meets maxine played by catherine keener who does the most superb work of the year craig starts beginning to like her trying to hit on her but with her btchy attitude it doesnt go wellthen at work craig drops a folder behind the cabinet he moves the cabinet to find a door in the wall its very small he enters and gets sucked through a tunnel then suddenly we are looking through the eyes of john malkovichafter fifteen minutes craig is spontaneously dropped by the side of the new jersey turnpike he goes back to the office to tell maxine  who doesnt believe him then he sends his wife cameron diaz through the tunnel she looks through johns eyeswhile hes in the shower when he comes out she tells her husband that shes thinks she is a transexual maxine develops a plan to make 200 every time someone goes through and it succeeds until john malkovich finds outits a great movie spike jones does a great job directing such a magnificent and surrealistic picture it is one of the best pictures of 1999,black_comedy
this is a completely entertaining interesting and funny film the beginning sets your mood for dry humor mixed with the life observations of puppets and humans relationships  the puppet theme is all over the place and works  the trips into jms mindbody are hilarious and bizarre  if you enjoy dry humor and imaginative storylines with great performances see this film,black_comedy
the thing i noticed about this film the most was its ability to really capture the viewers attention and hold it  i didnt really know much about this film before i saw it it was nothing like i expected  which as it turns out was a good thing  it was really bizarre but very original  i still cant quite believe what i saw  i dont think i have seen john malkovich perform in a role even remotely like this one  he did an absolutely fantastic job playing himself but then not really playing himself in the real world sense  im surprised this film was ever made by a big studio considering its extreme weirdness but it was good  a totally fresh approach to a incredibly new subject matter this film really opens up endless possibilities  in three words  it was great,black_comedy
a man takes a menial job at a mysterious corporation and discovers a means to enter and control the mind of a famous actor  bizarre blend of scifi drama comedy and suspense defies film categorization rating a,black_comedy
well im biased i love everything malkovich does but this is extraordinary its weird its topnotch what a wonderful mix of talent and wackiness and they are all so great how did they get diaz to look that homely how did they get cusack that nerdy how did they get malkovich to make fun of himself like that wonderful everybodys favourite seem to be the malkovich malkovich scene mine is when malkovich is freed from swartz and for a brief moment enjoy a moment of relief before his mind is totally bombarded by an endless stream of seniors you got to see this,black_comedy
imaginative and creative but takes on so much it only skims the surface of the issues raised leaving it a bit flat in the end people desperate to spend 15 minutes in the consciousness of someone famous rather than endure their own assumingly bland existence speaks volumes about lack of self knowledge and development just as desperate to escape a natural part of life death and the mystery that it holds out of fear these people seem to be denying themselves the ultimate portal trip the movie is more thought provoking than funny and i give it 710 for that it pulls off some original scenes as well i cant remember ever seeing anything like the run through malkovichs subconscious well done,black_comedy
this is an inspired twisted movie  the muchtalked about concept where actors actually go inside john malkovich is an excellent twist but would not have worked were the plot and acting not so good in themselvesin truth malkovich is a catalyst for the plot  a weird love triangle occurs between john cusack catherine keener and cameron diaz  instead of the average movie with such a premise where the actors pretty much spend an hour and  a half lamenting their situation the three of them act upon their instincts using a portal in cusacks office they find that takes you into malkovichs headthe wonderful thing about this movie is that it doesnt take itself too seriously   while there is real emotion and tension throughout the movie its mixed in with the weirdness of the whole situation and ends up with a very good balance between the comedic aspects of being able to go inside someones mind and the feeling the characters have for each othera word about the acting everyone is good  cusack and bean play straightmen of sorts and are very good at it  cameron diaz tries to shed her beauty glow and it almost works though at times she tries to hard to seem downbeat  there are two excellent performances one is catherine keener as the vixen who enchants everyone she meets  she plays the part with a real sexual energy you dont often see andjohn malkovich is great  he really plays three characters and plays them all expertly  he is really a comic relief of sorts in this story  he allows the movie to poke all kinds of fun at him and his performance is great  better than the one where he play a jewel thief if that doesnt makes sense see the movieall in all this movie is a real departure from the usual hollywood drivel i highly recommend it,black_comedy
this is a wonderfully innovative and entertaining film  so many films try for that quirky intelligent label and fail miserably so its nice to see one that actually succeeds  is interesting thoughtprovoking and hilarious  i cant think of another film of which i could say the same thing,black_comedy
i once heard someone say that there are ten basic plot lines for films but now there are 11 the 11th being  id agree it certainly is different from anything id seen before  that didnt necessarily translate into a film i thoroughly enjoyed howeveri found the acting lackluster with the exception of malkovich as himself the unwitting participant and was not terribly impressed with spike jonzes directorial debut  with a story the calibre of this one having either of those facets of the picture being particular highquality would have warranted a high rating  as it is i gave the film a 610 based upon the storyline which i found fascinating and malkovichs performance which is a howl,black_comedy
started poorly through my own eyes  the chaos and artificial lighting of the marital home threatened a headache for me and once the floor seven and a half joke had had its moment its claustrophobic feel began to irritate me  then around the time catherine keener appeared the way out became easier  from here on i was gripped  i single ms keener out because a she is devastatingly beautiful but also b it was impossible to relate to the john cusack cameron diaz or john malkovich characters  i should add that this is the result of a fascinating storyline rather than poor acting  ok  ill admit it  it was very very late on that i remembered that cameron diaz was in this film  i may have used this line before but cameron diaz  unattractive  what an actor  top marks this yearits the morning after by now  i feel i need to go back againron,black_comedy
this could have been a great movie but the directors lack of experience shows this is a one gimmick movie that tries desperately to be inventive unfortunately  there are no sympathetic characters in the movie and that really kills it  of course among abundance of inept movies from hollywood this one might look as something different but masterpiece it is not rent it  but dont buy,black_comedy
this movie is really good but i must ask myself if this is really a comedy sure it made me laugh sometimes but most movies do that i rather think of it as a sad drama about human life the characters are searching for two things 1 eternal life 2 being somebody elseso this movie somehow shows us that most people arent happy with their lives in this movie they can be somebody else but how about real life this movie is somewhat to pessimistic in the relation to real life solutions of such problems it just gives us a nonexisting solution this is clearly not a comedy for me but a good movie though,black_comedy
bravo this is a brilliantly original and captivating tale  it creates its own world and thoroughly believes it  cameron diaz is absolutely amazing in it and catherine keenans chemistry with her is sizzling  john cryer makes a great antihero for the piece and malkovich himself is probably the only actor who cold pull it off  he should have won a special oscar for this and what an astoundly perfect use of orson bean  i watched it 3 straight times i was so enfatuated with this truly brilliant piece of work,black_comedy
truly a wonderful idea  but when the audience starts looking at their watches its time to call for the editor im as angry at it as i was at bill clinton very bright but he blew it it could have been a great film perhaps the director will do a reverse speilberg for us do a directors cut that is actually tighter and more disciplined  one that brings all those wonderful ideas together in a more economical fashion strunk and white where were you when we needed you,black_comedy
it makes me so happy to see a film like this attain its own sort of popularity to know there is a significant audience for offbeat fare shining through the oppressive quagmire of blockbusters  praise to everyone involved with this weird yet plausible and not too bizarre to get caught up in filmed story after which you will never look at puppetry the same way again  its basically about people who for some reason or other just cant be themselves either because others wont accept them for that or they cant accept themselves or else well its their job to be someone else  an out of work puppeteer lands what he thinks at first is a normal clerical job discovers by accident a channel into the mind of a notable actor and is coerced by a scheming coworker to sell tickets for the experience  and pays a dear price himself in the process  identity sanity whats it worth to not be you for about 15 minutes just make sure you have a ride back from alongside the jersey turnpike  with another beautiful haunting score by carter burwell of coen bros fame  take a different sort of movie escape and just be glad youre you,black_comedy
but sometimes you just need a very original very different movie like this to wake you up and force you to pay attention to the damn tv or whatever you are watching i personally think that this movie definitly deserved more credit than it gotjhon cusak and csameron diaz pull off a very convincing act of a nerdy weird married couple who are on the verge of driving each other insane all jhon cusak wants is to pursue a carrer of being a pupetter his fingers can work magic but he cant make any money playing with dolls cameron diaz plays the wife of this puppet master shes very dull very boring and would give anything to be someone elsewhen john finds a portal in his office that leads to the mind of john malkavich he relizes that being someone different is the best thing that ever happered to him but the same felling crosses his wifediaz when she tries it john malcovich plays a very impotant part in this very original movie he plays the host of antics founded buy john cusakthis movie diserves alot more credit than it gotthis movie also has a couple scenes with one of my all time faviorite actors charlie sheen,black_comedy
director spike jonzes first fulllength feature is a work of demented genius jonze whose previous work includes the video for fat boy slims praise you and a small role in david russells three kings has created something virtually unique a film far too bizarre to ever get studio interest but with mainstream stars and a worldwide releasecraig schwartz john cusack is a brilliant but pretentious and egotistical puppeteer his frumpy animalobsessed wife lotte cameron diaz looking plain  i told you this was weird urges him to get a proper job which he eventually does sorting files on floor 7  of an office building where the ceiling is so low he is forced to crouch all the time there he meets a very attractive woman catherine keener who isnt at all interested in him until he finds a magical portal into the mind of john malkovich she suggests charging 200 for fifteen minutes in the great mans head after which the passenger is dumped onto the verge by the new jersey turnpiketo explain any more of the increasingly odd plot would only convince you not to watch this film this would be a bad decision as jonze handles the idea by charlie kaufman  arrest this man he must be a danger to society with a deftness that astounds the ridiculous concept is only half of the film  the reactions to the supernatural are the real charm the concept is not clouded by philosophical considerations of self as schwartz naively believes but by love jealousy and greedof course this turns on the central performances malkovich is wonderful as himself and adapts his performance brilliantly as the plot requires cusack bravely loses all attractive character traits to create craig a jealous impotent idiot with ideas above and indeed outside of his head and diaz is equally remarkable as the wacky lotte it is catherine keener however who steals the film with a display of such massive selfishness and egotism that she fully deserved her recent oscar nomination these performances and a host of cameos some less than a second spot winona ryder and jennifer aniston really make a film that is in danger of being a little too weird i have no idea how this got made but thank goodness it did  it waves two fingers at hollywood and runs off giggling,black_comedy
   12     a tough one to rate  the screenplay is extremely creative but to me it tries to hard to cover too much ground too many themes  as entertainment the first half hour is the funniest stuff ive seen in a movie in a long time  but then the unpleasantness of the characters started getting to me and by the end i had to consider it an admirable misfire  john cusack is excellent,black_comedy
first that this film is in the top 250second that this film is viewed as ground breaking in any significant waythird that the us film industry is so devoid of truly good films that this film would be so wellreceived by american audiencesregarding my first statement of disbelief great works like bronenosets potyomkin and rashomon are relegated to lower portions of the top 250 and other greats for vastly divergent reasons like hor m panenko bittere ernte mephisto and le salaire de la peur arent even among the top 250  how can this film which breaks precious new ground be classed above the first two films which have been monumentally important for the development of cinema throughout the whole world  how can this film be called a great social critique when compared to hor m panenko and mephisto  how can it compare to the study of deeply flawed characters found in films like bittere ernte and le salaire de la peur  the answer to all three questions is that it recall cantregarding my second point how is this film ground breaking cutting edge whatever  movies from music video directors arent that rare  obsession with celebrity and the horrors wrought by greed are topics that have been covered extensively in the last fifty years  heck even issues of sexual identity have been covered much better than this  perhaps the only thing that is truly cutting edge in this movie is the fact that it manages to incorporate so many ideas and yet never really fully nurture any of them instead it just rushes away on the next interesting pointregarding my final point what have these people been watching  i regularly watch old and new imports from around the world and a whole heckuva lot of them are much better than this  do these people watch nothing but cynical american tv shows and movies where people dont care at all for each other or anyone just like this movie  you doubt me  well then why are orson bean and crew not debating the moral ramifications of ramming themselves into another mans head for the rest of his liferegardless of these criticisms it remains a good movie 710 but is definitely not top 250 material,black_comedy
was the single funniest most creative and most fascinating movie released in 1999john cusack cameron diaz and catherine keener perform excellently in this wildly original film but john malkovich himself provides the best performance  he somehow acts not as himself but as others see him  its as if he forgets everything he knows about himself and just goes by the stereotype of himself as a creepy villainspike jonze also directs this movie very well and very imaginatively  and how couldnt he  with a plot this brilliant and unique its hard to miss and he pulls it off amazingly  see this movie,black_comedy
if i could summarize what being john malcovich is it would be beautiful the movie tells a story that all of us dream about  being someone else in this movie you can be john malcovich for 15min  throughout the movie we further gain a glimpse into a persons life as he would see it and by doing that we see that there is a certain mystery attatched to john malcovich that everybody sees  the plot has an interesting twist to it the portal was found by a puppeteer who takes control of malcovich in order to have the woman he loves  very beautiful film  i highly recommend it,black_comedy
this movie is probably 2 on my favorite movies list the red violin is 1 is definitely not for everyone  you must be able to relax absorb yourself into the film and enjoy  the bad comments on this film are probably from people who enjoyneed a quick movie with lots of action  this is not that  this film makes you think,black_comedy
for me was a surprisingly good film yes i read the reviews but so many films lately possess great reviews but then when i see the flick i just cant comprehend the praise not this one this movie truly deserves the praise it has been given this film is quirky odd original which is hard to come by unusual strange unnatural yet natural bazaar silly exact and in general a pleasure i was pleased with the direction the acting and most of all the story which never ceased to amaze and always found a new door to crawl through and a new insight always lay at the other end if youre tired of seeing mindless drivel see a film in which even the title character appeared and performed well,black_comedy
warning there are possible spoilers in this comment for the best viewing experience it is best to know nothing about the movie at allthis movie along with having maybe the best and most daring and original plot in the history of hollywood movies also has wonderful colourful human interaction all the characters  and i mean all  are glaringly dysfunctional but they are this in such a way that their defects click together to produce some of the great dialogues in cinema the point where craig tries to explain maxine about just having been inside john malkovichs head is just incredible in its simplicity and effectiveness the interplay between craig and lotte is also crackling this movie also contains one of the weirdest love interests ever  between a quasilesbian domineering woman who is turned on by a woman inside a mans body and a bored housewife who experiences the thrill of being inside john malkovich and decides shes a transsexual thus lines like i have to see you maxine  ok lotte ill see you in malkovich in an hour are born wonderful wonderful movie see it with an open mind but not so open as to let john cusack get in through a muddy tunnel,black_comedy
what makes this movie so much fun is how outlandish it is but at the same time it sucks you into accepting the ridiculous as a plausible reality there are so many new and different subplots that i was blown away that they should all appear in just one film i have recently thought that everything that could be a film plot had been done     i was way wrong      one of the best films ive ever seen,black_comedy
what should i say about this movie at first the appearances of the actors were brilliant especially cameron diaz did very well as lotti the idea of the movie was also absolutely unique and strange but i think the movie was not worth all that it had its really funny and witty moments charlie sheen but all in all it was just too boring perhaps i didnt get the meaning of this movie if anyone did please mail me,black_comedy
and it would be a perfect film were it not in the end asimple comedy  i love a good comedy  and this fits the billamongst the best but it could have been more  there aredeeper issues that could have been explored and discovered better than they were  ideas regarding expression behavior and control were never brought intofocusregardless of this it is still a 910 movie  it is bizarre andfunny  one would half expect it to be a terry gilliam filmalong the lines of brazil  a wonderful if ultimatelylightweight film,black_comedy
i looked at the timer on the vcr  it was at 14 minutes  i had just stopped laughing virtually continuously from the beginning of the movie took a breather then laughed some more this is hands down one of the most original and hysterical movies ive ever seen  from the seven and a half floor what an idea to dr lesters secretary i barely survived the first half hour then it just got better if you are a movie fan you must see this movie  cant go on about it enough,black_comedy
is this a film  or an experience actually what is it and which planet did it come from subverting this and several other art forms jonzes thing  i cant call it a film  is so far out of left field its on a different pitch altogether my girlfriend laughed like a drain but i just sat openjawed all the way through what are we supposed to make of it does it matter jonze himself when pressed on the films meaning shrugs and says i dunno perhaps thats a good thing bjm needs to stand on its own without even the influence of its creator creator was this thing created or did it just appear from some other dimension warped into our own by some peculiar combination of cosmic elements this sounds like a negative review but i loved it its just hard to describe an experience which is unlike any other youve ever had leave your expectations at the door before seeing this one because theyll only hinder you if this is what 21st century cinema is going to be like i want in 10 out of 10 and full marks to the team behind itmalkovich malkovich,black_comedy
well the story repeats herself once again last year this happened to the unforgetable the truman show and this year to probably the best film directorial debut for a video commercial director what both films have in common is a unique originality unpredictability and involving seductive irresistible subliminal monsterous tone that spoke of big issues in an unrepeatably subtle and yet direct wayobviously they werent long enough or something for the academys taste i hold that they both deserved the academy award for best picture because that is i think the only way american movies have a bright future  if awarding ultraoriginal creations magnificantly and spectaculary constructed uniquely written and powerfully and impressively performed and thats exactly what the truman show and especially arecharlie kaufmans screenplay has enough originalities for two dozen other movies but togather with director spike jonzes certainty they reveal them slowly and neatly always in a wellargumented manner and with good balance the plot keeps surprising you from the beggining to the end never going over the top or losing its directionits hard for me to even imagine how much effort the creators had to put into making this movie and how hard it was to write it in the first place and then edit all that rough material at the end i cant remember them failing anywhere which is very rare in american filmmaking in general nowadays and when it even happens in a movie like this its a miraclethis movie is even so endlessly inventive and unpredictable it kept surprising me even more in the last quarter than in the first or the second one or the third one  maybe the most original one and when even that happens and when its not done in a oneinventionontopoftheotherwithabsolutelynoorderorreason manner like it isnt here then you have a great motion picturetalks wisely funny and instructively about a lot of subjects that all come from the one in title and the message is that they should not jonze managed to devise a very specific strange atmosphere that he drags throughout the movie and adapts it to the situations the result is one of the most stirring movies ive seen in the last few yearsan endless number of words could be spilled out about this film not one could describe how good it was to me and how truly entertaining it is maybe its not as emotionally moving as his last years partner in pain the truman show both of the movies received best director and best original screenplay nomination and were deprived for acting nomination  carrey last year malkovich here but it probably is even a little better performed and better balanced or editedboth of them were best pictures of the years they were released in but obviously not long enough,black_comedy
i saw this movie twice on board a singapore airlines flight from australia to manilla via singapore they had to ply me from the seat to stop me watching this great movie a third time you must see this movie,black_comedy
i went to see with high expectations but came out of the theater somewhat let down the film has a great premise good actors and its full of original ideas and intelligent twists even bigger the disappointment when after the first half the film loses its thematic integrity turning into a conceptual merrygoround without a proper focus on anythingas said before the first half of is ingenious although based on an extxraordinary idea the film doesnt just play with it but instead uses it to explore themes such as identity manipulation and celebrity strangely much of this is thrown into the trashcan after we hear the explanation why there is a portal into malkovichs mind in my opinion there was no need for explanation and the one given was stupid and incoherent after that the film is nothing more than a battle of who controls john malkovich it suffers the fate it kept avoiding for its first half the last 30 minutes of the film are nothing more than an intellectual masturbation with no direction nor deeper meaning the ending albeit strange is unsatisfying and does little to save the moviea minor letdown is john cusack his literary lines and overthetop acting would work well if were just a comedy but when he tries to play the tragic character and display inner conflicts he simply isnt credible this is hardly cusacks fault though the dialogue the characters and their emotional reactions are not crafted in a believable way the only exception himself whether this is deliberate or not it ruins much of the films dramatic tensiondespite all this criticism i still kind of liked mainly for its clever themes and original way of approaching them if american cinema is going into this direction im not complainingrating  out of ,black_comedy
it has been years since we the moviegoing public has seen a year as filled with great cinema as 1999  first the matrix then the sixth sense the cartoon the iron giant my favorite movie of all time american beauty the raging fight club and now  never have i seen such a creative concept for a movie  and the entire series of plot twists that make the entire movie one huge jumble of plots and stories  and right at the center is john horatio malkovichthe story is so original and absurd it is hard to believe anyone could think of it  a puppeteerfile clerk finds a doorway into john malkovichs head in which you can see the world through john malkovichs eyes for fifteen minutes  the clerk teams up with a beautiful coworker who his wife ends up falling in love with  and the coworker loves the wifewhen the wife is inside of john malkovich  saying anymore would wreck the movie experience but there is one scene with the million malkoviches that blew me away10 out of ten,black_comedy
i just saw this movie tonight and it was phenomenal it was such an incredible directorial debut by spike jonze and the acting was terrific but best of all was the screenwriting the movie had me in stitches the whole time it was so humorous and had so many excellent twists and turns a great script pieced everything together with hilarity and the ending to this wonderfully obscure film was amazing,black_comedy
good solid heartfelt laughter is not something that i get to enjoy very often   i knew very little of the story of this movie and i relied more on cast composition production team and suggestions from a few industry related friends when i chose to go seeafter viewing the movie i read many reviews and i realized that was i to watch it now they were depriving me of many punchlinesi will hence not tell you anything of the movie except for the fact that for once you will have a chance to see a film and not feel like you are being treated like a child to whom everything must be explainedtrust me watch this movie if you like to laugh and if you are disappointed then you can email me and tell me all about it i am not expecting much mail,black_comedy
for those who want their reviews as thumbs upthumbs down see it this movie is stranger than you think funnier than you might imagine and actually somewhat troubling its a bizarre fairy tale a twisted fantasy and a warped love story its directed by a former skateboard cameraman who went mainstream first with music videos beastie boys sabotage and commercials the one i recall involves doctors the song tainted love and an ekgi should warn you that i walked into this movie tremendously excited and enthusiastic its set in new york city and prominently features a bit of the new jersey turnpike that i know well better i got free passes yet usa films has in no obvious other way bought me out and any ebulence i show is strictly coincidental heck they didnt even give me a movie poster or a john malkovitch mask so im sort of resentfulthe movie has two trailers in one we hear the soundtrack to fast cheap and out of control while steven hawkings voice explains that humans are vessels for something else in the other john cusack asks for the seven and a halfth floor and the lady with him jams down the stop button and crowbars open the elevator clearly shes done this before and the elevator shows the damage that trailer is set to the song brazil from the movie brazilthose alone sold me on the filmsee john cusack out of a suit for the first time in his life watch abelard and heloise the puppet show with incredible marionettes watch john malkovitch play john cusack playing a geek see deep into john malkovitchs subconsious,black_comedy
i really liked this movie  all of the comedy is really irreverent but it fits so well into the story  spike jonze finally stops directing music videos and has come up with a gem  cusack is great as a puppeteer who finds a portal into john malkovichs head  the reason this movie struck me as so funny i think is because malkovich does not take himself seriously but at the same time plays the role with real sincerity  a novel idea and a great effort  unlike the truman show which was also a great idea but which didnt come off very well  this movie is as weird as it seems,black_comedy
i just saw and i was blown away by the idea of the story but i wish there was a bit more adventurefantasy here and less of the relationships of the characters but it was still good 7510,black_comedy
people say you either love or hate this film but as far as i can see its not interesting enough to warrant either feeling from me rarely have i seen a film that has received such high accolades from reviewers that in reality is only average and mildly entertaining i wondered if i had just watched the same film as everyone else from the underdeveloped and miscast 2dimensional characters particularly catherine keener  john cusack to the tasteless and pointless lesbian love triangle subplot there was simply too many flaws in a film that had so much potential bjm could have been an intriguing insight into the subconscious of the human mind and an analysis of human psyche but falls short on both counts i can only wonder what this film could have been in the hands of a genuine director as opposed to an amateur music video director like spike jonz i wanted to like this film just as so many who found malkovich lacking as it stands its nothing more than average entertainment for the everyday masses score 410,black_comedy
this movie is fresh and funny you forget everything when you sit and start seeing it i wish i could meet the director and also the actors to realize maybe that it is just a movie and that the caracters dont really exist otherwise i just get mad and think that there is a 7 12 floor somewhere in ny,black_comedy
in a year of great movies this was my personal favorite  very original smart and hip  all without playing any cheap tricks on the audience  one complaint about 13 of the way through the lighting becomes very dark and stays that way for some time  this made me drowsy  the first time i saw it i did not understand the end my own fault  but the second time i got it  when they are reading the book about portals in the mind it says a person entering a fetus mind will be trapped inside it forever  cusack had left malkovich then reentered the portal just after 1200 after which the portal had stopped going to malkovich and redirected itself into the fetus of his daughter and of course he had no way to know this would happen very clever  i recommend multiple viewings as things take on a different meaning the next time around  great music great acting great story lots of laughs and a good amount of absorbing moments gives this one a 1010,black_comedy
a great comedy that is an antidote to the recent wave of boring and formulaic comedies that have infected hollywood original magicrealism very well written and performed with spoton timing cusak is great and of course so is malkovich the only fault of the film is technical the camera work was a little too shakey and way too many closeups for my tastes and i found it poorly lit for reasons not well known however well worth paying full price for a definite mustsee spike jonez will be worth keeping an eye on i would highly recommend the films schizopolis and celestial clockwork to everyone who enjoyed this movie both of which are quite similar in style to bjm both 1990s  comedies  that explore the magic realist  surrealist  dadaist genres,black_comedy
probably everyones mentioned this but this is the kind of movie that could only come out of the buddy holly video itself  i dont think ive had this much fun in a long time and thats not a bad thing  this is probably the only entertaining movie ive seen this year that happened to also set it for me and stand outyeah yeah yeah american beauty was funny and gorgeously filmed but too easy all at the same time that it felt like accessible intelligence for the masses or something  whereas this movie doesnt require you try to pretend youre seeing some honest portrayal of americans  you just know it is but would rather say it was the most hilarious film,black_comedy
i cant understand why this beautiful movie is cashing so little at the box office story is very original and full of new ideas acting is very good time runs fast with a lot of fun everything is genially my only suggest is this go and watch you will remain satisfied for sure if you already watched the matrixamerican beautyfight club you dont get nothing else to watch which is good like being j malkovich maybe the title is ugly and does not reflect the soul of this movie but if you wasted seven dollar watching a garbage like   you could spent one million to watch a real cameo like this fantastic film im not a jmalkovich friend or something like miro viglianesi,black_comedy
in this day and age its hard to find a movie that truly is something that youve never seen before is that moviea very bizarre visual trip put on film odd characters odd settings an odd plot just a damn odd movievery surreal and enjoyable it was definitly worth the price of admission,black_comedy
after leaving the theater i was not only deeply engrossed in the creepy feeling of the over all concept but also wanting to view the film again simply of the astounding puppeteer work  i found this film struck an excellent balance between comedyfantasy and realistic introspectioni dont know how long it will take me to get the image of when john m enters his own portal out of my subconsciousi highly recommend this film for those who enjoy fantasy with a dark realistic edge,black_comedy
i went to see this movie at the recommendation of a friend after coming out of the theater my friend and i both agreed that this movie was very strange although it was strange this movie is one of the few films i have seen that really makes you think the story takes a number of intriguing twists and turns john cusack turns in a great performance as an obscure and confused man cameron diaz is almost unrecognizable in comparison to her other roles if you like to think and be challenged at the movies this film is for you if youre are looking for mindless entertainment stay home,black_comedy
is a superb film  the twists in the movie and the oddball humor is original and inventive  everything fits perfectly together in the ending  cameron diaz deserves an oscar for her zany offthewall performance,black_comedy
was one of the best movies ive seen this year  with spike jonze the most awesome director of the decade behind it i knew it had to be at least original  but after seeing it i was like whoa this is awesome  good plot good acting especially by my main man john cusak and also a breakout hottiecatherine keener  rowwwwwwr where did she come from  i saw her in living in oblivion like 4 years ago but she wasnt as fine as she is now  gdamn  okay off subject  anyway i highly suggest seeing this movie you wont be disappointed  if you are then youre basically admitting your iq is lower than 70 points,black_comedy
i cant imagine how anyone could not like this movie there are a few type of people that wont like it  people who question everything  why water is flourinated why we still use glass bottles etc  malcontents  people that can walk outside on a warm sunny day and honestly say that the weather is bad  people that analyze everything you wont like this movie if you think that you can reveal someones innermost thoughts by examining what they ate for lunchdont expect to find any deep hidden meaning from this movie it will not reveal the meaning of life it will not touch on the philosophical issues of the plot watch it to be entertained dont analyze the characters to death accept what is presented and the plot works out fineim not saying this film is the best every made just that it is entertaining and nothing more this film doesnt fit into any genre its mainly comedy and drama but excels at neither and that is the main problem although irrelevent to the enjoyment of the movie of this filmif you want to be entertained dont let the naysayers scare you away from this movie if you want to analyze stuff and look for deeper meanings in the plot go read a good book heart of darkness by conrad will keep you up for nights,black_comedy
i enjoyed the film and laughed out loud many times  although it is a dark comedy it would have worked better for me if the cinematography and lighting had been more true to life there is some great work done by john malkovich  not since steve martin in all of me has an actor done so well sharing his body,black_comedy
a friend once told me of an exotic menu item at a foreign restaurant which was simply listed as the item which cannot be described that is the only way i can describe this film the trailer intrigued me when i first saw it but so many films fail to live up to the trailer  especially a trailer as surreally loopy as this yet somehow this movie manages to live up to its tease by now youve probably heard lots of buzz about this movie i will not even attempt to describe it except to say that however jaded you may be  you have never seen anything quite like this like it or hate it though i cant see how you will not be bored i pity the writer  director having to top this in their next project,black_comedy
its impossible to me to understand why a very very very good movie like this is cashing so little at the box office i presume that the title is wrong it should be better seven floors and half i also presume that the  look of j cusack  cameron diaz has been another wrong third wrong too few advertising we have to remember that an ugly movie like blair witch cashed a lot just for a perfect publicity i hope that producers will give another chance to s jonz who created one of the best movie of the year i loved this movie miro viglianesi,black_comedy
i dont know what to say except wow  this movie is so different than the typical hollywood fare and so much better  this movie is well written well acted well directed this has been one of the most entertaining moviegoing experiences i have had in quite a long time  wow,black_comedy
we finally got to a couple of weeks after it was released and am i glad we did  it was extremely creativebrilliant in places  but what an odd story with some very odd people  getting inside the head of jm for 15 minutes a takeoff on andy warhols 15 minutes of fame only to be dumped out of the air by the side of the new jersey turnpike  who came up with that  cameron diaz as a frumpy  animal lover john cusack as a puppeteer and john malkovich making such fun of himself while playing himself  the best scene was when jm went inside his own brain  what do you think you would see  plenty of places in this film to laugh out loud  look for a couple of nominees on oscar nightnote  believe the r rating for your kids we almost took our 14yr old until i read the reviews glad we opted not to  odd sexual situations that you would not enjoy with a kid in tow,black_comedy
arguably i think it is though everyone is probably going to sniff at the absurdity and cynicism of you have to agree that you have never seen anything like it not even closethis story is mostly about manipulation and identity crisis and it has so much symbolism of that john cusack is a puppeteer a very skilled one at that who likes the creations that dangle from strings under his fingers he is the starving and depressed artist of his craft and has his puppets which represent real people in his life carry out his emotions and fantasieseven the use of john malkovich an excellent character actor seems to be a perfect choice in this movie of being someone else if even for 15 minutes of fame perhaps i truly believe john malkovich deserves an academy award for best supporting actor not only for his magnificent performance but for having the guts of playing himself and revealing a twisted if fictional subconscience one of the funniest jokes in the film is that no one knows what movie hes been in i loved you in that jewel thief moviecharlie kaufman deserves some kind of award for his ingenious script spike jonze puts kaufmans vision on film with such visual pizazz umm im coming short of intelligent words to define this film just see it because everyone shines every sight gag is hysterical the wacky and witty dialogue is sweet music to the ears this movie is phenomonalits been getting as much raves and hype as the blair witch project but unlike that cinematic ripoff this movie certainly deserves it all of it and as a fan of spike jonzes music videos i cannot wait to see what feature film he comes up with next the same with kaufmans creative genious,black_comedy
i couldnt give the movie a rating as high as a 9 or 10 but i felt it was a very strong eight  its the most original movie made in the us in many years and along with american beauty also one of the years best movies the film should make a star out of catherine keener cameron diaz underplaying her part is sweet and adorable as alwaysthe highpoint of the film is her chasing after keener near the end of the movie it is surprising to see this movie get the wide distribution that it has malkovich himself is also very funny  especially when he gets on line to tour himself its a good movie now and will be an excellent video rental in the fu,black_comedy
this film is as much fun as one can have in a theatre without getting arrested  clever sarcastic  bold bjm is loaded with twists and turns that are commonplace in  student films but are pulled off here with professionalism irony and grace  worth the price of admission and several screenings more,black_comedy
this revises my previous review 14nov99 54 in the comments indexfew who see this movie can ever forget it its so original and creative so well acted by a marvelous cast and its so funnybut this is a movie that needs to be seen a second time in a first viewing youre so busy hanging on to the roller coaster  sort of like an action film eg romancing the stone minus the threats of danger to the characters  that you miss its deeper meaning the two levels complement each other and make each the richerat the first most obvious level this movie is for enjoying rather than stating philosophical issues but along the way while it provides few satisfactory answers it does raise some intriguing questions  do we feel that wed be more fulfilled as someone else maybe someone famous than as ourselves  whats the difference and whats appealing between men and womens sexual experience would some women enjoy or envy mens faster arousal  would some men like their sexual experience feminized  whats it like to be a movie star  whats the source of those various conflicting urges we sometimes feel within us could we say they come from the prompting of others voicesurges within us but the most insistent question for most of the characters is how they can feel most selfactualized and they try to find an answer not in being really themselves but rather as puppeteers who pull someone elses stringsand at this first level the characters quests are just material for the fun plot but dont look for thorough consistencies eg maxines early frank sexual opportunism predation vs her later stance or aspects of the craig  lotte relationship in its earlier vs later stages and dont look for deep answers just enjoy the most original creative ride in movies for some yearsthe second deeper level becomes clearer with a second viewing in a sense its very much an insiders joke about directors directing and making movies the beautiful stunning scenes we see early in the film of lifeless wooden puppets becoming so brimming with life movement and feeling these state spike jonzes love and homage to his craft  who wouldnt want to do this these scenes ask and make ideas and people come so alive the film director is metaphorically a puppeteer who brings out of hisher marionetteactors new lives into new roles its the high from this experience that lotte craves when she announces she wants a sex change operation the sex of the first level is a metaphor for creativity at this second level and after making a film is over after the high of making a vision come alive its like being dumped into the banal the prosaic the commonplace  almost like being dropped beside the new jersey turnpike after having lived in the magic of ozbut there are problems that any director puppeteer faces being creative and talented is no fun unless theres an appreciative audience that makes fame and box office valuable and worth pursuing because it gives more avenues and freedom and while a puppeteer has the advantage of owning the actors the marionettes any one director has many competitors wanting to occupy the chosen actors and invest them with hisher vision and theres always another director puppeteer waiting to grab themand the role of maxine i think i understand how this fits with the various people involved with making films  but youll want something to also figure out at this second level dont youi very much appreciate robert lessers review 51 in the comments index qv we share similar views and seeing his comments supported the thinking expressed here,black_comedy
bizarre brilliant wonderful one the finest movies of the yearit gave me the good feelings in my tummy and in my head john malkovich have just hit a career peak playinghimself  wonderfully imaginative and surreal not to mention at times terrifying this is one of those rare films that can be overanalysed to pieces and then chopped up even more after your done spike jonze needs to stick to the movies because he is a true expert in the visual craft a protege of terry gilliam not his films but his monty python animations translated brazil meets seconds meets the subconsious translation of those two and then some,black_comedy
not being a fan of cusack diaz and malkovich i was stunned at talent in this movie  spike jonze is owed a lot of credit as is malkovich for taking a very risky role  see this movie,black_comedy
this film breaks down any and all remaining barriers of film  why  not necessarily because its a good movie its only average but because its so original  ten years ago this would have never been made  five years ago same thing  today though in our everchanging film world if you want to make a portal into john malkovichs brain whos stopping you this film enables a new era of creativity in cinema  whatever you want to do you can  and people will see it  malkovich is pulling in rave reviews and great box office for a small film such as itself  get ready for many more to come,black_comedy
john malkovich got me laughing in the first 15 minutes because of the groeningstyle humor and kept me laughing with the uncomfortable though humorous situations the movie presents with people experiencing john malkovichs life  to me people falling from the sky and landing by the nj turnpike never gets old  an excellent movie that had me wondering if people could be me and what they would find outoh and keener reminded me of the quintessential manipulative woman shes a riot when paired with diaz,black_comedy
a black comedy about not being yourselfwhat could be more said about our own society and the dictation of our culture  everyone wishes at some random moment that they could be someone else  its a given  well this films pokes fun at making you think that maybe that is a way of being happy but if you watch the film close enough no one is really happy being john malchovich not even himself i personally loved every aspect of this film from dull look of craig and lotis home life to the intense cat and mouse chase through the subconscience of a human being  completely new the acting took me for spins which i really like and i finally i couldnt help but think about terry gilliam for some reason  i saw a lot of strageness that i expect in a terry gilliam film but i think spike jonze has his own vision which is really refreshing if you want a recommendation to see this make sure you can laugh at odd little occurrences and that you enjoy offbeat hyperactivity because this film delivers just that,black_comedy
this movie was an amazing experience  alternately hilarious perplexing dazzling disturbing surreal moving and intellectually engaging frequently several of these within one scene  i dont know how to describe the plot beyond the bits you no doubt have heard in the press but i can say that it will take you through an amazing journey in two hours the superb script challenges your notions of free will sense of self and control  but without seeming preachy or philosophically dry  i am amazed that director spike jonze has created such a complex and layered work  but one which is internally consistent  in his first work that runs over 4 minutes  the main themes are echoed throughout the film and by each of the main characters  for example the idea of control is taken up with manipulative sociopathic woman who views people as mere instruments to satisfy her desires several characters who attempt varying degrees of emotional control over their partners and in the actual and metaphorical puppet masters at work in the filmit is interesting to note that jonze and writer charlie kaufmann make light of the philosophical dimension to the film by having john cusacks befuddled character give a confused take on the metaphysical implications of his first experience early in the film  in a way this sets the tone for the film as its creators say this is serious stuff but dont take us too seriously  i encourage everyone to seek out and enjoy the richness of this film,black_comedy
this movie is a refreshing change to what comedies have become so many comedies use the slapstick or toilet humor to get laughs uses a tremendous cast to get laughs from a fairly disturbing story line it uses one of the best actors of the late 20th century and puts him on display for anyone who wants to be him the script is truly original and left the theater with a refreshing glimpse into true comedic genius,black_comedy
was one of the most entertaining movies i have seen this year  it is definitely in a category of its own  i dont know how i would explain it to someone else but it made me laugh a lot  there was a weird approach to the movie and i had this weird feeling throughout the whole movie but it was a comfortable feeling  go see it,black_comedy
foregoing my usual threeparagraph summation all i can say is wow is exquisitely controlled madness this film has several layers of discussionworthy material beyond that of even fight club waxes hypnotic on personal identity celebrity control and so much more in so completely an original and entertaining manner that its skill somewhat masks the sad and depressing conclusions it makes come hollywood pageant time if the academy does not nominate this for film for the oscar complete and utter cynicism has yet another reason for being910 stars,black_comedy
the first time i saw a trailer for this movie i knew it was going to be something special  the film itself is nothing short of brilliant  its fresh funny surreal appealing and intelligent  in a day when the biggrossing comedies are more likely to be gross than big this is a welcome changejohn cusak is really marvelous in that instead of his usual clipped and polished look he is bedraggled and pathetic but retains his appeal catherine keener gives a wonderful comic performance using throwaway lines and even the odd gesture to pull bellylaughs out of the audience  john malkovitch is a great sport willing even to poke fun at the fact that while he is a superb actor hes not all that well knownthe stars of this movie though are the director and the screenwriter ive always thought that the stage was a better medium than film for the truly surreal because in the theatre actors can rely more on the participation of the audience to fill in the blanks film is a much more literal medium so the burden is on the director to present an image that answers questions as quickly as they are posedjonze transcends this convention allowing the actors to tell a rather bizarre story while demanding that the audience pull its own weight  i was totally drawn in and i loved every minute of it  usually a story this unconventional requires a lot of special effects to be credible but here they are at a minimum  almost anyone these days can make a fantasy film out of digital artistry expensive sets and bad acting but it takes a great director and a stellar cast to make a firstrate fable with just actors and a camera,black_comedy
it wasnt much more than a quirky little film was very surprised with an original well written movie i laughed the entire time and john m was not only his usual stunning self but evidently has a great ability to laugh at himself as welldefinite recommend  i dont think anyone that sees this will be sorry they spend the 850,black_comedy
this film shows that independence is alive and well and that top hollywood acting talent is willing to work for way less than asking price to be involved with material of originalitytrying to define the genre of this pic is tantamount to trying to step on the same piece of water twice  the closest one could come is to probably say black comedy since there are some seriously funny scenes that play through the malaise of certain key characters casting is flawless with cameron diaz made up to be about as unattractive as she possibly could orson bean who hasnt been seen on a multiplex screen for going on a decade in a role originally set to be the devil is brilliantattempting to read symbolism into the outlandish particulars of the characters journey is sheer folly  suspension of disbelief needs to be the dominant sensibility for viewing this film considering the many lapses in justified plot elements and character motivations  once youve left your logic behind you can sit back and enjoy a movie that will afford a great aftermovie dinner conversation thats sure to be as stimulating as a trip into the subconscious of mr malkovich,black_comedy

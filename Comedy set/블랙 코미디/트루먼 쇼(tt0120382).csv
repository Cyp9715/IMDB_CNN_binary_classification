epitomizes strong and original storytelling on screen this film is emotionally engaging didactic witty dramatic and very unique for those unfamiliar with the concept truman burbank has never left his ideal home town of sea haven what he doesnt know is that his entire environment is a materialized set and he is the ignorant star of a reality tv show of epic proportionstaking this entirely original concept writer andrew niccol and director peter wier take the viewer into territory uncharted by anything in film history thus the plot is entirely unpredictable but still flows along expertly the tightness of the screenplay and the immaculate pacing of peter wier contribute largely to this films brilliancethe acting performances are amongst the best ive ever seen jim carey is superb as truman effortlessly conveying his fears desires and personality ed harris is excellent as the reclusive creator of the production in addition the entire support cast appears synthetic enough to let the audience know they are acting for truman but in some scenes let their genuine feelings shine through the ensemble simply cannot be faulted carey was hardly done by not to get an oscar nomination for his performancethe music and visuals are top notch the cinematography has a reality tv feel that is clever but never intrusive the shot selection is of the highest quality particularly in the movies final sequence muscially this film is incredible phillip glass is a dream on the piano perfectly evoking the mood for each section of the narrative the two combine excellently during the scene in which truman breaks his routine for the first time during the sequence truman makes subtle changes to the bland routine he follows compliantly every day the emotion of the music when combined with the apparent simplicity of trumans actions makes this scene one the most powerful iv ever experiencedthis film is an absolute gem it effortlessly combines everything a classic film should have it has comedy drama strong character development atmosphere originality superb visuals a superb score tight writing raises interesting moral questions as well as providing insight into the human condition one cannot watch this spectacular film without wondering how a human would react when put in that kind of situation it touches on our sense of adventure desire for conformity and the courage we require to question the life we are presented with does all this in the most accessible and compelling fashion one of the greatest films of our time,black_comedy
truman burbank is an ordinary guy in an ordinary little seaside town of seahaven island where nothing really happens everything is clean everything is perfect he knows people but never really connects to anyone the one woman he ever really loved is not his wife and has long since left for the other side of the world where he longs to visit but feels he can never go paralysed by his fear of water since seeing his father die on a boating accident truman still feels he is missing something a strange light falling from the sky a man who reminds him of his dead father a strange radio broadcast and the feeling that the world really stops when he shuts his eyes all combine to make him feel something is wrong  but what is it that he seeks but feels he cannot findwhen i first saw this film it was with my girlfriend who would then become my wife then exwife and i remember how she and our friends felt a little bit cheated by the film that they had expected to be yet another wacky jim carrey comedy in fairness to her and the others it was easy to do this at the time  who would have thought that jim carrey would be able to act  certainly not the marketing department that sold this film on the basis of it being a hilarious film as opposed to the thoughtful and rewarding film it turned out to be the plot can be viewed on so many levels that it is honestly easier to leave it to each viewer to take what they will from it on the most obvious level it satirises the media the emotional faade of television and the increasingly relevant look at reality shows to others it will say as much about god the empty drone of life and the things that we all desire of course to others it will just be a comedy with general comments to make  and there is nothing wrong with that whatsoever in fact the multilevel approach works to make it appeal to many audiencesstarting as a comedy i am always taken by how well the film moves to become more and more interesting but yet never loses sight of those audience members who have come for the basic story hence it delivers an enjoyable and engaging central narrative that plainly put makes for a comic and involving yarn  we grow to care for truman and this makes the ending an emotional and satisfying one even if some viewers will bemoan the fact that to them it appears open ended that it is also a very thoughtprovoking affair is only a bonus with the satire working on many levels of course by seeming to tackle so many subjects and issues in such a short running time the film never really gets its teeth deep into any one of them but this is not a major problem because it leaves us to do that in our heads after the film finishesthe cast is roundly superb even if the majority of them are in minor roles of course it is easy now to look back at carrey and accept that he can act straight but at the time it seemed so unlikely and few felt it was a good casting choice of course seeing the end result it is clear that he can and he delivers such a great performance that he really makes the film workhe is comic but yet serious sympathetic but not worthy of pity  it is a great delivery and one that basically meant that i now look at his ace ventura stuff as the other category and see his acting as his real work 6 years ago that was vice versa carrey carries the film being on screen for almost the entire film but he has good support from linney emmerich krause and others who play it well despite being stuck in the necessary stiff and unreal roles the controller etc roles are all well played and feature a collection of well known faces including a great support role from harris through to roles for giamatti shearer baker hall and a few others it may be carreys show but the support certainly helpsoverall this is a great film that can be appreciated as much for what it is on the surface a great little comic story as it can for the issues that it hints at all the time there was a time when some viewers may have looked to a carrey film to be a load of mugging an crude basic laughs but this was the film that saw that change thought provoking funny entertaining short enjoyable and well acted throughout  well worth seeing and well worth coming back to several times,black_comedy
i asked a friend to describe  he said no its not a comedy wellnot exactly  i didnt quite understand until i watched it myself  truman takes on a tone quite different than any parodycomedies ive seen lately  the point the media and its destructive powers  is subtlely relayed through dark humor and you dont feel like the director is smashing you over the head with his morals  peter weir demonstrated his artistic genius in dead poets society and here as well the soundtrack is great ed harris is stellar what were they thinking at the academy and for once i actually liked jim carrey his performance wasnt ribald for once the final scenei will not reveal itis a majestic longawaited finish to an intellectual movie some people will insist that it was boring or pointless  those are the same viewers who prefer slapstick obvious humor to the subtle layers presented here  this is a thinking persons movie  if you cant see the underlying message here of course you wont like it,black_comedy
when i first saw i came out of the theatre amazed this is your first clue that you are watching something different from your normal jim carrey movie i love the dialogue camera shot performances direction music and running time of this movie there is nothing i would do to change it i came away from feeling inspired which is the goal of good filmmaking jim carrey was outstanding as truman underplaying him not making him too comic or too dramatic but giving true sincerity when asked he deserved an oscar nomination ed harris has always been a good actor but in this movie hes a great actor he plays christof with such arrogance and bullheadedness that you dont know whether hes helping or destroying truman he and the director peter weir deserved their oscar nodsweir who directed the great witness uses different camera angles to make you feel like youre actually watching and not a movie he ends it before you get tired of the concept and helped carrey and harris give immaculate performances andrew niccol script is a real star in the movie too because of its inventiveness and ingenuity overall is what i like to call a true american classic,black_comedy
life is starting to imitate satire was only made seven years ago but it predates the current mania for socalled reality television shows such as big brother the idea behind such shows is that they present the viewer with a slice of actual reality real people in real situations with real emotions rather than the simulated reality of drama or the edited reality of documentaries the flaw in this idea is that nothing is more unreal than a reality show the presence of the cameras has a distorting effect inducing artificial behaviour patterns in those who appear in front of it and the sort of people who star in such programmes are almost invariably eccentric exhibitionists takes the central concept of reality tv shows one stage further in order to overcome this flaw what would happen if we made a reality programme about a person who has absolutely no idea that he is appearing on television truman burbank is an insurance executive living in a small american seaside town called seahaven and happily married to a nurse named meryl or at least he thinks he is what truman doesnt know is that he is the central character in a soap opera and that his whole life is a fiction the company he works for does not exist seahaven the island it stands on and the surrounding ocean are all part of a gigantic set specially created for the programme and sealed off from the outside world in a gigantic geodesic dome everyone in trumans life meryl his mother his colleagues at work his best friend marlon are actors playing out their roles in his dramafor thirty years truman has accepted his world unquestioningly but at the beginning of the film a series of incidents a light falling from the sky the reappearance of his father who was supposed to have drowned in a boating accident when truman was a boy strange messages picked up on his car radio awaken his doubts although members of the cast make strenuous attempts to dissuade him he decides to try and explore the world outside seahaven in particular he wants to travel to fiji where he has been told that his former girlfriend sylvia now lives sylvia was written out of the show when the scriptwriters decided that he should marry meryl insteadthe film has certain similarities with another film from the late nineties pleasantville which dealt with an inverted version of the same idea two teenagers from the real world are magically transported into the world of a fifties television show in my view however is the better of the two pleasantville deals with its political themes in a heavyhanded way with some very obvious symbolism although it deals with some weighty issues is never ponderous or excessively serious indeed it is often very humorous the main source of humour is the contrast between the nave trusting truman and the behaviour of those around him all living a lie and desperately trying to prevent truman from finding out that it is a lie i had previously thought of jim carrey as a rather annoying actor whose appeal was based upon the idea that manic overacting is in itself funny but here as truman he is very good indeed both amusing and touching i was also impressed by ed harris as christof the shows enigmatic produceranother factor in the success of the film is its visual look seahaven like the town in pleasantville appears as an eerily perfect notquitereal version of the typical american small town but was actually filmed in a real place the purposebuilt village of seaside florida there are similarities with the cult british sixties television series the prisoner which was also filmed in an eerily perfect seaside village portmeirion in north walesthe film is obviously a satire on the intrusiveness and obsession with celebrity of the modern media added relevance was given by the fact that it came out shortly after the death of princess diana there is however more to it than that much has been made of the film as religious allegory it has been pointed out that christof whose name is clearly and quite deliberately similar to christ is a godfigure whereas truman the true man is a symbolic everyman it has even been claimed that the film is an antireligious allegory with trumans final escape from seahaven symbolic of mans need to break away from outdated religious dogmas this is not an interpretation with which i would agree if one is trying to put across a god is dead message it seems odd to provide a godfigure who is very much real not mythical or illusory the imagery of the final scenes  the calm after the storm the ascent up a flight of stairs into the sky and clouds also struck me as religious rather than secular moreover the film seems too complex to be reduced to any single allegorical meaning although it certainly deals with the relationship between man and god it also touches on mans need to explore both to explore new places and also to explore new ideas and to break away from established ways of life and ways of thought and on the nature of reality trumans world may seem unreal to us but as christof says we accept the reality we are presented withthis is a brilliant multilayered film part comedy part satire part philosophical speculation and in my view one of the two best movies of the late nineties the other was american beauty i felt it should have taken the best picture oscar for 1999 shakespeare in love is a good film but is a great one it confirms my view that peter weir is one of the best directors currently working 1010,black_comedy
ive seen a multitude of times and each time it gets better first watching it at a young age roughly 10 years old i never picked up on much of the deeper meaning behind the film the idea of someones whole life being a television program was simply entertaining now as an older viewer and with more experience in analyzing books and movies i can really pick up on the satirical meaning behind the plot truman plays the star of a 247 television program his entire life is broadcasted for all the world to see he is raised to believe that there is no real reason to try and leave his perfect island throughout the film we watch as truman tries time and time again to discover the truth behind his life and as he attempts to escape the struggle he experiences while trying to break free from the artificial world can be seen as a satirical message the world is trying to oppress you and although difficult you can escape this is supported by a statement made by the creator of he said we accept the reality of the world with which we are presented its as simple as that several other hidden messages ideas appear throughout the film all the actors who play roles in trumans life are indeed fake despite directly lying to a person whose life is immediately affected by that lie the actorsactresses show no emotion for truman this is comparable to the lack of care society has for the majority of its citizens overall is filled with subliminal messages and hidden meanings all of which can be directly tied back to daily life,black_comedy
it not so easy to be jim carrey because nobody takes you seriously after many funny movies even when he is absolutely brilliant he proved himself so many times in dramas he is so great actorthis time there is no grade for the script 10 is too low maybe 10 would suffice i must agree that in everything around us we can see only what we are capable to see but this movie gives so many levels and many people would see it differently and all will be thrilled by this moviepeople who are interested in the phenomenon of big brothera kind of tv voyeurism so present today will see the ultimate human desire to observe somebodys life from its beginning and without consent of the person which is the object of that observing there is nothing special in this man who is watched but we like to have mirrors of our lives in other people who knows why of course the next layer is ethical do we have the right to watch somebodys life because we dont talk about a rat but a human being who doesnt know that he is watched in a tv show if we go further we must ask ourselves what is real in our life there is is always some possibility that we are observed directed guided monitored by somebody and our life is not so authentic as we used to thinknext layer this movie talks about freedom and personal choice how we want to be free no matter what are the other alternatives are free to love who we want free to go free as much as it is possible of course if we want to be free if our mind and society stop usfinally the most interesting level is the spiritual onethis is a guidebook of the spiritual path at first this world is so secure and predictable place we have our little lives and we can define everything what is important for us to have some simplification of reality to feel safe this kind of ordinary life is a bit boring but we are in a herd we are not alone in our dungeonbut at some moment this world is maybe not what we thought it is maybe we want more of our livesand the world is not so simple and ordinary place we feel that there is something behind this so called reality and we start to search to test that reality which gives us more and more magic things as we go deeper this is still a stage of curiosity many people tasted this path and feeling but at some superficial levelif we go further we must fight the world all possible obstacles will arise people and circumstances when truman wants to see reality what it is to be free all his friends and the complete crew dont let him to go our the ordinary tracks so alike the spiritual quest then the moment has come men must be separated from boys that is the curious people from the real seekers the latter are ready to give even their lives to waste their time to face their worst fears to be hunted by the society which wants they to be normal again but a true spiritual person wont give up the same as truman youl have to kill me the quest is the real one only if we are totally determined to follow our inner feeling and to search the truth at last we hit the border of the world the frontiers of the reality we get know what this world really is we are free to talk with our god though i think it is the final trick of our ego to bring us back to be normal again and it plays so many games to pull us back by saying that there is nothing out there everything is the same and it is better in realm of illusion only a real spiritual person will say thanks for the offer and go to freedom no matter what it is but it is our freedom our insight the world wont be the same anymore it is such a pity that this is a kind of review that i cant make a spoiler to give more details to relate the scenes from the movie and my points but when you see it youll know what i am talking aboutagain youll see what you are able to see the movie will be deep in degree of your ability to open your mind this scenario cant be beaten even by movies like gandhi or mozart or any other an excellent work of andrew niccol,black_comedy
i loved this movie everything about it it is one you just want to watch over and over again jim carey as usually played an amazing role he made you think you were him as the whole movie did watch it its a mustimagine being captivated all your life in a show without knowing your neighbors your family your loved ones everyone you ever knew were just actors pretending to be people they are not well truman burbank not only imagined it but also lived it this is a hilarious movie that will catch you from the first minute you watch it just be aware once you start watching it it will be difficult to stop i rate this movie 55 with no negative comments,black_comedy
owes a lot to the direction of peter weir weir refuses to pump out the movies in a search for extra dollars instead he chooses wisely and directs brilliantly just by looking at a list of his movies will surprise and even amaze you so as you would imagine is another successtruman burbank has the perfect life or so he thought until finally his life long suspicions about his world begin to unravel even though the idea for truman is not totally original it is thought provoking enough and allows the audience to wonder what if if you think this couldnt happen just look back over the years at the stupidity of the human race and think againjim carrey once again nails his role as do the entire cast it is rare he fails to perform at a level that perfectly complements the movie and its genre this is something he does not receive enough credit for acting for a comical role or a more dramatic role requires no less effort for the performance to be spot on,black_comedy
its not often a hollywood film arrives with such lofty ambitions as this on one hand this is a high concept comedy in the vein of groundhog day about an unwitting man whose entire life has been a tv show  this is also a jim carrey vehicle designed to display his charms  on the other hand this a very satirical look at the way the media manipulates our reality  the film also wants to take a philosophical look at free will vs a higher power and reality vs fantasy  it doesnt always work as the satire often keeps you from thinking too deeply about the underlying themes and the philosophical stuff keeps the satire from biting as well as it could  credit engaging performances and solid and thoughtful direction from weir for keeping things afloat and entertaining  there are some great cinematic moments here  i loved the stolen kiss on the beach at night and cue the sunin the end this film is closer in spirit to psychological dramas and scifi movies where a person suddenly realizes they are the pawn in some grand experiment or a prisoner in an alien world than it is to anything in our current reality tv obsessed culture  eventually it touches on a very basic conflict all humans must face most people do so in childhood some i fear never do  the universe does not revolve around us  in the closing moments we are excited for truman because he finally realizes there is a whole new world out there to explore but also slightly saddened because we know all to well that he will never be able to return to that idyllic childhood existence  hows it going to end  who knowsbut things will never be the same,black_comedy
when i was a young adult on the search for my true self religion and god i found myself reading all kinds of books such as demian sidarta brave new world 1984 the works of jean paul sartre and simone de bolvoir the world of truman burbank certainly took me back to those days i used to look at myself in the mirror and say out loud i wonder if i am me i wonder if everybody thinks the same shade of red when i say red why was i born why are my parents my parents why did god create the world will i get punished by god for thinking all these things this is a deep movie bound to become an art film  jim carey did such a superb job that it earned him a golden globe award this is definitely an oscar contender it made me think what a suprise movies do not make me think very often they are predictable to me now could it be agewhen the lady comes on the bike with the basket then the dog and then the yellow volkswagen it reminded me of how repetitive life seems at times when we think that nothing is going to change and we want changes the director was like god  the creator  although at times he was a mean guy i think that all of us have questioned god and have been angry at him trumans world seemed so perfect no messy hair no trash just phony our world seems much like that everything is a matter of perceptionthe audience that watched in the movie was a hedonistic audience of consumers who wanted to be entertained no matter what the cost to truman reminded me of the soaps of the paparazzi of how we like to know about the celebrities and ultimatly of how the product could be the death of someone such as princess diana or truman burbankpurchase the video and watch it many times and many other symbols will come to mind like jim carey stated while he received the golden globe that he would enjoy it down to the crunchy chewy part,black_comedy
although it sometimes seems that hollywood is catering to the lowest common denominator of everything is proof that there are great ideas that are able to be turned into great movies  jim carrey plays an excellent role as a man with whom you can emphasize as well as be entertained by  the films surrealistic nature is frightening when the viewer realizes the legal feasibility in todays society and it offers a great message about who or what we assume god to be and how he he would react to our personal drives for discovery to challenge a world we treat as an aquarium  some things to note and ponder the way the reallife viewers ignore the real lives of their compatriots and customers while focusing on a false life on screen whose life is more real and whose is worth living  also note that christof does not have his name listed among the real world in the credits but in christofs world  his highprofile mediadriven life is no different from trumans,black_comedy
having been bandied about the release schedules for the best part of a year carreys first semidramatic film finally got a uk release last october he plays truman burbank a vaguely unhappy insurance salesman in the perfect little seaside town of seahaven following some strange occurrences truman starts to think that he is being watched little does he know that his entire life is secretly filmed his town is a gigantic soundstage everyone he has ever known was an actor and that his every waking and sleeping second is broadcast around the world as a toprated docusoapcritics have been lavishing enormous praise on this movie since it opened in america last june and probably rightly so because it is a superbly crafted piece of work weirs direction is outstanding frequently viewing events from the point of view of hidden spy cameras such as the one in trumans car radio one stunning shot has the towns main street full of motionless extras waiting for truman to turn the corner jim carreys performance has been singled out for particular praise and though his acting is of a much higher standard that his usual comedy antics it is not exactly laurence olivier this said an oscar nomination would have been well deservedthe setting of a chirpy small town from which escape is impossible echoes cult 60s series the prisoner but the balance of reality and poetry is much more restrained here than it was then the opening credits are especially clever using those of the actual show eg truman burbank as himself there are however a few problems the film is simply too short to adequately explore trumans situation and the character of meryl his wife disappears about halfanhour from the end this kind of slightly sloppy scripting was not something i expected from writer andrew niccol whose previous film gattaca which he also directed was such an immediate classic gripes aside this is an extraordinary and highly original film that really is worth seeing several times to fully understand the directors message it doesnt even matter if you never liked jim carrey before you will now,black_comedy
is a rarity in hollywood  or movies in general  a film that actually makes the audience think and is about ideas how do we know what we see is real why do we accept what is around us without questioning it what would happen if we found out that a fundamental we were making about the world turned out to be completely wrong youd think a movie that was about those things would be a chore to get through but in fact is great fun i certainly wouldnt call it a comedy although there are a few light moments here and there but its not too heavy and goes down easyit might sound like exaggeration but the scene where truman first starts to realize whats going on is one of the best scenes ive seen in any movie because of carreys acting the direction and also because of the philip glass soundtrack which was critical to making that scene workif you havent seen do yourself a favor and check it out,black_comedy
as many fans know jim carrey is the man when it comes to slapstick comedy his comical physicality is outrageous and his ability to emulate anything from cartoons to other actors is top notch but anytime before 1998 i think i can safely say that not many people saw carrey try and jump out of his shell and try a role that wasnt truly in the comedy genre i definitely didnt see it coming and to be honest i wasnt sure if i would really enjoy it but in the end i did not only because of how well carrey portrayed his character but with an excellent story to back if upthe plot is about truman burbank jim carrey who is viewed live 24 hours a day uncensored as a soap opera to the real world through public broadcasting the thing is truman burbank is the only one who doesnt know this everything else around is all a setup and when i mean everythingeverythingis a setup even the sun is fake nothing is real all the people burbank knows are all actors people who go through the same routine every dayand thats partially what makes this film so great every piece of the set that truman burbank lives in is so believable along with this is christof acted by ed harris christof is the creator of trumans world and he essentially plays god everything that truman burbank is as a person was created under the supervision of christof the whole story itself written by andrew niccol brings up the controversial issue of nature vs nurture who should have control over whose life well i think that answer is obviousjim carrey himself actually does have some comedic moments but its not because he wants the movie to be a comedy carrey does what he does because it is the connection to how a human would react to such a situation that makes it funny and along with those funny moments comes a real emotional performance sure carrey can deliver laughs but also proves that he can portray human drama thats a question a lot of people wanted to see if carrey could pull off and he did it welladding to the emotion is composer philip glass score yes it did evoke the right emotions and i dont think it needed a theme either for this particular story usually i do but it didnt seem necessary here unfortunately for me i prefer to see jim carrey in his comedic skin i didnt mind the different role that he took on here but it didnt feel like i was watching the movie i wanted to see and ill admit i put too much thought into believing jim carrey wouldve made the film more comedy than drama so basically i disappointed myself so on that note it could be disappointing to fans of carrey for his comedic films as wellas the first drama film that comic gut buster jim carrey stars in it is not that bad as some would expect it to be carrey can deliver a performance like real human but for the hardcore fans it may upset,black_comedy
have you ever thought you were being watched like you life was possibly a television show well truman burbank never did and this movie tells of how he found out his life was a tv showquite possibly one of the most imaginative plots ever peter weirs shows how one mans vision ed harris of having someones life be on tv that being truman played by jim careywithout him knowing it a totally real show that has no boundaries except the walls of the enormous set with actors playing the roles of the townspeople in this perfect community as it seemsjim carey is brilliant as the confused insurance salesman who just wants the truth about his life the death of his father drowning at sea has given truman a reason to stay in his town and not venture off but the urge to see the woman of his dreams is all to much she was moved to fiji because of some problems laura linney plays trumans wife she isnt only his wife but is a walking commercial whenever there is a product she brings home it seems like she is telling the world how great it is noah emmerich plays trumans best friend marlon this always uplifting character brings comic relief for truman when he needs it most when trumans world seems to be falling apart hes there when truman just needs a friend hes there marlon is the one part of his life that makes it seem so real when everything else seems so fakewhat makes this movie so enjoyable other than the story is how the people act in this town the way they make sure truman stays there and doesnt leave how everybody has a routine and even the weather is controlled in the opening scene truman wakes up and heads off to work to have a stage light fall right in the street where it came fromhe doesnt know but doesnt worry about it because life is going greatfor now ed harriss character cristof aka the creator is genius and maniacal with his people working around the clock to make sure all is well this world he has created is now a world wide phenomenon he is on top of the world with millions of people watching his creation unfoldthis sensational film about a man trying to find his way in the world is incredible when everything seems like it doesnt add up it just keeps getting more complicated and giving the viewer one hell of a good movie is in a league of its own,black_comedy

with its all intentional of course cheerfully colorful cinematography cheesy music and onedimensional supporting characters its easy to miss just how brilliant is its in fact one of the most important cinematic creations of the 1990s at least as important as darker films like american history x and fight club and one that works on several different levels because while it works quite clearly as a sarcastic satire and a commentary on the destructive and intrusive nature of the media in the postmodern age in the light of the reality tv syndrome which was at the time just starting to grow its also a philosophical metaphor about the state of mankindfor trumans story is mans story and its difficult not to see the importance in the names given to the lead characters true mans life the film says is an illusion a lie or perhaps  all our lives are illusions but the true man is the one who figures it out and seeks a deeper truth in its essence the point is very similar to the one the matrix made is a fascinating trip through platos cave and while it takes a rather simplistic look at platos philosophy  because any other way would be impossible in a film of less than two hours  it doesnt dumb it down is a deep and intricate film that deserves repeated viewing and gets better with time and can be discussed for hourswriter andrew niccol  who made his breakthrough debut one year before with the critically acclaimed cult favorite gattaca  lost the oscar that year to the academys favorite shakespeare in love and director peter weir got most of the credit for the film but while its certainly an important achievement for weir and the best film of his long career its niccols sarcastic intelligent innovative script that made great that and the amazing performance by jim carrey who showed his fantastic dramatic skills here for the first time carrey is enchanting in the lead role as the ultimate everyman truman and were as fascinated with him as the shows fans in the film praise should also go to ed harris who plays christof creator and director of and again special attention should be given to the characters name  and also to laura linney noah emmerich natasha mcelhone harry shearer peter krause paul giamatti and the rest of the wonderful supporting cast both in trumans world of seahavan and in christofs real world finally a word of praise for the excellent musical score composed by burkhard von dallwitz and the great philip glass which compliments the films atmosphere to perfectionis not an easy movie to absorb its a disturbing tale and a disturbing message which takes some time to seep in and while its entirely unconvincing as a reality and even as scifi and feels more like a metaphor than a story of a specific man its also entirely involving and demands to be taken at face value trumans character is irresistibly charming and just like the people watching we believe in him and identify with him completely the beauty of is that its lots of fun it proves that entertainment and art are not necessarily opposing ideals by being entirely entertaining and gripping it gets its messages across a whole lot betteris now eight years old the way i see it once a decade has passed a film can begins to be considered a classic will pass that test in any possible aspect is one of the absolute best films of the 90s and one that will remain relevant long after reality tv has bitten the dust,black_comedy
with released in 1998 peter weir delivers a brilliant satire about the excesses of reality shows with a prophetic relevance disguised under a misleading comedic mask this underrated gem of the 90s tells the original to say the least story of truman burbank played by jim carrey in a breakthrough dramatic performance with this bit of tender wackiness we expect from him truman is an ordinary insurance salesman living in the small peaceful town of seahaven hes popular and lives in harmony with his wife his mother his best friend his colleagues and neighbors in appearance only  what truman doesnt know and heres the visionary originality on which relies his life is that seahaven is in fact a huge studio with 5000 cameras always keeping an eye on him and that everyones an actor including his wife his mother his best friend etc and last but not least all his life was filmed since his birth to become the greatest and longestrunning reality show in television history truman believed in a reality which is in fact completely fictional and all the protagonists of this pseudo reality are puppets hanging on the string of the shows creator who designs the perfect screenplay creating emotional cliffhangers for future episodes the creator is kristoff brilliantly portrayed by ed harris like a kind of almighty god and the human incarnation of medias omnipotence and truman eventually realizes that his life is a huge hoax and decides to leave the perfect utopia of seahaven and go discover the real world because thats the point reality shows dont depict reality but paint it with fiction its real fiction but fiction nonetheless the ambivalence is obvious in trumans life is fictional because all the protagonists play a role in order to create a story for the viewers viewers who follow the show like a soap opera with a realistic dimension indeed trumans character is real as stated by the creator of the show he is the only real protagonist of this world his reactions are spontaneous and sincere the reality is pushed to unscrupulous limits because unlike other shows truman doesnt know hes filmed hes natural his life is a fiction but paradoxically a real one this is the semantic loophole unscrupulous tv program managers use to justify the unrealistic aspect of their shows the scripts fascinating brilliance reminds of network in the 70s highlighting many unpleasant aspects of tv reality including the viewers tacit complicity indeed the viewer never minds the scripted aspect of reality as presented in tv programs as long as it improves his personal enjoyment like for all these people who were assiduously following in all over the world the second aspect is the subjectivity of reality truman for all his spontaneity and sincerity was unknowingly following the storyline that producers traced and all the situations were constructed to make him react according to a script the process of mediation doesnt prevent from spontaneity but it undermines its credibility by creating specific situations for premeditated reactions like in some programs where two people who dont appreciate each other or whose views totally differ are both invited just to create a violent verbal confrontation supposedly unexpected to please the audiencefinally the main lesson of the film lies on the climax where truman tries to leave the fictional world of seahaven materialized by the powerful symbol of a dome painted like a sky truman struggles to get outside before he faces the producer of the show the latter warns him against the dangers of a hostile real world where truth is no worthier than elsewhere and invites him to join the perfect utopia of seahaven where hes a hero trumans reaction is very symbolic he left the cameras world like an artist who addresses his fans for the last time with his famous catchphrase as a farewell and finally gets out this last pirouette sublimated by the thrilling score of the film earned him the applause of the audience as if the excitement made them forget that the show was ending indeed when the show was finally interrupted two viewers quickly recovered from their emotions and zapped to another program the end truman is a genuine character who understood the completely artificial status of his stardom he therefore preferred to leave a charming utopia and face the real world television today launches ordinary people at the rank of stars for the simple reason that we viewers observed their everydays moves the details of their lifes banality during weeks or months but that kind of artificial popularity is inevitably ephemeral it sinks into oblivion as soon as a new reality show emerges and thats because cameras point view as depicted in the film presents the reality in a dangerously subjective way the staging admitted by the public as it highlights positive values like friendship fame success and empathy is a dangerous emotional depiction of reality the risk is less for the viewer who accepts the process than for the protagonists of these emissions whose purely artificial and prefabricated fame can lead to deep feelings of frustration later the emotional excitement is binary and plays on both positive and negative poles it may present for the sake of transparency real people who suffer and live under difficult conditions whether in the context of stories talk or reality shows the danger here is moral because with this constant clash between reality and fiction how can we be sure that the depiction of suffering and frustration will inspire the audience positive psychological reactions like compassion and solidarity rather than a voyeuristic sadism mixed with a circumstantial empathydenounces the fictionalization of reality through a remarkable fiction that makes todays reality look like a less believable fiction ,black_comedy
have you ever felt like your not alone in you house that maybe just maybe theres over half of the world watching you is a film about a man called truman burbank jim carrey who lives a normal life with his normal job but he is living in an abnormal world because truman is living in his own world called sea heaven sea heaven is actually a set and his home and job is all a lie truman has a world based around him and what ever he does the citizens of sea heaven have to go along with it his mum dad wife and even his best friend are all actors is filmed with the highest technology in cameras around small clip on cameras that can clip on to a jacket and not be seen but when truman sees that elevators have 4 men drinking tea in the back of them and that the radio has coordinates of his position on it he starts to get suspicious has been nominated for three oscars and has won three baftas award winning director peter weir worked with paramount pictures to make this film a masterpiece is a film that just about makes up for the horrible disasters of godzilla and armageddon this film might be the film of the 90shad a strict budget of 60 million and earned 125 million in film screenings alone hasnt got any fancy graphics or any expensive cars or props its just pure film making and passionoverall is a very good film but my only criticism is that some of the background actors didnt look like they knew what they were doing but overall there was no big mistakes in the plot i would give this a five star rating,black_comedy
i sometimes wonder how my life will be if it were a tv show i see this movie and i quit the wonderwas written by andrew niccol who got the inspiration from an episode of the twilight zone called special serviceafter the script had gone through some rewrites jim carrey was picked for the role although the makers had to wait for him to have a clear schedule before he could start shootingmade with a budget of over  60 million dollars was a financial success and also was nominated for three categories in the academy awards but did not win any awardsthe movie tells the tale of an insurance salesman truman burbank jim carrey who lived his entire life since before birth in front of cameras forunaware of this fact trumans life is filmed through thousands of hidden cameras 24 hours a day 7 days a week and broadcast live around the world allowing executive producer christof ed harris to capture trumans real emotion and human behavior when put in certain situations that are concocted by the writersthe thrill about trumans life is that everything is arranged for him down to the woman he married to his best friendthe movie cinematography is such a way that you get to see mistakes from the show makers and how they arrange things in the back end to make truman do some particular thingsthe script and the movie lines are fun especially when the actors had to advertise on the show the could be a conversation going on then one of the actors will just drift to talk about an object in such a manner you wonder if they have lost it only for you to figure out seconds later that it was an advert in the show that was very creativebefore making this masterpiece jim carrey had just finish cable guy 1996 and liar liar 1997the movie is directed by peter weir master and commander the far side of the world 2003 who did a great job pulling the viewers along as they watch a movie of a show andrew niccol went ahead to do more great movies from s1m0ne with al pacino in 2002 to the terminal with steven spielberg and tom hanks in 2004,black_comedy
spoilers throughouttruman show is without a doubt careys best work i did not have the pleasure of seeing this until this year where after seeing bruce almighty and becoming somewhat of a jim carey fan i made an effort to watch more of his movies truman show is an instant classic in all the right ways its a smart well acted somewhat eerie and utterly unique masterpiece it also gets better the more you watch iti dont happen to like the genre of science fiction and nobody could deny truman shows got a bit of sci fi but i dont think it really falls under any one genre whats really scary is the ideathis conceptis not so out there anymore in todays times that one could completely rule out that this could ever happen its creepy very much so in the way that the original stepford wives is but more so in a way and i wonder about what would be said about the movie had it been released currently instead of the late 90s when reality tv was just starting to cause a ripplei first started changing my thoughts on carey after bruce almighty a great movie and one that is a lot more thought provoking then many give it credit for but as good as he was in that he simply shines in truman everyone does i loved laura linney as trumans annoying cold on screen wife meryl ive seen many of linneys movies this is one of her bestid advise people who havent seen truman show to see it more then oncethe first time i saw it i thought it was about an 8 or 9 it grows on you and its the kind of movie you want to see again as soon as it ends there are a few frustrating things to be sure i wish it had not ended so ambiguously id have liked to see more of trumans life after leaving the set his relationship with sylvia and what the other characters were feeling gone into a bit more also the audience was truman an instant celebrity when he left or was he quickly forgotten in favor of the next flavor of the month by his devoted audience as is a bit inferred truman show unlike about 95 percent of movies made does seem like a sequel could be made although with how bad most sequels are id be a bit wary still any flaws are not enough to prevent a 10 of 10 rating from me you could be watching this movie for the 50th time and it still seems like it would inspire the same reaction,black_comedy
is a tale that will tug at your heart strings its the movie that showed the world that jim carrey could play drama his wild gesticulating or face distortion barely make an appearance compared to his previous incarnationsthe film feels a little tacky but its dealing with a tacky subject reality tv it rode the wave of its inception as well as initial popularity and at the same time as it was making fun of it each character but the main one is a caricature of reality tv and its entourage even its dissidents it feels as fake as its subject yet it brings important points is happy ignorance better than truth do you define yourself or does your environmentthe sweetness of it all will capture you trumans predicament will rivet you the last scene will move yousee it its worth it,black_comedy
this is among pete weirs best just a notch or two under fearless or witness and much more worthwhile than weepies like dead poets societyjim carrey is relatively speakingsparing of gestures and hemgrimaceshoweverin my humble opinion the best performance comes from laura linneywhos very funnydelivering lines as she would do commercialsand always with that suave smile on her faceshe really acts as if shes in a playand she s anyway as paul mac cartney sang in penny laneed harris is effective as a sort of god tv has replaced god in many a homelike it or nothis spectacles and his bonnet make him almost unrecognizablethe humanism displayed by weir is very close to that of frank capraand jim carrey is some kind of james stewart of the ninetiesnavewith a big heartand like colombus his boat isnt it called santa mariahe has discovered a brand new worldwhether its the best one remains to be seen,black_comedy
you may not like it but you have to respect itbrilliant thoughtful director peter weir the last wave aka black rain picnic at hanging rock master and commander gallipoli dead poets society fearless and many others teams up with excellent screenwriter andrew niccol and a great cast to give us a science fiction film with a range of emotions exceedingly rare for big budget mainstream cinema in addition to the really disturbing questions the film raises about the nature of reality metaphysics religion entertainment human cruelty voyeurism and the concept of freedom the film also offers a glimpse of humanity simultaneously occupying its worst and best aspectsthe cast is phenomenally good carrey gives truman the life his rich and sympathetic character he deserves  providing some of the most disturbing comedy i have ever witnessed tasha mcelhone ed harris peter krause and laura linney are all excellent  though you may end up hating most of them for various reasons as the film progressestrumans entire life from his birth onward has been one long tv show he is literally being broadcast 247365 and he knows nothing of it his mom wife best friend and everybody around him are all cast members and the show is shot in a giant set which simulates an island because of a traumatic experience with the sea during his childhood truman does not feel free to travel away from his island homeyet truman is oddly compelled to explore the world and has begun to suspect that something is very wrong meanwhile in what we like to think of as the real world everybody is watching him people stay home from work to participate vicariously in his life in hopes that they will somehow catch a clue to how it will end this film is pretty heavy you might find it amusing the first time you watch it but once youve allowed it to exhaust you a few times all that is left is the superb craft and the intense and disturbing ideas it constantly bombards you with the film has a dark side and a hopeful light but never airy side which  amazingly  is exposed concurrently with the heavy stuffthe cinematography is as pictureperfect as most of the work weir is associated with the acting is remarkably good all around with those mentioned above in the outstanding roles sound is usually a very important component of weirs films but its a little underexploited in  perhaps to sometimes with painful force draw the audiences attention to the profoundly insane dialogis plot heavy heavy a little funny and profoundly smart do not see it under the influence of anything detrimental to your mind or emotional balanceflex your head,black_comedy
is a unique film about the television obsession or  as a true allegory  any kind of obsession and the limits that people seem to leave behind when theyre talking much about profit human dignity law any type of principals are pretty much dead during the first half of the film alongside truman of course the movie make you realise all the above and highlights the unfairness of the casethe pictures end where the two guards just change channel after just a second of the end of a 30yearsprogram seems to only give more emphasis to the moral of the whole filmis a masterpiece and a must watch with friends or family,black_comedy
this film hasnt aged a minuteits an incredible exploration of the human psyche and spirit to be sure but its also a love story the love story is between truman burbank and his true self in his trueness to himself he cannot accept this reality as presented by christof when he starts trying to escape it things and people start to look more transparent and he begins to see illusions everywhereit all starts with a stage light dropping out of the sky onto the street whoops as he is given more and more clues he starts trying new unpredictable things and observing the towns response this escalates and it becomes truly fascinatinghis obsession with lauren or sylvia as it were is just a little creepy yes but just how anyone would respond to being put in this situation is completely up for debate just what is the correct way to respond to this situation anyway remember he was born into it this is his whole lifechristofs response to his escape attempt is indicative of his mindset truman is a christof productionthat is christof owns him there was never any doubt that trumans spirit would overcome everything thatd been programmed into him because this is the story of a man who refuses to be a product to be owned to be a slave you dont have cameras in my mindi saw this for the first time when it came out and it has remained one of my favorite movies of all time i found the ending to be stunning watching this illusion fall like a house of cards is almost spiritual there are no fancy special effects other than the aerial view of the trumans set any other effects are quite transparent no out of control selfindulgent fanciness no blockbusterism present at all merely solid craft work and an incredibly well done storythats all it needs if you havent already see it,black_comedy
i recently watched in my ela class during our satire unit i was pleasantly surprised when the movie actually turned out to be good before watching i read the description and i had my doubts but those were quickly cast aside while watching jim carrey play the main character truman so well jims funny personality really drove home the humor in the movie serious scenes were expertly acted by all members of the cast and i found myself enjoying every minute of the filmincluded many satirical elements inside some of the funnier scenes in the movie the film uses satire as a means to show the audience that forcing your own ideals on someone is not always a good idea in the movie the director tries to play god and run the life of truman truman eventually finds out that his entire life is a lie and tries to escape after truman finds the exit of his artificial world the director tries to convince truman to stay by telling him that the world he has been living in is better than the real world but truman decides to leave anyways the message behind this is a strong one and the movie did a good job of getting its message across,black_comedy
its a good movie i guess but once you leave the theater thats it its over but if you really do want more of that paranoic fun of watching reality unravel you can read this storytime out of joint by philip k dick synopsis ragle gumm was living with his sister and her family in 1959 solving newspaper puzzles but his normal life began to change one day and he noticed things getting really strange he thought he was losing his mind but instead he was going sane and the year was 1996,black_comedy
could have been so good  there were good intentions behind it and clearly some people with huge ability working on it  the problem was that though it pretended it was treating the audience as an intelligent entity it took the typical hollywood attitude of presuming that after all that we would not think about this filmthe subject matter demands that as we leave the cinema we must think about the questions that have been asked of us  to what extent is the media dominating or commanding our lives do we live to see others manipulated is what around us real or a projection of our imaginations however sick and warped that may be  all very well in fact excellent  too few films ask us to question the world around us  but this is where we run into problems you see once you start thinking about the film you realise quite how many holes there are in the plotforgive me but i would presume that if a man is brought up in a fake world he would never know it was fake because it wasnt fake to him  for truman burbank there can be no real world because in reality to him everything outside the tv studio which is his reality is fake  forgive me if im not explaining myself clearly enough  let me put it like this  if all your life the rain simply followed you about and did not touch others would you question it  the answer is no because that is the way things are for youfor truman to one day start thinking this is a bit weird is not only unlikely and out of character it could never happen  similarly he would not only not find it odd that people around were constantly advertising products he would adopt that speech pattern himself  ultimately this would lead to the failure of the show itself because truman would no longer be a real man to the viewers instead he would be more like a trained monkey performing tricks  but this is straying from the point though it does demonstrate how examination of the film proves how badly thought through it isnow onto a second complaint why is it that the people around truman have no feelings for him  they have grown up with him gone through life with him yes i accept he is their life line but i find it hard to believe that a man who has played his best friend for the best part of 30 years cannot care for him in the slightest  not even his parents seem to have any real interest in his wellbeing despite the fact that they have brought him up as if he were their own  are the makers of this film so cynical that they cannot give even the smallest amount of humanity to these charactersi have several other problems with the film particularly the ending which was one of the most utterly contrived moments on film i have ever seen as well as the lack of scope given to the shows creator christof easily the best thing in it and the unnecessary love interest  however the major flaw of this film was the idea behind it  it was so good that i dont think anyone really stopped to think out the complexities before making itit is such a shame because what could have been so good turned out to be so bad,black_comedy
i liked the premise of the film a boy is raised from infancy in a controlled environment for the benefit of not science but for the benefit of a rapt television audience the possibilities were there for tremendous tension and confrontation however what we got was a feelgood copout ending of such massive proportion that i literally felt like shaking the filmmakers and saying what were you thinkingspoilers aheadthe main reason for my wrath was the ending if you have not seen the film you are duly warned to stop reading herewe are supposed to cheer for truman along with the television audience as he finds the doorway to freedom i felt that to be a major copout truman needed to confront the people who turned his entire life into a lie i wanted to see him confront his socalled best friend who lied to truman pointblank where was the payback where was the justice where was the ethical outrage we get humorous scenes of free truman factions attempting to alert truman to his plight but does truman ever make anyone feel bad for what they did to him christof certainly felt justified in his approach as did all of the paid actors and the tv audience but if i was truman id use the opportunity to teach christof the actors and the tv audience a lesson about how to treat people but it was an opportunity squanderedin my opinion there were only 2 good characters in the film truman and the woman he loved other than that every other character lies to truman every other character deceives truman there needed to be some satisfactory confrontation but there wasnt it was the most empty feeling ive ever had watching a movie i only rated it on film quality and not script content because the film is actually very artfully executedbut my point is this escape in this case trumans sometimes isnt enough you sometimes must teach those who wronged you a lesson you must show them the error in their ways and those responsible should pay dearly for their moral and ethical transgressions this movie thoroughly disappointed me,black_comedy
there are two types of moviegoers people who like this movie and intelligent people this is the most overrated movie i have ever seen the story is so poorly done its a crime i am truly shocked so many people like this movie the scene where ed harris talks to jim carrey like hes god is the true low point of this film and a perfect example of why this movie isnt good,black_comedy
my rating  910if youve ever wondered whether your life is just one big sitcom illustrates what happens when one man played by jim carrey realizes that his entire life is scripted for televisiona thoroughly enjoyable movie and one of my favourite jim carrey moviestruly thoughtprovoking,black_comedy
i have never liked jim careys humor i have found it to very broad and boorish however i was very happy that i saw and am surprised i did considering my feelings about his earlier comedies thankfully carey showed he could act and not ham it upa tribute to his native talents as well as the director and writer with a weak director carey might have begun to seek laughs in 1001 crazy ways here however its straight and quite endearing i could talk about the plot but there are already a bazillion reviews for this one the bottom line is that dont assume because you dont like dumb and dumber or ace ventura you wont love this film and i really loved and think its a lovely film with a lot of heart and an awful lot of imaginationby the way i would say the same things about will farrell and adam sandler despite disliking some of there very broad films there serious films such as reign over me or stranger than fiction are exceptional additionally i gotta admit that i did enjoy a few of their stupid films such as water boy and talladega nights so dont assume that just because you may not like a few of their films means they all are not your cup of tea,black_comedy

is an absolutely amazing film that transcends beyond the boundaries of conventional moviemaking and storytelling  i remember coming out of the theater the night i saw it not knowing how to feel  should i laugh  should i cry  be happy or sad  it was unbelievable  the idea of a mans whole life being televised and scripted is certainly an original and creative one and on the whole an upsetting one  its hard for me to watch truman burbank brilliantly played by jim carrey suffer and be so blatantly deceived and lied to by those he crosses and even lives with  he doesnt know that his whole life wasnt under his control until things in the show dont quite go as planned  a piece of equipment from the set falls from the sky truman bumps into his dead father who wandered into the set and he learns his wife actually hates him  what really upset me about the film was having to watch all those actors and actresses lie betray and deceive truman  worse yet the fans of the show are cold hearted and cruel enough to keep watching even at the peak of trumans suffering  of course thats what people do with movies and tv watch people go through their trials and tribulations pains and sufferings  the only difference here is that the star of the show isnt pretending  luckily he takes action and initiates an escape while the shows creator battles to keep him on the set  finally in a devastating scene truman comes to terms with reality that he never had a life  thankfully it was redeemed when he proudly walked out of the set and ventured out into the world  what you may not know is that is actually a film about god  the creators name is christof related to christ and he orchestrates every day of trumans life  dont worry about tomorrow because god has already taken care of it for you also i didnt think christof was playing god  i thought it a satirical way he really was god  he was the creator of a show that gave hope joy and inspiration to millions as did god with the world and his son jesus his wrath and anger was inflicted upon truman when he tried to leave the set or the garden of eden and learn the truth about his life thus receiving the fruit of knowledge  christof throws a violent biblical storm at truman and after truman survives the storm he screams out is that the best you can do on his sailboat the santa maria or the holy mary  the ultimate is the ending where truman appears to be walking on water towards the stairway to heaven not knowing if he is dead or alive or if its reality or nightmare  christof speaks to truman through the clouds in a deep godlike voice telling him that he has been watching him his whole life  another aspect of christofs godlike qualities is that he isnt actually evil and all he wants is to do what he thinks is best for truman in my world you have nothing to fear  a couple of times in the film christof pets truman on the tv screen a sign of gentleness and love finally truman gracefully bows before god and walks out of the set and into the unknown world thus adam and eve leaving the garden of eden and venturing out into the real world  the whole awesome power of the climax brought tears to my eyes on more than one occasion  its the first time in my life that a film could have such a strong inspirational impact on me it really shook me up  i was deeply upset that this film got a disappointing 2 academy award nomination neither of which won  jim carrey wasnt nominated although looking back on his career as the rubberfaced maniac who talked out of his ass in ace ventura its amazing that he was even involved in such an earth shattering film let alone play the main character  but he did it  he gave truman a likeable intelligent curious and sad quality  i remember seeing the trailer for the first time in theaters and thinking oh boy  another jim carrey comedy  how wrong i was  this film was a serious provocative and inspirational one that put away all the laughter with the exception of the man in the bath tub  i remember desperately trying not to cry at the climax watching truman bang on the wall of the set learning in a painful instant the reality of his life  what would have been really sad is if he never escaped although an ending like that would be pointless because the message and the meaning would be lost  hopefully the afiamerican film institute will put this on their list as one of the best films ever made which i strongly would stand up for and believe it to be true in every sense of the word,black_comedy
cliched simpleton nonsense that jim carrey was able to tone his   ace ventura act down to moderately annoying as opposed to the usual extremely annoying is not enough to warrant nods for acting coupled with a script that borders on madefortv fare the result is painful to watch,black_comedy
what i liked about was the setting and the cinematography  the production values are good which sometimes impresses me more than it should  at least in this case the resulting sense of realism is very satisfyingbut the story seemed muddled and pointless truman goes through a random process of discovery and then breaks free  so what can it be possible that the message of this movie is that we watch too much tv that many of us have trouble distinguishing entertainment from reality  that everything in life is an illusion  if it isnt one of these hoary platitudes what is it  even when someone suggested that the movie is an updated version of the escape from the garden of eden and so probably has something to do with loss of innocence i still end up asking so what  theres a dormroom earnestness about that left me cold  you might love it  its definitely worth a trymay be like citizen kane a movie that everyone knows is great but that hardly anyone asks for at the video rental store except extreme cineastes,black_comedy
i stopped watching tv for two weeks after i saw and now i try not to watch anything other than the news or movies  jim carrey can act in a drama and he was simply incredible in this movie,black_comedy
god  i wanted to like this film  i think jim carrey is a good actor  an excellent physical comic hes also capable of giving a heartfelt truthful performance  he does it hereconfound it i want to like everything peter weir does  i frequently dont but im always willing to give him the benefit of the doubt  anyone who can do a picnic at hanging rock cant be all bad  he obviously has the capacity to make us see feel understand without overstating the obvious while skirting the obvious for heavens saketherefore should have been one of my years high points cinematically  maybe i was in a bad mood when i saw the advanced screening i returned and actually paid to see it  maybe the firstview dyspepsia carried over maybe i hadnt given it enough timei rented itokay i liked it less the second time i saw it  i almost hated it on the third viewing  i know i knowa film  play painting jokewhatever  is meant to be grabbed on a first view a single exposure  repeated looks are bound to let us explore the flawsbut dammit i was trying to give the thing a break  really  it is the kind of thing i should lovewhats wrong with truman  its one of those things that says its going to do something  it tells us what it intends to show then proceeds to not show us but to restate the thesis  and the audience is expected to buy into the notion that the film has actually explored the issues whatever they aretruman for me is all statement and no delivery  it gives us a wonderfully correct themea charming easy to rootfor heroa potentially exciting and interestingly equivocal villainthen blows it all away because it hasnt got the courage of its own setupwhat would make truman despite a lifetime of conditioning get on that boat  nothing  he so easily accepts the unacceptable he so easily overcomes every problem the film gives him that there is no dramatic tension no questions nono filmof course it presents us with a userfriendly feelgood ending  the sitcom man takes charge of his life  victory  vindication  and we dont even have a clue what trumans life  or life in general  is aboutnor alas does hesorry  too facilelike jim carreys talking buttan easy laugh a gofortheguaranteedresult  this film for me is a smug simplistic selfcongratulatory exercise in hollywood telling us whats wrong with hollywood  and usgo write your own screenplay on this theme  anyone could do it better,black_comedy
what we have here is a film with great potential potential to become one of the great dystopian films it raises such themes as a nation obsessed by television the means used to provide people their purile entertainment without any consideration of ethics nor human dignity truman could be a great tragedy we could see one man live a meaningless life forever watched by millions of big brothers completely unaware of his fishbowl existence a warning pointing to the disconnect and disassociation we all experience upon seeing someone on a television screen and also to our slavish instinct to glorify these people without knowing why we adore themand i cant help but think of this when i see all the thousands of mediocrities line up to make complete fools of themselves on national tv on socalled reality shows all in the name of a few brief and unmemorable moments of fame weve been brainwashed by the media into believing that fame it itself is a desirable virtuebut this movie instead of exploring these issues in depth skirts around them afraid of giving itself intellectual depth and weight instead were treated to jim careys charming smile and empty acting this film has the potential to be a memorable and indepth dystopian vision of fame and the media instead out of pure cowardice its turned into another meaningless popcorn movie a complete waste of celluloid all the people involved in this should be ashamed of themselves,black_comedy
when the movie started i hoped id see a movie that utilized the potentiality of what this kind of plot has finding that your whole life was one big lie  and the emotional crisis that follows it alas that was not to follow  i hoped the movie would go on from the point truman successfully escaped the place but instead the movie endedi was dismayed that the director didnt realise what great potentiality the movie would had if we could see the emotions truman would go thru when he finds the real worldtm one would go insane from going from a safe haven to a more unfriendlier and tough world which would be very interesting to see  and give the movie a much more emotional edge which is a shame because at its current form it does not live up to the hype it had back then,black_comedy
no phrase can really explain this movie the idea of having a man grow up in a 50s sitcomstyle universe without him knowing it and then show it as a tvshow 24 hours a day is a somewhat perverted idea but everybody in this movie seems to eat it up it is not that i am against movies with questionable morals but it seems the situation the main character truman is in gives everybody some kind of unexplainable ecstasy they are almost slobbering at the screen and all they are really seeing is a person who does pretty much what we all do every dayit might seem like an odd way to start this commentary but i cant for the life of me think of a better way this is no ordinary movie and the premise is somewhat unusual but still i dont know why it is supposed to be so brilliant a man is followed around by cameras all day and night and doesnt know it all well and good but why does the he have to live in a totally artificial universe where everybody he knows is a fake and why does christof believe that he is god because he controls the destiny of one man when truman begins to suspect that something is wrong christof will destroy everything he has created to keep truman in the universe which no longer exists because truman has become aware of itto say that this is a entertaining film would be stretching the truth if it is an educational film it doesnt teach me anything am i supposed to think tv is bad please why use a movie then to teach the lesson am i supposed to think people are drones who follow every direction which is shoved down their throats then why sohw it in a movie which is supposed to sell tickets bought by the same people all these questions and many more will probably not be answered by the filmmakers or anyone else in the next episode,black_comedy
excruciatingit has so little to say and takes so long to say it this movie give you a good idea of what watching the real truman show must be like maybe because i had heard about it before seeing it i expected some profound insights from this movienopemy friends pretty much covered it all when they told me its about a guy whose life is a tv show and everyone knows except him intriguing idea i kept waiting for more but it never came at least jim carrey is fun to watch,black_comedy
i think this is a fantastic film it is one of my favorites i think it is funny touching and even sad you cant help but feel badly for poor truman when he starts discovering things arent what they seem i think my absolute favorite line in this movie is from christof when he said cue the sun sure maybe its impossibly expensive to build an entire town inside a sphere and create a tv show about a persons life without them knowing it but when was the last time you saw the star ship enterprise or voyager flying over earth  its a great fantasy movie thats all it is the acting in this movie is superb especially that of jim carry and ed harris ed harris character is so evil the way he thinks he knows whats best for truman one line he says i am the creatorpauseof a television show that brings hope and joy to millions its almost as if he has a god complex well i think he does i have to wonder if such a show actually aired where a persons life was on the air 247 from infancy to adult would we actually watch it ,black_comedy
interesting premise of television programming focused on one man carrey who is unaware of his prominence  i enjoyed the movie more the first time than the second im not sure it holds up very well to scrutiny  plot takes itself too seriously and hits you over the head with the concept  also carreys unawareness of his situation is a little too much to swallow worth a shot but dont expect too much,black_comedy
theres a point at which some works of fiction ask you to convert the willing suspension of disbelief which we must bring to any fictional work into throwing all critical faculties completely to the winds and thats what happens here this film is mildly entertaining for a whileuntil you start actually thinking about some of what it asks you to take for granted 1 weather on demand while weve all seen wave making pools has anyone actually seen the technology to create violent localized storms while there are some who claim the secret government has such weather control technology even they supposedly can only do it over a large area on a sound stage this could only have been done with giant fans and large obvious waterspewing machinery where were the fans and the other machinery or are we supposed to believe all that weather just came out of thin air 2 ventilation with all the car exhaust and heat generated by the community and the artificial lighting there obviously would have to be giant air conditioning systems remember the dome was supposed to be a closed sealed location to dissipate the heat and provide fresh air where were all the giant vents that wouldve been needed the ac equipment the constant noise that large ac equipment generates 3 wouldnt truman have noticed that there were never any airplanes or helicopters seen flying anywhere wouldnt he have asked why dont we have any aircraft here i cant think of any excuse for that which would have been even remotely plausible 4 for this community to have gone on so long it wouldve meant that all of trumans schoolmates weer actors who grew up there along with him does anyone really think that so many children actors no less could have kept such a big secret for so many years come on now you can bet that more than one kid over all that time wouldve felt the need to spill the beans 5 laura linneys character was initially shown as a cheerleader that means that the islands high school played competitive sports with other schools sodoes that mean they never played an away game wouldnt truman have thought that to be a little strange and would all of the opposing teams athletes have agreed to be bought off and keep silent how much money would it have cost to buy the silence of those kids in addition to all of those mentioned in 4 above no tv show would have been able to marshal the huge budget necessary to pull all of this off on an ongoing basis  not to mention the huge budget just to pay all of the hundreds of actors 6 all tv radio magazines newspapers movies and internet yes internet existed when this movie was made coming to the island would have had to be censored of any references to theres no way a tv network would be able to exercise such total control truman would have noticed that the only media were locally generated wouldnt he have asked why he was cut off from everything else 7 even if the supposed explanation that he was adopted by a corporation was valid the moment he was restrained from free movement of any kind the corporation and thus christof was committing the felony of kidnapping  a federal crime which wouldnt have been excused 8 there were even internal inconsistencieseg christof said in the harry shearer interview that all revenues for the show were generated by product placement if thats so then why did meryl have to hold up various products to the camera and deliver spiels 9 were supposed to believe that meryl was so upset by some of the manifestations of trumans wakingup process that she breaks into tears and claims she cant work under these conditions its not professional but at the same time were supposed to believe that living for years in a sham marriage with a man she doesnt love and presumably routinely having sex with him was perfectly okay with her simply because it was a paid gig thats pretty cold even for hollywood,black_comedy
is easily one of the most overrated movies of the 1990s while the premise is excellent and a number of the supporting performers especially laura linney and noah emmerich do well in their roles in any staroriented film the final judge of the movies quality must be the star jim carrey ultimately fails to deliver  in yet another example of his unique nonacting acting style he manages to miss or overshoot moments many other actors of lesser stature would hit dead on  what could have been a very powerful movie dealing with the pressures of life and the changes of aging is ultimately reduced to a hollow meaningless study of its star since the material does not allow jim carrey to do that at which he truly excelsoutrageous physical comedyhe looks and feels very stiff and very miscast  watch the movie if you can for its interesting plot sets and supporting performances but try to ignore jim carreys nonperformance,black_comedy
lets not delude ourselves that is all that iconoclastic  prophetic or mind blowing original  in the late 1960s nigel kneale wrote a bbc teleplay called the year of the sex olympics where very similar ideas are explored so the central plot of a man having his whole life manipulated and broadcast to billions of watching people isnt all that clever if youre familiar with the works of nigel kneale i have to confess that while this movie was released in 1998 a couple of years before reality tv saturated the airwaves of western television i had never seen it until a couple of days ago which means my view of this movie especially its plot is prejudiced by a force fed television diet of ordinary people going about their lives so the idea that billions of people watching a man selling insurance comes across as totally ridiculous to me  weve seen big brother become a parody of itself  and has been parodied in the recent series of doctor who  while other similar shows have suffered from slipping ratings and critical backlash  so it seems ridiculous that billions of people across the globe are compelled to watch a mundane real life show for thirty years not to be totally negative what the producers have done with is structure it correctly where its revealed from the outset that truman burbank is unwittingly living inside a massive tv studio  if the story had been constructed as a m night shymalan type mystery where its revealed to the audience at the end that its all a television show this would have been a disaster  can you imagine the word of mouth giving away the ending  without hammering it home there is a logic to the motives of producing a show like this  product placement  and jim carrey gives a restrained performance and makes truman a sympathetic character  but if its mind blowing prophesy and social commentary you desire then im afraid is inferior to the year of the sex oplympics,black_comedy
i saw this with my friend as a two movie double we walked out of cant hardly wait feeling sore from laughing so hard at how hilarious and great it was intothe pain quickly got worse but not in a happy laughing way i expected this movie to be a great piece of cinematic history but the truth is i was almost asleep by the endi would have to say that the thing that annoyed me most about this movie was that nothing happened honestly i didnt find it exciting at all i know that it wasnt supposed to be an ace ventura bumtalking movie i was prepared for drama but it was just one big letdown,black_comedy
this is a good movie and it couldve been great though unfortunately it wasntfor one the idea for the story was thoughtprovoking intriguing too bad they didnt make the most out of it  thats the feeling i got somehow i felt it couldve been better maybe it was the way it was written who knowsthe acting was well  it was fine enough though i cant honestly say that it was wonderful because ive seen a lot more which was better ed harris was good and jim carrey was ok i guess perhaps all those rave reviews came because people got a revelation with another side of jim carrey in this movie but i think he still has a long way to go still this is a good startthis is a good movie though it couldve been great too bad it wasnt  anyway we can hope for better movies get another great idea then make it  got the first one down now we need movies which follows up both,black_comedy
this movie is not a reflection about the invasiveness of television this is a movie on a man who discovers quite quickly in fact that his own life is a tv show and decides to escape the movie is just the history of how he tries and succeeds to escape a really bad movie,black_comedy
i thought this movie was over rated  once you realize what is going on the movie gets real dull  the idea that someone grew to adulthood without ever leaving the town is ridiculous  with all the hype i thought it would be much better   a more entertaining movie with a tv theme is ed tv,black_comedy
a wonderful concept highly original but unfortunately poorly implemented the sets are good and jim carreys as good as he ever was though  you just feel when you leave the cinema that something was missing  no real beginning and no real end,black_comedy
this is one of those movies that stand the test of time a great premise with great actors the only slight disappointment for me was the ending,black_comedy
after watching i found that it is a great film for people of all ages it is both a comedy and a drama so everyone can get something out of it no matter what they like although there is some language most of the movie is pretty family friendly it also has a great message about reality tv one thing you should look out for though is that the ending scene is very intense and may give children nightmares there is some profanity including the sh word hell and godd although these are very few points in the film and im sure no child would pick it up,black_comedy
i was one of a great many people who saw this movie and were blown away at how original it wasthen a few nights ago while flipping channels i caught the last five minutes of an episode of twilight zone the 1985 the episode ive learned after digging a little was titled special service and was episode 327 airing in 1988 it concerns a regular guy who discovers that his entire life has been orchestrated and broadcast as a cable tv showi guess it just goes to show that all of us who thought man what a twilightzone concept that movie was were more right than we could have knowngrade 7 out of 10 good worth seeing but once will probably do,black_comedy
is an incredible and incredibly surreal film that shows the manipulation of the media its both heartbreaking and heartwarming jim carrey gives a perfect performance with great supporting performances from ed harris and laura linney peter weirs direction is incredible and the music by burkhard dallwitz is also great however the ending felt slightly abrupt and could have kept going for a bit longer,black_comedy
its not coincidental that the main hero was named truman as he is the only true and sincere man in a movie jim carrey in the leading role of truman burbank gave a very convincing performance as well as the supporting cast created the unforgettable images and outlined the contrast this masterpiece is highly recommended to watch,black_comedy
story of truman burbank jim carrey a man who has lived his entire life on tv without ever knowing it everyone he has ever known was an actor and everything in his life has been scripted broadcast 24 hours a day from hundreds of hidden cameras in the largest television studio in the world and using a cast and crew of thousands this is the ultimate satire of life in a media fishbowl while he has been provided with an almost perfect existence truman is not entirely happy and he has begun to suspect that something is going on around him and that things may not be what they seemthis is also the story of the audience and their dependence on this real life soap opera that has been broadcast everyday for over 10000 straight days and finally it is a story about the media as personified by christof ed harris who has become the ultimate manipulator of lifeat the heart of the picture we have a well told story from screenwriter andrew nichol who would be nominated for an oscar and directed by peter weir also oscar nominated and one of his 6 oscar nominations four of which were for direction both plot and character are given considerable attention here so we follow incidents but also the affects these developments have upon the charactersthe title role is well played by carrey who gives his most restrained performance up to that time laura linney gives another strong supporting performance and ed harris seems perfectly cast as the creator and master manipulator of this all encompassing media event and for which he would be oscar nominated,black_comedy
i asked a friend to describe he said no its not a comedy wellnot exactly i didnt quite understand until i watched it myself truman takes on a tone quite different than any parodycomedies ive seen lately the point the media and its destructive powers is subtlely relayed through dark humor and you dont feel like the director is smashing you over the head with his morals peter weir demonstrated his artistic genius in dead poets society and here as well the soundtrack is great ed harris is stellar what were they thinking at the academy and for once i actually liked jim carrey his performance wasnt ribald for once the final scenei will not reveal itis a majestic longawaited finish to an intellectual movie some people will insist that it was boring or pointless those are the same viewers who prefer slapstick obvious humor to the subtle layers presented here this is a thinking persons movie if you cant see the underlying message here of course you wont like it,black_comedy
as many fans know jim carrey is the man when it comes to slapstick comedy his comical physicality is outrageous and his ability to emulate anything from cartoons to other actors is top notch but anytime before 1998 i think i can safely say that not many people saw carrey try and jump out of his shell and try a role that wasnt truly in the comedy genre i definitely didnt see it coming and to be honest i wasnt sure if i would really enjoy it but in the end i did not only because of how well carrey portrayed his character but with an excellent story to back if up,black_comedy
this movie talks about a person named truman who is being fooled because he thought that what hes seeing and the world hes living in is his real world unfortunately he doesnt know that hes the most famous person in the world and hes life is a television show being played live for 24 hours without interruptions like commercial and such hes actually living a life full of lies he doesnt even got the chance to live as the person he really is this movie is amazing and breathtaking because of the scenes this will make you realize that not everything you see is real this also shows how technology and media affects a persons life on the audience perspective whos been watching truman for decades seems realistic because of the scenery the place sky and the settings the ending left us all hanging because we doesnt have an idea what happened when truman already left the studio and got to see the real world and lauren the love of his life this is a must watch movie the efforts of the cast and staff is worth it because the result of the movie is successful,black_comedy
this movie talks about a person named truman being fooled because he thought that what hes seeing and the world hes living in is his real world unfortunately he doesnt know that hes the most famous person in the world and that his life is just a television show being played 24 hrs live with no interruptions like commercials and such its like his whole life is a lie lol this movie is amazing this movie makes you realize that not everything you see is real this also shows how technology and media can affect a persons life also when youre the audience of that television show and youre going to review it on the audience perspective the television show seems realistic because the scenery the place the sky and everything that you see in that show looks real this is a must watch movie the efforts of the cast and staff is worth it because you can see that the movie is successful,black_comedy
is jim carrey as you have never seen him before this is straight out of the twilight zonein fact writer andrew nicchol based the screenplay on an episode of the twilight zone jim carrey plays an insurance salesman who has no idea that his entire life is scripted and part of a television show this is a departure of sorts for peter weir also and though i have forgotten much of this film i remember liking it a lot there are many underlying themes and the entire presentation is something you dont see often this is a healthy recommendation regardless of whether you are a fan of carrey or not,black_comedy
has proved to remain updated throughout already two decades exposing the world to themes like following your dreams and never stopping to get to them this idea is exposed in an idea that could be inspired by platos cave but with a modern twist based on how ignorant people can be in ones surroundings the exposure of consumerisms still remains a mirror towards todays society the cinematography utilized to mimic the hidden cameras is brilliant making the movie an amazing analysis for philosophical viewers and a fun movie for casual ones,black_comedy
i was expecting some overrated jim carrey movie but this one is really good and i love it,black_comedy
the movie is a good one and can still be a very good lesson for todays audiences a lot of our society could still be considered the target relating back to things such as reality television the shows of even today are idyllic and display an improperly perfect version of our society the same could be said for those who create video blogs or vlogs and videograph the best parts of their lives as if that is all of itit was almost aggravating to watch considering how much i wanted truman to realize the truth of his reality and speak out about it it made me both sad and mad to watch the movie because of how it felt like a cruel joke against him to me but despite that i really enjoyed the movie the way the movie shows the reactions of those watching is a very good addition in my opinionthe irony of the audience knowing that trumans life is fake but him not knowing is the most essential part of the movie though it could have been shot entirely inside the set of seahaven with the audience realizing that it is a television show set along with or slightly before truman it would have been a far different movie than what it actually is and watches like it is hard to say whether that lack of irony would improve the movie or not as it is such a stark difference,black_comedy
that rare cinematic experience a movie so close to pure perfection that it seems a shame to spoil it by even reading a review beforehand,black_comedy
jim carry deserved an oscar for this film but yeah they dont give oscar to a comedian actor this film is all about jim carrys acting you are living a happy life and suddenly you find out that your life is not your life everything has been scripted in your life then what happen what will you do,black_comedy
is flawless in every sense of the world its a metaphor for everything for so much of what is wrong with the world its a commentary on what people want what they crave and how they operate it deals with how much power one person can have over another how you cant keep a person from being independent there are many that say that the end of the movie was a copout that he should have gotten revenge i say it is completely perfect the way it is it proves that the most basic human instinct is to know to learn and to be independent so many movies try to be revolutionary to be a metaphor for life and fall woefully short sometimes its because the metaphor doesnt speak the way it should sometimes its simply because the quest for profoundness has stripped the movie of its entertainment value this movie does neither it speaks volumes but its still entertaining and i dont think there is a movie ending that moves me to tears quite as frequently i dont think there ever will be,black_comedy
as a satire this movie was decent as a movie for pure entertainment purposes it had a weak plot and no real climax point there were many places where satire was seen in this movie the first satirical element we saw was irony when truman agreed to take part in a job that he needed to take the ferry to get to except he was prepared to go and then he did the exact opposite walk off the pier and not go this was a good example of dramatic irony i think that the target of this satire is reality television there are many similarities between and reality television such as both give others insight on peoples lives through television and both are a little too invasive in the stars life especially because the people can watch truman for 24 hours if theyd like to because the target of this satire is reality television it could be said that is merely an inflation of reality tv to show people the problems that are present in reality tv shows truman as a baby and you get to see him grow up most have been watching him his whole life and in reality tv when there are child stars like kendall and kylie jenner who have been on reality tv from a young age the audience watches them grow up as well just takes it to the extreme reality tv and are also similar in the fact that they dont want the stars to leave so they create obstacles in reality tv the obstacle that most stars face when trying to get out of the limelight is media backlashloss of fame both of these things can be very hard to face thats why the star will continue to be a star and make their boss company money the obstacle for truman is that he is terrified of water this fear was instilled in him by the producers of his show made so that even if he wanted to leave he would be too scared because seahaven is surrounded by water,black_comedy
in we follow the life of truman someone who was adopted by a film corporation at birth and lives as the focus of the most famous reality tv show without even knowing it this show is on 247 following every little detail of trumans life his little town is all he knows and for years he is okay with it since he is the star of the show he is the center of attention of the town eventually this fact sticks out to him truman starts to figure out that something isnt right and decides to do something about it he tries to escape but he encounters many obstacles keeping him on the tv shows island this movie inflates the idea of how far we will go for our own pleasure in the movie the whole world knows about the tv show that the main actor is being watched 247 without knowing it and that his life is being controlled by the cast and directors yet they do nothing about it in fact they dont want to do anything about it they enjoy it truman has no privacy but no one seems to care it must be alright since they are getting entertainment out of it right the movie also uses irony to convince the audience of flaws in our society when truman is struggling in his life he turns to his best friend who talks to him using the directors words spoken to him over his earpiece one of the most ironic line in the movie in my opinion was when trumans best friend turns to him during a serious conversation and says the last thing i would ever do is lie to you this is ironic because of course as he says this he is lying he is trying to convince truman that he is just thinking crazy thoughts and everything is normal when he actually knows that the whole world is watching is life play out really makes us reflect on our lives how far do we go for our own pleasure it uses many satirical elements to convince us of this flaw at first while watching the movie we find it crazy and overthetop at this worlds crazy idea of reality tv when we stop and think about it it makes us wonder how farfetched it really is,black_comedy
is still pertinent and significant to todays society because it addresses the power of the media it targets people who watch reality tv and producers in the way that they try and gain viewers is a horatian satire because it addresses a group of people as a whole and it was humorous many uses of the language of satire was found within this film the use of inflation overstated how reality show effects society their corporation adopted truman and placed him into a fake society almost how reality tv stars are basically living in fake societies the use of situational irony showed how everyone watching knew that truman was on a show but he didnt the use of deflation understated how commercialism is so ingrained into our society they made it seem like it was no big deal when advertising things in front of truman has a great cast and a great plot but i feel that it was more of a science fictiondramacomedy movie before a satire i understand the undertones of the satire addressing reality tv but i think that the movie wasnt really to make you think about reality tv in todays society but the idea of reality tv in the future,black_comedy
is one of jim carreys most successful comedy films along with dumb and dumber the mask ace ventura and liar liar however this movie is the most well received by the film critics and earning an 8110 on imdb and a 94 on rotten tomatoes as well as a 90 on metascore but nobody gives a damn about metascore so its no wonder that some people are still thinking about watching the movie and reading reviews and one of those people used to be me once and im surprised youre reading my reviews out of all the ones im glad youre reading this and ill try to give you the best effort for a review possible so you can see whether youd like this movie or notcan be interpreted as a basic comedy movie to pass time by some but it can also be interpreted as a misunderstood masterpiece because of the specializing in cinematography subtlety and wittiness in the subject of tv shows in reality tv shows people like truman live in them for basically the entirety of their lives and the only difference is that they are fully aware that they have been living in one while truman is completely unaware however truman begins to gain suspicion after strange events happen and he begins to suspect things while we as the viewer are completely aware that the strange events are because of the fact that he is in a tv show as usual jim carrey brings his humorous characteristics as he reacts to these strange situations such as product placement coincidental happenings and bad luck and we as the viewer are amused when we watch him in these situations because we know he is in a tv show while these situations are funny they are actually very thoughtprovoking and they may question your life itself and how the process of reality tv shows work and whether or not the actors in coronation street are like truman  except that they are selfaware of it being a tv show we then watch these tv shows with heaps of effort and we enjoy them however are we really to care of the impact of tv shows after an episode we just flick it onto another channel until dinner is readystill not sure whether you will like this or not well if you are a big fan of jim carreys outrageous but intelligent humour then i think you will enjoy this movie while this is a lot more subtle and thoughtprovoking in terms of humour than jim carreys previous comedies it still sticks to the humour we know and love from jim carrey however on a lower volume than it is usually played if you are a fan of thoughtprovoking cynical satires then i think you will enjoy this film as well if you are a fan of good cinematography techniques then i think youll enjoy analyzing this film if you simply want to watch a good film then watch this if you are not a fan of jim carrey satire cinematography or good films then this film is not for you simply put this film is a comedic masterpiece that may be to some tastes and below others depending on the type of films you usually take interest in but for me it was a delightful treat that just whizzed past my expectations,black_comedy
i remember watching this film when i was younger not understanding anything until the end of the film when he crashed the boat into the wall now i got a whole different story and i loved it even more than the first time truman is a man who has been imprisoned without knowing it for many years and is the biggest star of the outer world people have followed his life since the his birth to this day it starts off with truman clueless of what is going on but the fake world around him is starting to catch up with him and he suspects something isnt right and when he meets a girl in the library she lets the secret out she takes him to the beach to let him know everything but its not long before the actors are called in to save the show this time a man playing a dad to the girl who saves everything by saying she is mentally ill and drives her away truman is left with nothing but questions and an ambiguous mind hes doubting everything questioning everything and starts to think he is going insane the director of the show is well prepared and got everything figured out to keep truman in the pretend world that is reliant on the smartest move of them all was probably making him and his dad go sailing killing the dad by creating a storm and drown the dad and that would sooner lead to a phobia of water very clever since the town is surrounded by water which would make truman stay there forever the hidden subjects about the higher powergod ownership of our own life and ethics was in the back of my mind throughout the whole film it would be unethical to keep someone imprisoned like that not only that but to share his life with the whole world showing no respect or giving truman privacy the idea of the story that the film is built upon is truly phenomenal so intriguing i cant imagine what i would have done if i found out i was the star of a show like,black_comedy
remind me of the story zhuangzhou dreamt of butterfly we never know whether we are living in the true world whether there is someone spying on us all the time whether our lives are directed by othersnow that we can not figure it out why do we always care about others views about us just be youself,black_comedy
what to say about this film which could influence you to consider watching this film well the honest answer is to consider for a moment if you have thought to yourself did anyone see that or i wish that was caught on film as it would have made good tv in modern society with smartphones every day we are coming close to constant streaming of life in motion i think that this film was before its time in many ways good performance by all actors in this film and i liked the product placement to move the production forward to the green light at that timeif you enjoy this film then you got the good taste,black_comedy
is one of those rare films that stand out all on their own its an interesting twist on telling a story about ones life you would think this couldnt work but it diddirector peter weir gets full credit for doing this right starring jim carrey ed harris laura linney and noah emmerich this was perfectly cast with a note on the great performance by jim carrey for a comedian he really came out of his wheelhouse for this role and nailed itits a 910 from me,black_comedy
here i am watching this in 2017 and spellbound by such beautiful work i never knew a movie could quite be like this if youve never seen this movie you need to see it its not a comedy but its not the drama exactly its life pure and simple life and the awakening to the fact that maybe its not what you thought it was maybe its a commentary on midlife crisis cease or maybe its a commentary on the modernday prevalence of reality tv you could take it either way or you can take it for what it is a story that sings,black_comedy
is not only a great original movie but probably jim carreys best performance the film is about an ordinary man who figures out his entire life was a lie and he was being filmed the whole time in a reality tv show with paid actors this film is probably one of the most original ideas and i think most people can relate to at certain times of their lives and has spawned movies that are close in idea i would give an 810 and i believe the film deserved at least one oscar for the amount of work and creativity put on the film,black_comedy
is a fantasy film that was released back in 1998 the first thing that caught my attention was the concept of this film the concept of this film was related to the influence of media in everyday life is about a person called truman burbank who lives in a small island called seahaven near the coast of florida where nothing really happens everything in life almost perfect but certain events of the past often disturb his feelings towards the life he lives the sudden turn of events and suspicious happenings around him makes him more curious to discover the world he lives in therefore truman sets out on his voyage to unlock the mysterious happenings and seeks for the answers to his questions the first person to be credited is story writer andrew niccol who also coproduced this film his writing showed futuristic thinking and thought provoking ideas that were quite absent at that time zone director peter weir should be given a huge congratulation for taking up this story and delivering it in great fashion which entertaining engaging thought provoking and heartwarming at the end the film starts in a slow pace as editing were quite sloppy and elevation of scenes which potentially confuses its viewers as time went on the introductory of characters and comic timing of the dialogues really pulled me into whole scenario of weird behaviors of each and every character in the film the curiosity to know the answers to trumans questions slowly crept into me and the only reason could be the ever relateable trumans character to real life and again full credits had to go to peter weir for creating a great character that could gain our sympathythe next thing which i was really impressed with is the dialogues of this film which was cojointly written by andrew niccol and peter weir the dialogues in the film really worked well with every character in the film especially in the comedy department that gave good laughs throughout the film coming to the backbone of this film jim carrey who absolutely carried this film as his child jim carrey lived as truman in this film the smartness stupidity and curiosity were shown in his ever expressive face and the ambiance of his expressions could be felt throughout the film which made it a more amazing experience jim carrey was the only actor that could pull off this role with such perfection hats offsupporting casts in the film like noah emmerich and ed harris had important roles in the film and played them really well the more important among them was ed harris character in the film a sense of seriousness enters the screen every time he shows up just because of his menacing and hard look throughout the film the cast is roundly superb even if the majority of them are in minor roles the cinematography of peter biziou was great all along my favorites were the scenes at the sea and aerial shots at night the editing of this film was good overall despite feeling slightly off place and sloppy at times the only reason is the inconsistent screenplay of this film especially in the first hour some scenes were elevated in a slow pace which made the film a bit lengthy this is the only drawback in this filmoverall is a mind boggling futuristic piece of film making that is thought provoking and entertaining at the same time it might not have won anything at the academy awards but it certainly won hearts of millions watching it this is one of those movies which is a classified classic certainly worth watching a few times hats off to the makers,black_comedy
this film opens my door to the magic world i watched several times at different ages and i gained new things every time this is the first time i realize a real good story can really peek you from inside its not only talking to you but also talking about you it stands with me forever,black_comedy

just watched this film last night and found that it is such a great file that i cant understand why i have missed it for so longi would put it in the same tie with the matrix 1999 the concepts in both movies are similar and more importantly came out before the matrix diddunno why there was not a single academy award for this great movie i just love it and couldnt stop thinking about itjust one question about it a little spoiler in it but when truman was sitting in the beach why was the rain falling on himself only but not anything else if the crews purpose is to make truman believe in the world he was living in they shouldnt have made this error should they i mean if i were part of the weather crew i would downpour the beach area where truman was sitting from the movie it looked to be an important prompt for truman to realize that there was a plot around him the crew has been controlling all this for about 30 years and it is hardly believable that they would have made such a stupid errorby the way i found the director character christol is quite likable i happened to find he was also the marine general in the rock 1996 the opening speech by him in front of the marine cemetery was touching and the following mutiny his command staged was pretty impressive,black_comedy
when hit theaters in the summer of 1998 there was no such thing as survivor big brother amazing race or jersey shore the fact that the film beat america to the realitytv punch shows how much of a landmark production it truly wasfor a basic plot summary tells the story of truman burbank jim carrey a regular guy who begins to suspect that his life is being controlled by forces outside of his own without giving away any major spoilers suffice it to say that after witnessing some strange behavior from his wife laura linney best friend noah emmerich and old flame natascha mcelhone truman starts putting the pieces together and ultimately discovers how manipulated his life truly istruman show is a concept movie throughandthrough it really nails the concept of reality tv  just how pervasive commercialism can become in our society as mentioned in the opener this film was years ahead of its time in portraying such issues as such the film resonates more today than it ever could have in 98the acting helps the production rise above the concept as well carrey though always typecast as dumb or ace type roles turns in an oscarworthy performance as the befuddled truman while the auxiliary roles are finelytuned also director peter weir will have you truly caring about the little town of seahaven island and its inhabitants by the films conclusionthus i consider to be one of the better movie productions of alltime it has everything a great movie needsintriguing plot good pacing solid acting malleable characters and even a little humor thrown in here and there this is a film that can be enjoyed if not right away understand in the case of the kiddies by the entire family,black_comedy

i dont know why i really should bother writing the 915th review of this film on imdb but such is the power of that i saw myself left with no choice but to to put it in simplistic terms this film is nighon perfect there is no fault with this film and if anyone finds a fault with it i would love to be informed of said fault to see if it is really a fault jim carrey gives the best performance of the year with maybe the exception of roberto benigni in life is beautiful as truman burbank perfectly portraying the paranoia and strife a man in such dire circumstances must go through ed harris is enigmatic and scenestealing as christof and honestly i think it is one of the bestwritten parts in the last twenty years of cinema the rest of the cast are excellent too ranging from laura linney as an actress who knows that is her big break to paul giamatti in a very small role in the real world andrew niccols script is one of the best ever in hollywood on par with paddy chayefskys network and quentin tarantinos pulp fiction peter weirs direction is brilliant but i now find myself contradicting what i earlier said about there being no faults with this film the only fault with this film is that they didnt go far enough i read in the trivia section on imdb that peter weir planned to have the film cut the screen shows people watching the film in the theater through a security webcam and then keep going on with the film this would have been amazing and we are left with only wishful thinking of what mightve been several other deleted scenes one being a jogger portrayed by an actor who two days previous had played a homeless man in a wheelchair would have elevated this film from nighon perfect to as important as network or dare i say citizen kane in one of the strongest years in film this film was almost thrown into the gutter and forgotten about at the academy awards i need not tell you how much of a disgrace it is carrey didnt win for best actor and niccol win for best original screenplay thank god everyone else on imdb agrees with me that this film is outstanding except with its current ranking of 207 i am also disappointed because really it should be top 2530 this film contains many subtle messages from schizophrenia to the power the media holds in our society and it is very difficult to choose what moment is best except i think i have it at the very end and in case anyone didnt see the banner at the top spoiler alert when truman exits his alternate reality and the show ends we see two men discuss what to watch next so seamlessly as if they have to watch something this is the best moment of the film because it shows our complete lack of care for truman and that once something ends that we have devoted time to watching it we must go and begin to watch something else this film is difficult to comprehend with one viewing but once you appreciate its power its subtleties and its satirical messages then you will relate to this review,black_comedy
is a satirical movie about a man named truman he is trapped beneath a bubble and is being filmed for a popular tv show everyone around truman knows they are being filmed and knows that they are underneath this dome everythings to be going smoothly until one day when truman finds a girl and it is love at first she tells him the truth that everything is fake and everyone is pretending she is then whisked away by her dad her dad then mentions that they are moving to fiji flash forward a few years and truman is out of high school and questioning everything around him he then suddenly wants to go to fiji and find this girl when truman tries to leave there is always something that stops him from going anywhere this is of course where the producers of the show come into play and the question of whether the show is treating truman like a human being one second it is that all the flights are booked the next is the traffic and then there is a hazardous waste spillage on the road out of town and he is tackled and subdued back into his own personal house the directors sit there and feed lines to all of the people around the place to make sure that truman never goes anywhere bringing his father back from the dead whenever truman decided that he really wanted to leave they cut the stream for the first time ever and made it so that no one would know what is going on behind the scenes he was so determined to leave at the end of the story they have to almost kill him to keep him in the dome in the end truman is confronted by the director of this whole story and he is told the truth he has a very important choice to make will he stay in the dome and continue entertaining or will he leave,black_comedy
truman burbank thinks he is an ordinary person doing an ordinary job in a fairly ordinary town he does not realise that he is the star of a reality show he has lived in the town of seahaven all of his life never suspecting that cameras are watching his every move and that everybody else including his wife mother and his friends are merely cast members and that the town itself is under a giant dome strange things occasionally happen but excuses are quickly made for example a falling spotlight is explained away as something that fell from a plane from an early age truman has been conditioned so that he wont try to leave the town the drowning of his father gave him a terror of the sea and any time he thinks about leaving an obstacle appears eventually he starts to realise that something is wrong and decides that he must leave to prove that he isnt paranoidis a fine satire of reality television made when the genre was just starting the idea that truman might live for thirty years before he realises something isnt right with his world might seem unlikely at first but one has to remember that this reality is all that he has ever known jim carrey can be a bit annoying at times but here he is on top form and gives one of his best performances as the eponymous truman he manages to be funny without being silly and makes the viewer sympathise with truman ed harris is also impressive as christof the creator of the show who has directed trumans entire life and is determined that the show must go on the reality of trumans world is fun with lots of digs at modern media characters talk as though they are in commercial which of course they are and a travel agents shop is decorated with posters guaranteed to put you off flying there are also touching moments such as truman falling for an extra who is quickly taken off to fiji by her father not only do we see what is happening to truman we are shown the fans of the show who are obsessed with his life which emphasises just how public trumans life is overall i strongly recommend this the concepts may be quite dark but it is presented in such a way that it can be enjoyed by people of all ages,black_comedy
is a great satirical piece staged within a giant dome truman lives his life alongside actors and he is the only one that doesnt know he is star during the video he begins to figure out that his life is a lie he ends up escaping in a boat overcoming his fears to find freedom is a representation of the control media has over our lives wherever we go we are surrounded by it in the show there are a couple of occurrences in which people try to alert truman of the control the media has over him in response the character is removed and the media tries to destroy their credibility later on truman is able to avoid the cameras by covering some of the cameras and pretending to sleep creating a gateway to escape the directors of the movie not the show are able to create some sense of freedom showing how escaping the prying eyes of the public and media allowed him to have his own liberties and control his life near the end of the movie as truman is trying to escape christof the director with a god complex tries to scare truman into going back to the city and living a normal life instead he chooses to die rather than living as a slave and continues on his path but he survives in one of his final lines truman says you never had a camera in my head in response to christof stating that he knew truman better than he did himself the accuracy of how the media feels it is in control was brought to mind by the techniques used by the directors of the movie overall is a great satirical piece helping to bring its audience into the realization of the effect and control the media has over them,black_comedy
is an interesting story about a man named truman who has spent his entire life in a literal bubble with all of his friends and family actually being actors for a television show just about his life as the story progresses the satire of the story becomes obvious the satire of is the amount of manipulation that the media goes through in order to produce something for their audiences the producers built an entire town for truman ruined lives and psychologically scarred truman with the death of his father another interesting point concerning is the way that nothing is truly fake its just manipulated most of the characters had genuine emotions concerning truman but they were fed their lines as to manipulate the scenes in the way that the producers wanted for it to go also brings up the private vs public life argument celebrities are often struggle long and hard for a private life this causes damage to relationships for those celebrities illustrates that with the fact that the television show is 247 truman is watched while sleeping while brushing his teeth and while they do panaway during restroom scenes we hope one of the goals that the producers have is the first ever live conception has many different satires targeting a wide range of topics surrounding the spectrum of media influence,black_comedy
to quickly explain the movie for those who have not seen it or dont know the basic plot truman is a a huge celebrity on a tv show unbeknownst to him everyone in his daily life even his mom wife and best friend are all actors on the show throughout the movie he begins picking up on clues like actors telling him its a tv show the same actors walking around the block over and over again for no reason and the fact that somehow everyone seems to know what hes doing where hes going and stops him whenever truman does something thats out of his character i personally thought that was a fantastic movie for many reasons i find it interesting that the movie is so unlike any other movie ive seen for the movie itself almost appears to be while it messes with your mind a little it really makes you think about what true reality is i also liked the overall theme of the movie that we accept the reality that is given to us its an interesting concept that could be applied to our lives today making it a great movie and theme for people even todaynot only did i like the movie for those reasons but is also an excellent example of satirical techniques and devices its easy to identify dramatic irony in the beginning as the audience knows that truman is in a tv show while he does not its also ironic that the character truman seems to have a sense of freedom although he couldnt be more confined the audience can also see deflation and inflation two very important satire devices deflation is apparent through the demoralizing of human life in comparison to corporate success and inflation is obvious through the exaggerated use of props in once scene a forest fire is instantaneous in the next theres a sudden meltdown at a nuclear plant showing that the producers will do literally anything to stop truman from leaving the island i would highly suggest this movie for anyone that wants a fun and interesting movie to watch or examples of satirical techniques in media is in my opinion a great movie for anyone to watch especially those who feel trapped in the world theyre presented with,black_comedy
was very enjoyable to watch the show seemed to fulfill a very strong satirical purpose the show evoked fear and made me feel sad giving me the impression that it is juvenalian satire the show had great examples of purpose acceptance of the status quo and morality first the purpose of the show was to make the audience reconsider their opinions on capitalism and our current society watching a large company sell someones life makes one relate to their emotions this gives the impression of a deep impact on the watchers viewpoint and helps them understand the intended impact the viewer finds a relationship to truman and begin to root for him while watching the show this is relating to the humans ethos and deflating the worth of human life second the show has a deeper message about humans as a race generally humans accept what they know and live with the status quo the whole movie all truman knows is the life that he has been shown he takes over 30 years to actually start reaching out and desiring to find new things the system dampered his desires to travel and adventure but he eventually wanted to overcome this tells us that we need to try and go beyond what we accept the directed target seems to big businesses and media yet seems to give direction to the audience as a whole no matter if they are the target last the show makes you question the morality of large businesses as you watch all of the satirical elements and mainly the inflation of a desire for success the viewer begins to question what limit we should hold to capitalism where should morality be weighed against a human desire to win the show was highly entertaining and with the funny moments such as product placement and ironic evident moments of control the show always keeps the viewer interested,black_comedy
a transfixing mindboggling production truman burbank lives in pictureperfect seahaven everything is seemingly immaculate what he doesnt know is that every moment and aspect of his life is set up and being watched and scrutinized his entire life is being documented on secret little cameras everywhere and on almost everyone he meets his perfect world is a television show running 247 and being watched by billions the connotative language throughout the deeper parts was absolutely moving it made the watcher think about what it would be like for them if they were in that situation and feel horrible for truman the idea of media control is still in todays society we are starting to see some debate over the way the media manipulates public opinion it reflected perfectly how amoral and invasive our culture industry is becoming at the time the movie was produced the world was just beginning to see reality television and today its everywhere and has progressed so much from even the movie it in under the assumption of being another hilarious jim carrey comedy but turned out to be a thoughtprovoking and rewarding film that it is the inflation of the idea of the power abuse of the media was big the morals and the point of the film wasnt overwhelmingly beaten into you the final scene is a much anticipated glorious end to a great movie its nice to have a movie make you think rather than brainlessly watching another reality tv show so in case you dont see it good afternoon good evening and goodnight,black_comedy
is a satirical film that represents the craze of reality television and the medias manipulation of society though the film was made over 18 years ago it is still very relevant today in a giant domed community truman burbank is living a perfect life that revolves around him there are cameras everywhere and everyone including his loved ones are actors the only person who doesnt know his life is a television show is truman in our current society we are heavily influenced by media throughout the film you can draw many connections to the medias influence on our lives the media influences what we believe and what we do with our lives perhaps we are all being controlled under a figurative dome which is being held up by the media also targets reality television as reality television continues to grow in popularity such as keeping up with the kardashians the real housewives duck dynasty jersey shore the movie attacks the connotation of reality in these shows we believe that life can really be like what we see in television even though life is far from what goes on in reality televisionwhile i was young i had liked to think about the concept of what if my life was a television show this made extremely enjoyable as it brought back those memories and truly showed this concept in action the movie contains great humor along with a perfect example of dramatic irony being that truman is the only person that doesnt know his life is a reality tv show overall the movie is very enjoyable as it has a dramatic plot full of humor and entertainment however this movie is far different than others as it requires far more thought about how society is being portrayed in the film,black_comedy
was a very excellent representation of the things in life that people chase but cannot have from the seemingly clich lifestyle truman lives with friendly neighbors a steady job and even the typical adult look with his suit and briefcase truman lives the life that the average american in the 80s would want to have and there is nothing wrong with his life at all but is his life really perfect since meeting his first love nothing in his life has seemed to be quite the same and he wants to know why this movie is a perfectly executed film about how the perfect life is unachievable but his life may not be as great as everyone seems to thinkthe film was very well done a few of the things that the movie did well were the way that it gave the main character truman personality with almost everything he did whether it be his personality quirks or the very catchy things he says almost every part of truman is extremely memorable all of the characters meshed well and had very good acting to go along with it despite being a funny twist on a problem that society faces being the media and the issues with it you do not really find yourself laughing at this movie it takes a tone that really drags you into the thought processes and feelings of truman using dark humor which is hard to catch onto going with the actual movie and its plot many small things fit the movie perfectly to add to the overall experience such as the soundtrack and make the movie really great the greatest part of the film is one that you will really feel upon seeing it and it is the ending no spoilers it was perfectly executed and left a huge lasting impression on me after seeing the film wishing that the movie was not yet over overall the movie was well done with a genius way of presenting a satire if you would like a great movie that will require some thinking to really get involved in this is the movie for you,black_comedy
shows how fake our own media is nowadays news politics advertising and public affairs are increasingly made up of theatrical illusions like our media it is convincing and seems real with lifelike simulations the fake sun that radiates false sincerity of the actor he believes to be his best friend and its flawless there are almost no flaws that give away the illusion until things start to go wrong truman shows the symbiotic relationship we have with media and how we want to leave it but we cant break it off it describes two kind of relationships we have with media we either adore it and have everything to do with it or we dont get involved with it and are repulsed by it the irony is very prominent as this idea is brought up by none other but the medial powerhouse hollywood,black_comedy
is not a movie that one can just casually watch it is a work of satire that manages to provoke thought in the heads of all people through its ability to show how powerful the media is and what impacts it has on societyin order to achieve that message it goes on to inflate the lengths that we would go to entertain by creating a display of horrible ethics in the way that truman was used without knowing or giving consent the whole movie manages to be one big hyperbolic metaphor for the societal problems and manages to strive towards fixing them in a blame by praise format due to the way that they show how great the show is even though they are being incredibly unethical even with the beauty of this films satirical elements the movie managed to show other incredible aspects in the form of jim carrey performing in a more sensible role with none of the slapstick that he is infamous for and the other thing to consider is that the biggest of the movie impact is the popularity of reality television that was sparked by its release and how those shows still dominate a plethora of channels to this very day,black_comedy
was a satire that i feel was aiming to target the way that people choose to live i got to this because of a quote that sounded really strong and powerful it said we choose to live in the world that we are put in i took this as saying that like truman in the film we tend to get stuck in routines by whatever the world throws at us and we dont do anything to try and change it like truman who went into adulthood before finally realizing his whole life has been planned this quote could also hint at the way the media affects how people live reality tv shows have been very popular lately and the fact that there lives are in front of the whole world to see changes them by not doing things to make them happy but doing things to make an audience happy,black_comedy
is a thoughtprovoking film with a deeper analyzation of the coming digital age in the film truman seems like a typical man with an indefectible lifestyle however what soon comes to follow as a shock for truman is that most of his life is a setup and he is the star of a reality tv show trumans suspicions starts as a plethora of deplorable actions from the crew occur from common messups to breaks in character he soon realizes that this is not the life he wants to lead and that theres something more than seahaven the truth one of the more interesting aspects of the movie is the fact that it is actually a very satirical piece the film calls to notice media manipulation it inflates the concept and uses a blame by praise to scrutinize the issue if you do watch this id personally suggest actually looking into and interpreting the deeper meaning rather than just watching the movie without a thought if you are more into carreys funnier movies only manufactured for laughs then i wouldnt suggest this in consideration of the fact that it hits closer to scifi drama and is a lot more than just a comedy all in all it is an interesting movie and definitely one of carreys better works,black_comedy
is the most gripping comedy film i have ever seen not only does it includes funny scenes but also it has emotional scenes at the end directed by peter weir and released in 1998 it stars jim carrey in role of truman burbank it was such a good film that was nominated three times at the oscarsis a reality that will have you on the edge of your seat where the society make fun of one man called truman never in his life he noticed that there were actors pretending he feels as if he was in a real life how baddie can the people be but finally he discovers that his whole life had been a liethe comedy scenes will make you have a lot of fun but also there were emotional scenes that will make you cryi would recommend it to everyone as much as for childrens as for adults it is a film that will make you have a lot of fun and dont forget that after seeing it you would change your mind of the society,black_comedy
is original and provocative movie that has a place in all our hearts jim carrey breaks his typecast funny man role and becomes a more serious character of course there are cute and funny moments but it is just his kindness and casualness that gets the audience cracking up it is not meant to be funny just nice to see so nice the audience cant help but smile the storyline itself is original and suspenseful it is not meant to be a thriller it just happens to be excitingthis was before the days of reality tv nowadays almost everything is reality tv everybody in reality shows know theyre being filmed but what if they did not what if literally everything somebody did was being broadcasted to the world 247 that is just what is about jim carrey plays truman who has had a camera on him since birth he lives on the island he grew upon which is completely fake ever since he was a kid they have tried everything they can to keep him on that island even going so far as having his father drown to discourage him from ever sailing off actors play his friends sand is fake and everything on the island is controlled it is amazing to see all of this and freaky how possible it all is too the filming of trumans every move may seem boring but the world loves it all as the title character is oblivious and goes about his life as an average joe after all truman just works at a bank like thousands of others sympathy grows towards truman but his life is so full of joytruman is in his thirties and has had a camera on him in his fake world all his life after a while would there not be malfunctions or mistakes it all starts when he sees his father being taken away on a bus there have been subtle clues his whole life but nothing he really gave a second look at as truman really starts checking out anything unusual excitement grows as we have no idea what will happen to truman will he escape will he stay the ending is something that may be small but really has an impactno matter how you classify it was always be near the top44,black_comedy
this is the kind of movie that you will remember for the rest of your lives even though i am no fan of jim carrey i thought he played truman burbank perfectly going in to the movie i was aware of the premise that truman was oblivious to the fact that his life was a tv show however i didnt know that everybody in his town was actually an actor i thought sea haven was just a normal town not a set once i become accustomed what was actually going on i started to relish every second of this great movie there is nothing wrong with this movie it has humor drama and a fresh script everything you would want in a movie,black_comedy
the first time i saw this movie i was young it was on tv and at this time i didnt know the name of the film or was interested in the movie industry that is why it took me a couple of years to find that movie again in these years when i was searching for this movie i didnt remember many things except the feeling i had when i watched it i wasnt able to describe it but i felt like i needed to watch that movie again not many movies give me that strange impression that i had and im pretty sure it was the first one that is why truman show is for me a classic it is unique im not judging it in any way except for the story and what i feel when im watching or even thinking about it,black_comedy
is a perfect example of how much money a high concept movie can make its also a textbook case of how shallow a high concept movie can be if you dont find the right structure to express the inherent themes that this movie is being heralded as the most original of summer 98 says more about the sad state of creativity in mainstream hollywood and the need to sell magazines than it does about the quality of this filmmost screenwriters know that high concept is essential for a script to succeed in mainstream movies what most dont know is that high concept only gives you two or three fun scenes then you have to know how to develop the high concept through opposition and theme to get two hours of great writingis a story of a man who discovers that his entire life is a television show this puts us in the realm of social fantasy an advanced form of fiction that allows the writer to compare social worlds fantasy always involves two tracks the fantasy world and the real world it is commenting upon without the real world reference the fantasy story is clinically interesting as an act of creativity but never compellingwhen you look at the structure the writer chose for you see immediately why this movie was doomed to blow most of its immense potential instead of starting in the mundane world then going to the fantasy world  as most great fantasies do  the writer chose to have the hero  and the audience  slowly discover that he is living in a fantasy world that makes the hero a kind of detective solving the mystery of his own lifethis choice appears at first glance to be a good one audiences love a mystery because mysteries give us a clean desire line and a lot of reveals and a detective story where a man solves the mystery of his own life is a brilliant premiseproblemneed but the reality here is much different the socalled comingtoawareness structure causes you to start your hero as a clean slate hes quite happy with his life before things fall apart but this means you cannot detail your heros need whether psychological or moral up front since need is the wellspring of any good story and the source of the selfrevelation this is a serious loss truman is portrayed from the beginning as little more than an impossibly cheerful optimistdesire the detective structure in this case also gives the hero the lowest of all possible desire lines to escape by ending the film with the moment he breaks out of his trap the author guarantees that this low desire will structure the entire story and that has a devastating effect on plot instead of giving us lots of great reveals we have only one repeated time and again i am caught in a fictional world opponent using the detective structure also diminishes the opponent in the detective class i talk about the negative effects of hiding the opposition the most serious drawback is that we have no opportunity to contrast the values of the hero and opponent until the end when it is too late for detailing and texture in the director is nothing but an omniscient presence until the end of the film when he spouts a few platitudes about truman being the star of his own worldsince the opponent in a social fantasy also stands for a larger alternative world the detective structure makes it impossible to have a deeper comparison between this safe fictional world and the freer real world outsidea look at the premiere american social fantasy on film its a wonderful life shows how important the right structure is to making the larger themes pay off its a wonderful life uses an elaborate storytelling structure in order to give us the centerpiece of the film which is an immediate and highly detailed juxtaposition of the same town under two different sets of values gives us only one version of the world for the full two hoursbattle selfrevelation no wonder then that the battle and selfrevelation are anticlimactic and stale truman gets smashed in the boat by an all powerful director and has a simple selfrevelation  id rather be free  that was a foregone conclusion from the first revealsocial fantasy is among the most challenging and satisfying of all story forms especially in film but it requires a mastery of craft and theme to fulfill its massive potential finding a great high concept premise is the single most important factor in successful hollywood screen writing and it certainly made everyone associated with this film a lot of money but it is not enough for great writingfor more reviews please visit wwwtrubycom,black_comedy
peter weirs earliest major films the last wave picnic at hanging rock are studies of people overwhelmed by circumstances they cant understand or control but his later films offer hope of redemption and triumph like dead poets society is the story of struggle for freedom from an oppressive system while dps was an interesting development of a standard situation a liberalminded teacher helps students free their minds from tradition through creative literature is based on a very unique setup the main character truman burbank is the only true man in a tvshow world of actors and commercial advertising we the viewers discover this truth before he does because weir introduces us to a selection of viewers who are hooked on the show the film holds our interest by showing us first trumans process of discovery and then his attempts to escape his situationa lot has been made out of the supposed religious elements of presumably because of the christofchrist name parallel a bit too cute dont you think but to turn the film into a religious allegory misses the obvious the film is about the line between fake and real and how television destroys humanity by hooking us on images in order to sell products the key line in the film is truman to christof you never had a camera in my head you cant say that about god second the real christ was a rebel as in the confrontation with the moneychangers who was killed by the system if you want a christ image in its truman walking on water at the end of the film not the lord of commercialism chillingly played by ed harrisif theres a deeper philosophical message in the film it has to be the rejection of the postmodern idea of how we know what we know truman lives in a world thats been created for him a postmodernist ie pretty much anyone teaching in the literature or history department of my university would say that we accept the world were given what we know to be true is what we are told is true my truth depends entirely on the culture i live in and the categories of thought im provided with on this basis truman should never escape seahaven but human intellect and curiosity exist precisely to question and change categories of thought so trumans quest for the truth involves observing both anomalies a falling stage light odd patches of rain where there should be consistency and patterns bicycle flowers beetle where there should be randomness he persists until he finds a way out of the world of image into the real world out of the fake light sky and clouds into the black door of whatever is out there the tragedy is that the commercial world of television needs us not to find our way out so the very last image of is not the hero escaping but the viewers saying so what else is on,black_comedy
i think that was a great film purely because i have never seen one like it it really made me think about the real world and that it is maybe not so good to have everything perfect in this film the main character jim carrey was very controlled and likable compared to other movies he has stared in such as the mask and ace venturathis movie is about a man called truman who has been put in a fake world since birth and everyone around him is acting this world is placed in the middle of hollywood and everyone is watching him from their tv setsi think the main point the director was trying to put across was that maybe the perfect world would not be a good place to live eg nothing exciting and new happens i think the director was successful with thisthis film is very good and i would recommend it to anyone who likes jim carreys acting style,black_comedy
surely  one of the best movies i have ever seen the plot is surprising excellent  made me cry just now best part is when the boat hits the false ceiling and he makes his choicefreedomcouragebetter to know whats behind the door better to suffer but knowing the truthto face the fears what a challengelove the movie it is a surprise to see and enjoy jim carrey interpreting not a comedy role  ed harrisalways greata movie to see over and over a movie to buy and keep in a best movies collectionmy very best i personally compare it with  the hours  and magnolia  arent they great ,black_comedy
okayi just seen this recentlya couple of weeks ago and it apparently did not leave a lasting impression on meit is not a memorable jim carrey movieit is mediocre at bestnot a memorable classic like the mask and ace ventura seriesit is rather a spinoff of comedian goes to drama documentary style projects that are not meant to leave lasting or meaningful impacts of memorable sorts the men in the control room are not convincing in their roles and they are not to be known in fond terms of myself as a viewer of this barely mediocre jim carrey projectespecially at the end where the guy with the glasses acts like hes a god and starts almost appearing that way as we hear his voice being broadcast towards careys charactertruman and proceeds with his unforgettable line ofwellwhy dont you say something nowtrumansay something goddammit i hated that parthe reminded me of the typical sinister puppetmaster mindset of the very flawed corporate self righteous scum of the countrythat guy really needed a swift kick by jet li into his stupid ugly mug if i must say so myself anywayi guess it had its points but basically very much more towards being a forgetable and flawed project highlighted by stupid godwannabee characters like that stupid jerk with the glasses at the end i liked carreys response to that jerk thoughthe way he kept his cool and proceeded with his exploited life so gracefully and sportsmanly as he did was poetry in motion if i must say so myself for its pointscarreys usual versatile acting abilitieswhich resonated and made up for the wannabee jerks and had a redeeming quality in itselfi give this one a 60100 if you like to see jerks put in theyre place and are able to overlook flawfull acting and truly unmeaningfull attributes of a good film then give it a tryi guess peace out,black_comedy
this film would not normally inspire me to write anything but i am astonished to find it listed in the top 100 films ever as rated on this site and disappointed to find that the majority of peoples reason for rating it so highly is the mere concept behind the film a few years back this would have been truly imaginative but we live in the age of jennicam when i saw that the film was coming out my reaction was sort of ah yes i wondered when this film would show up when do we get a bigbudget cloning nightmare film in the wake of dolly the sheep maybe we have and i missed it im not counting multiplicitymy friend who arrived late for the film didnt know the premise and spent most of the film trying to work out why trumans life was so peculiar which he says made it very entertaining since i knew what the film was about and it unfolded before me exactly as i expected i found it somewhat less inspiring im not saying its bad jim carreys performance is very good but please a bit of perspective6510,black_comedy
1st watched 2121999  8 out of 10dirpeter weir unique story well told and acted  first somewhat dramatic role for jim carrey turned out ok but the story itself it what carries this picture carrey has been picking unique oneofakind movies of late,black_comedy
i am not a jim carrey fan  his performance on one of the mtv award shows a few years ago was a prime motivator in my having that channel removed from my cable service  i rented at the urging of my teenage son  what a pleasant surprise  carrey can act when not behaving like an ass  very entertaining  thoughtful movie  certainly gives one second thoughts as to just how much television intrudes into all our lives  shades of 1984  not too far away folks  if were not carefulsterling ed harris as alwaysi was disappointed however not to see the reunion between truman  sylvia but then the humantruereal aspect would have clouded the entire concept perhaps  good movie  highly recommendeddissenting intellects please keep in mind the adage paraphrased an intellectual is one who has been educated too much,black_comedy
the film is an amazing combination of existentialism surrealism and symbolism truman turns into a christ figure by the end and represents the desire of all people to find the truth of who they are and why they exist  what is really amazing is that all of this is poured together into one film that is entertaining as well as thought provoking how often do we get that from hollywood other than contact i cant think of many other films recently,black_comedy
rarely have i seen a major motion picture that looked as awful as this one does we get the fact that modern suburbia is supposed to look like a plastic paradise out of a tv commercial but the colors here are tepid the camera setups dull and unimaginative and the direction mechanical and without a hint of inspiration jim carrey playing truman whose life is a tv show though he doesnt know it shows off his dreaded range as a performer hes always oncamera a second too soon and stays there seconds too long this is also the fault of the director peter weir and the editor who hope we in the audience dont miss any of their tricks how could we when the whole setup of this story is as plastic as the towns inhabitants or when every gesture is as subtle as a pack of stampeding elephants 12 from ,black_comedy
i really hate jim carrey and my friends assured me i would like this film how wrong could they be i thought this movie was terrible i cant see how anyone can like such an evil concept because that is what it is a person lives their entire life for the satisfaction and enjoyment of a population of sickminded couch potatoes to keep someone in a place and intrude on their life is not in my mind good viewing but evil ed harris character should have been arrested for kidnapping not given awards i thought carreys acting was just the same as the rest of his stuff just toned down slightly the ending was totally implausible and unbelievable i do not have one nice thing to say about this film all trumans coworkers obviously were too greedy to see what they were doing was wrong i know it is just a film but with the way television is going this type of thing is potentially just round the corner and it will be a big mistake the day that someone actually does this this film is totally unbelievable a big waste of money and it was a complete waste of my time,black_comedy
truman is a truly boring overrated pompous movie that is not worth your time people rate this high because they think we are supposed to if we dont then we are not getting its point and we are lacking  jim carrey does do a good job however ed harris character is ridiculous hes just not believable the main reason this movie fails is the storyline is ridiculous its just to far fetched society isnt so cruel that we would allow let alone watch a show like truman celebrity boxing and survivor sure but the premise for is cruel the main character is not a voluntary participant basically hes innocent and being violated and we are supposed to think everyone thinks its ok wants to be taken seriously and thats not possible with this weak farfetched story the idea was good but this movie stinks even with the talented actors starring in it,black_comedy
god i wanted to like this film jim carrey is a good actor an excellent physical comic hes also capable of giving heartfelt truthful performances he does it hereconfound it i want to like everything peter weir does i frequently dont but im always willing to give him the benefit of the doubt anyone who can do a picnic at hanging rock cant be all bad he obviously has the capacity to make us see feel understand without overstating the obvious all while skirting the obvious for heavens sake therefore should have been one of my years high points cinematic ally maybe i was in a bad mood when i saw the advanced screening i returned and actually paid to see it maybe the firstview dyspepsia carried over maybe i hadnt given it enough timei rented itokay i liked it less the second time i saw it i almost hated it on the third viewing i know i knowa film  play painting a joke whatever  is meant to be grabbed on first view by single exposure repeated looks are bound to let us explore flawsbut dammit i was trying to give the thing a break really it is the kind of thing i should love whats wrong with truman its one of those things that says its going to do something it tells us what it intends to show then proceeds not to show us but to restate the thesis and the audience is expected to buy into the notion that the film has actually explored the issues whatever they aretruman for me is all statement and no delivery it gives us a wonderfully correct themea charming easy to rootfor heroa potentially exciting and interestingly equivocal villainthen blows it all away because it hasnt got the courage of its own setupwhat would make truman despite a lifetime of conditioning get on that boat nothing he so easily accepts the unacceptable he so easily overcomes every problem the film gives him that there is no dramatic tension no questions no okay no film of course it presents us with a userfriendly feelgood ending the sitcom man takes charge of his life victory vindication and we dont even have a clue what trumans life  or life in general  is about nor alas does hesorry too facilelike jim carreys talking buttan easy laugh a gofortheguaranteedresult this film for me is a smug simplistic selfcongratulatory exercise in hollywood telling us whats wrong with hollywood  and usgo write your own screenplay on this theme bet you can do it better,black_comedy
i cannot believe all the hype surrounding this movie  after i saw it i sat there dumbfounded thinking this is what everyone thinks is so great  it was a good idea but so slow and boring with such an anticlimactic ending that i almost fell asleep  and of course jim carrey took every opportunity to make stupid faces even in a dramatic role it was totally unbelievable and took forever to get to the end i thought it was incredibly silly and would not recommend it to anyone,black_comedy
this movie just might have made a good half hour episode on the twilight zone but there just isnt enough here for a feature film and the idea is hardly original  the sixties series the prisoner had many similarities do yourself a favor and skip it,black_comedy
to tell you the truth i think i missed something how else can people say this is a good movie sure i think that the concept is a cool idea and this is one of harris best roles but other than that there is no reason to see this movie again and all that oscar buzz for jim carreyhow jim carrey was better in ace ventura than this movie,black_comedy
have you ever stopped and actually looked at your everyday life where its going where its coming from the people you share it with the events that have shaped your life right up until this point in time thats the dilemma truman burbank is facingtruman jim carrey lives in the idyllic town of seahaven the sky is always blue the people are always friendly he has a loving wife and mother its as if everybody knows everybody life couldnt be better but something is missing from trumans life in a way he cant explainalthough trumans life is seemingly perfect he doesnt get much fulfilment out of it theres a desire burning in truman to explore to see the world to get out of seahaven but most importantly to find a woman called sylvia a woman he grew to love a woman who filled the void in his life a woman he has never forgottenif trumans life sounds perfect to you thats because its been engineered that way unknown to him his entire life is a tv series a series calledtruman is the star of his own personal reality show cameras follow his every move the town of seahaven is an elaborate set and the townspeople are actors including trumans wife and mother the events of his life are all under the watchful gaze of christof ed harris the shows creator and overall overseer he decides trumans destiny his every decision possibility and train of thought he controls trumans dreams and ambitions broadcasting his life to an audience of millionsis a truly extraordinary film one of the most daring thoughtprovoking and intriguing films to come out of hollywood in god knows how long the attention to detail in this film is just amazing but its the little things that keep bringing me back such as the ominous advertising posters dotted around designed to put truman off travellingthe film has been created in such an intricate way it constantly improves with repeated viewing the way we follow trumans exploits are incredible how the influence of the creators are always around like the way truman has been deliberately traumatised to keep him away from the ocean and thereby discovering the truthjim carrey is the emotional core of the film and he rises to the challenge admirably for the most part he reins himself in becoming increasingly disturbed as he slowly senses the truth little errors and discrepancies such as a stage light seemingly falling out of the sky stage hands caught putting together sound stages and the conversations of the creators filtering through his car radio start to alert truman to the truththe small details of trumans artificial world really enhance the viewing experience i like the adverts on tv subliminally suggesting he should stay home instead of thinking of travelling as well as the creators trying to make good when theyve slipped up in their routine the subtle attempts at brainwashing are everywhere and send the chilling message of how much power the media has over our livesed harris also puts in an excellent performance as the megalomaniacal christof a man with a messiah complex hes been watching every aspect of trumans life from the day he was born and will continue to script his existence till the day he dies which may be a day of christofs own choosing another chilling possibility the possible what ifs and maybes are intriguing because there is so much potential to this type of situationone of the most touching aspects to trumans life is the connection he formed with sylvia she was a sympathetic costar and tried to reveal the truth to him but a relationship with her went against christofs master plan and you can see the way hes scripted encounters that would lead truman to marrying another woman merylso christof had sylvia kicked off the show but she touched trumans heart and he spent so many years searching for her unsuccessfully of course one of the best scenes is during a talk show with christof about the making of the show we learn so much about trumans artificial world and how much power christof has over his life the idea of a corporation buying a child from birth is not only sickening but also a chilling foreshadowing of what the media will do for ratings sylvia has every right to be appalled by this and the arguments between her and christof are both compelling and intriguingas things come to a head and truman begins to rebel against his existence in seahaven i found myself rooted to the spot there are seldom films these days that can have that effect on me truman on the sea trying to escape christof using every means at his disposal to stop him the people glued to their tv screens i was practically cheering truman onill never forget that part at the end when truman finally gets out the look on christofs face is priceless he looks a broken man for the first time in his life hes lost his power over trumanbut the ending is truly exhilarating and is the emotional icing on the cake the only complaint i have with peter weirs film is i wish it were a little longer i would have liked to have seen more of the relationship between truman and his onscreen wife and how they cope with their sexual relationship and their jobsbut is still a magnificent film a wonderful insightful journey of one mans dreams being observed by the everyday world as christof puts itwe accept the reality of the world were presentednext time you look in a mirror make sure you really look you may not be the only one staring back,black_comedy
there is something very emotionally affecting when you watch someone slowly start to realize that they are caged how truman was totally controlled by a corporation what they insisted to call real yet controlled it was controlled in that this young boys truman father was taken away from him he was deprived the joys of growing up with a father not because it was his fathers time to go but because a board of advisers thought it would be good drama and would help to keep him where he was in their prison it doesnt matter that seahaven island might in fact be the greatest place on earth and that the real world is this sick place truman should still be afforded the luxury of choice that we all have and when you consider that he didnt even get to choose the girl that he married it makes you feel that much more for him and i think there is some truth to the statement that we accept the reality of the world with which we are presented at least christof wasnt so blind that he actually realized he could leave anytime if this was more than just a vague ambition if he really truly wanted to leave theres no way we could stop him he was right the line that i believe defines this movie we accept the reality of the world with which we are presented my personal favorite i like your pin hows it going to end i was wondering that myself,black_comedy
truman jim carrey is an insurance salesman with a pretty ordinary and fairly routine life he lives on an beautiful island with good friends and a lovely wife but he longs for more he longs to leave his life and seek pastures new the trouble is he cant cross the water after his father drowned when he was just a boytruman grows increasingly paranoid that the world is watching him and he couldnt be closer to the truth his entire life from birth has been witnessed by the world because his life is a reality tv show that has millions of avid viewers in the beginning there was just one camera but as he has grown so has the scale of the farce in which he livesjim carreys performance is outstanding he avoids his usual madcap style and relies on a much more solid and touching side to his ability with a fine script good support and wonderful direction is a compelling original and moving exploration of human trials and emotionsreality tv with a difference and its great810,black_comedy
with all the reality shows currently on tv it feels almost like the concept presented in would be the next logical stepis about the insurance salesman truman whose life is a tvshow the biggest reality show in history he is filmed around the clock and has been for all of his life the only thing is he doesnt know it but now things are happening that makes him question his reality how will this affect him is a very entertaining film besides the interesting concept presented it is also well written well acted and masterfully directed what also makes it entertaining is the way that you feel sympathetic towards the characters the way that many of them are believable in their artificial way jim carrey does some of his best work here as truman far removed from the antics of the pet detectivein the end what raises this movie above the crowd is the interesting concept a concept that should give plenty of food for thought for people with tendencies towards paranoia it also asks important questions about the importance of freedom vs security questions that are more important today than ever beforei rate this 710,black_comedy
is a dark drama that is well done by director peter weir writer andrew niccol and star jim carrey as the dramatic lead  i truly believe carrey should have gooten the oscar  his performance as truman burbank the simple yet always wathced for many years on television by millions of viewers person should have got him the oscar for best actor he doesnt portray the usual goofy comic guy but this time a simple man who is in the media crossfire and he doesnt even know it  its like putting a guy who thinks everything is normal in a wrestling ring full of actors who improvise  well done dramatic composition that looks at how sick we have become  inspired by twighlight zoneness a,black_comedy
yet again this film illustrates that the hollywood machine should on no account attempt films which speak to you at some deeper level stick to making thrillers scifi romance mainstream comedy etc which they excel at but leave subjects like this to the european cinema or at least to the east coast tradition failing that only a director of the stature of david lynch has the breadth of imagination to tackle a story line such as thisquite simply the problem is that the film cannot make up its mind whether its a moral fable or by a huge stretch of the imagination a representation of some form of reality as a result it continuously flips between these two genres and cannot quite make up its mind which path to take or which one to stick toas a representation of reality quite apart from the corn like the director wearing a beret gimme a break the wife trying to do product advertisement in the middle of a flaming row  its just too full of illogicalities and inconsistencies to bear even a remote resemblance to any real life situation one might just about accept that were the whole populace of the set also in the same boat as truman himself the scenario might  just might  work but a solitary figure in a landscape of actors and extras anyone with any experience of working in entertainment media sector could tell you thats simply not feasible and the fable angle doesnt work either because direction and production strive too hard to show film pertains to a real life situationbut the most glaring hole in the whole storyline is why go to such lengths and expense to examine human reaction in a supposedly reallife situation just stick enough cctvs in any small township or village pay the inhabitants some dosh and tell them to get on with their life as has been proved time and again subjects fairly soon tend to forget that theyre the subjects of a study and begin to ignore the cameras,black_comedy
i feel gutted after fast forwarding this heap of embarrassment i have rarely seen a movie so devoid of entertainment value intelligence or plot a guy in a virtual world finds out hes not in the real world sails off to find the edge of the studio finds it has a sappy talk with god the end in between highly annoying people smiling smiles as seen in 1950s commercials and a script from airplane iii which never made it to the big screen for perfectly healthy reasonswhy wasnt there any subplot some deeper meaning someoh i dont know anything if they tried to have any it surely was smashed during the employment of the 3 megaton thermal nuclear device that was used on the silver lining the entire story was so laughably straighforward even primates would find it insulting im truly sorry but this movies glaring emptiness and its pitiful acclaim completely beggars belief and really challenges my mental sanity when thinking about it010,black_comedy
is a remarkable movie truman jim carrey is a character on a tv show whose entire life has been watched by millions worldwide from birth through adolescence up to the present truman is not aware that his world is an artificial one created specifically for the purposes of its director producer christof ed harris it is a story of trumans awakening and a story about life the movie can be taken on several levels as entertainment it works as a story which itself has levelschristof as creator of trumans world  is godlike attempting to create a paradise for his sontruman is a type of ourselves the existential human condition he is in a situation inside the box in his world unaware initially of the outside world of anything beyondbecause truman is a being with consciousness he gets clues that things are not what they seem events occur that indicate the way he originally perceived his life is different from the way it really is examples include  the studio light falling from the sky  the character he falls in love with  the strange way his wife does commercials  the reappearance of his father  the technical error when the car radio switches to set directions truman at one point remarks it feels like the whole world revolves around me somehow the girl he meets so briefly and falls in love with is a type of those who are enlightened who know that life is more than what we see think understand she seeks to reach him but he does not understand her words because of his frame of mind he is trapped inside his mindset ultimately we are each like truman we are unaware and as a consequence passive about seeking freedom from our situation through chance events we become awakened and begin to notice the periodic clues that tell us that life is more than it appears to bethe result of this awakened consciousness is a decision to actfrom my 1985 journal notes to understand the world we live in we must first see it as it is not as we are trained or manipulated to see it where do our ideas come from ideas about god about right and wrong about how we should live are they chosen orit is interesting that while the world truman inhabits is counterfeit the emotions he feels are real so with ourselves we do not really perceive things as they really are but the emotions we feel  our fears hopes anxieties  these are very real in another sense we are also like the other players in trumans world like the extras and bit part actors we tend to get caught up in playing our roles but not really concerned about the real situations of the persons around us our lives can become all script all show in real life we can be so busy with our roles that we do not consider others needs trumans awakening leads to a single overwhelming desire to obtain his freedom from this world that is his life perhaps on another level we are like christof manipulating all the sets all the characters for a higher purpose personal glory christof sought ratings he was a mastermind but in achieving this end he degraded trumans humanity all people in the show were his to manipulate it was his right he believed and he was possibly even sincere in his love for truman who was a son to himat times we ourselves think we have a right to control everything we each want to be christof in our own sphere of influence it is unsettling when one of the characters is unpredictable doesnt follow the script does not cooperate with the show ultimately this can lead to a crisis and the relationships can change christof offered truman a safe crimefree world but truman wanted something more valuable his freedomwhen truman began his quest he was not even aware of what it was he was escaping from but he knew he must escape ultimately he was seeking to escape from the bubble the dome his artificial world like truman we too must strive to escape in order to find our true selves and to see what life is all about like truman we have become immersed in a world of illusions but the quest cannot be successful without taking risks trumans quest became an obsession in order to escape he had to face his greatest fears real fears and it nearly cost him his life but he found the door a door he didnt even know existed and upon walking through to the other side he would find a new understanding as he left behind everything that was known and familiar to embrace the unknown little did he know that she was going to be there waiting for him so too with us there are clues if we would but observe them that life is more than just the material physical molecular world the scriptures are a book of clues the grand design of nature presents us with manifold clues conscience is a clue and deep within our hearts the still small voice in case i dont see you good afternoon good evening and good night,black_comedy
is a film in which jim carey plays the character truman burbank who is an insurance salesman that seems to want more out of life he finds later that there is something strange about his surroundings that isnt authentic there must be someone watching him because everything seems to be orchestratedhe goes on from this to the discovery this hypothesis is true and that there has to be more to the world than he has seen he tries to escape his surroundings that he was groomed to be accustomed to and finds that magically every attempt that he makes is unsuccessful because something always comes up as a blockthis aspect of the movie portrays much of what one must imagine would happen in the raising of a wild animal in a controlled environment they would either find that there is no way out of their environment and eventually give up or they would rebel this would be much like in jurassic park where the dinosaurs find a way out of the fence of the controlled environment truman is a wild animal that is kept in a controlled environment that is against his innate will and instinct his instinct is to explore and find meaning to life he is a wild man on the lose and nothing can stop his aspiration to venture to the unknown this is much the same in jurassic park in that the animals that once ruled the earth have an instinct of free range they will by their instinct find ways to become top of the chain againthere are many that will find that the movie has some underlying spiritual meaning and that the producers had some great theological statement to make about how we view god and whatever else may come to mind many may even say that it is a statement of theodicy in that god has everything perfectly orchestrated to his will but makes mistakes in his outtakes others may say that much like what the mormon church believes god was just a man that was given high power of which he abused and screwed up thus bringing disorder to his creationwhile all of these are legitimate statements about this movie none are quite on par as much as to say that this was a movie for the sake of entertainment and poking fun at reality television while reading many interviews of weir one will find that it was a satire on reality television and that it was to show how fake it was it is almost as if it were to show the persons involved in reality television are pets that are subject to what the master throws at them all of their responses are controlled and generated responses from a learned behavior in one way or other these directors have simply learned how to manipulate those responses to get good ratingsunfortunately unlike jurassic park is not worth a sequel the movie was poorly made and had a juvenile story line the plot development was not adequate for the audience to fully connect with all of the characters it was obvious that the prime focus was to give jim carey a character portfolio that would bring his career into a deeper more meaningful position while this being true more than likely this was the only way that a writer of a movie in this caliber could get his work published one can find an actor with the need to diversify come up with a budget and create a film with a big name and it instantaneously happens they have a careerfor any person to say that this movie had any type of effect on them spiritually would be to say that the care bears shaped their epistemology ultimately leading them to jesus there is about as much spiritual meaning to this movie as there is in a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and to say otherwise is to deny that of the words of the director and to read cosmetology into gandhi,black_comedy
where can the movie go a man discovers at the age of 30 that his life has been entirely a manipulated television show and the world around him a stage set and the people around him actors the scenario necessarily requires quite a lot of suspension of disbelief and is meant to convey a message director christof does not merely want to keep his show alive truman was an unwanted baby and christof deliberately wants to keep truman in his cocoon world to prevent him seeing the world outside and how bad it is and does everything he could to discourage truman from wanting to leavebasically the story is predictable once truman knows the world around him is manipulated why would he bother to stay if he can leave the cocoon why wouldnt he if he is a normal healthy man really with everything spoiled the whole point of the show is lost and there is no way things could have ended otherwise so the storys end is actually anticlimactic,black_comedy
this is one of the best movies i have seen in my entire life the truman character interpreted by jim carrey is awesomely played this movie even if it is not the cleverest movie evercan make you laugh and cry with the main characters problem the plot is very intelligent and its a kind of movie that has never seen before and its charm will last while the years pass this isnt a new movie it is pretty old actually but every time i watch it it makes me feel the same as i felt in 1998 when it came to our cinemas this movie is an automatic classic of movies and another great movie of jim carrey i recommend it to every one who likes jim carrey and good films,black_comedy
im embarrassed to admit that i missed this film first time aroundfinding it in the cheap bin at the local supermarket i decided to give it a trywow for those who believe that jim carrey is a slapstick actor with only the ability to play goofy low brow comedic parts then watch this film his performance is extraordinary its difficult to keep the lump from your throat in the last moments of the filmed harris always a great performer gives a perfect role as the arrogant controller of the tv show that is trumans carreys life other supporting roles are equally well actedbut it is carrey who gives a stunning performance this is no mere walk through of a man out of his depth it is nothing short of an oscar wining performance and that it was completely overlooked just goes to show what a mockery the oscars can bethe film is thought provoking and humorous tension building and provocative in fact everything a great film should be what would i change about this film nothing it is a standalone modern classic,black_comedy
truman burbank jim carey is the most famous person in the world and he doesnt even know it he was raised being filmed around the clock and the star of a reality viewed all over the world the simulated reality television show  ironically called exists inside an enormous dome with simulated weather and its own ocean completed with over 5000 cameras following some strange occurrences truman starts to think that he is being watched little does he know that he is soon to find out that his whole life has been broadcasted globally truman burbank is a normal man with a normal wife a normal job he has a normal life at least that is what it seems truman fear of water stops him from ever leaving the perfect little town of seahaven or to see the woman he really loves lauren natascha mcelhone is trumans high school friendgirlfriend she knew about and tried to tell him about it she was taken away the creator of this simulated reality tv show christof ed harris controls all aspects of trumans life in seahaven like whom he meets what he does and everything in the dome christofs antics are a little bit unpredictable you dont know if his actions are trying to help or ruin trumanthe film is set in two time zones the outside world is set in modern times and in the dome is set to seem like it is from the 50s era this movie includes flashback of when truman is a child including when is father died causing his phobia of waterstarting of as a comedy it is soon realized that this movie has a deeper meaning one example is when truman looks like he is walking across water to a door that opens into a black space the director peter weir seems to be trying to show an example of nirvana he uses different angles and mise en scne so it feels like you are watching and not a movie peter wier has used the art of cinematography well in this moviethe audience that watched are a group of people who wanted to be entertained no matter what the consequence to truman it reminds us of soaps paparazzi and how we like to know about celebrities and overall how the product could be the death of someone like truman burbank,black_comedy
its been about a decade since this film came out and the sad truth is the majority of people havent learned reality tv is not dead but has rather flourished and is gradually becoming more and more perverseindeed making the idea presented here seem almost tame by comparison which is a very unpleasant notion to consider digging deeper into the lowest common denominator to grab attentionworse still its working and they are at least as shallow as theyve always been quite possibly worsei wont claim that i watch them and costing depth in real people by abandoning it in favor of more ratingsgrabbing entertainment niccol is not a man who favors superficiality or that which seems at first glance to be perfect beautiful or even right nor is he one who keeps quiet about his view on said subject one needs to look no further than two other movies he wrote gattaca and s1m0ne both of which he also directedhe is perhaps less shrill in his protesting in the former and this compared to s1m0ne ive not watched much of weirs work to this day only this and dead poets society which my review will immediately reveal i did not find to be anything special therefore i dont know whose idea it actually was to let the imaginary hidden cameras be our eye into the world of truman whether niccol had it in the script or weir thought it fitting but i commend and respect whomever thought of it the score and music are fitting the acting is good allround carrey surprises harris is marvelous carrey may have some sillier moments in this but it is a film separate from his comedy work those seeking his typical brand of humorwhich it should be noted i am somewhat fond of wont find that satisfied herein exposition is delivered with fairly good subtlety the writing in general is excellent niccol hits the mark entirely and maintains a realistic tone steering carefully clear of the pitfall of mockery to the point of the ludicrous which he would later fall into with s1m0ne and his continued exploration of reality is interesting i personally make it a point to keep up with what the man is working on the satire and cleverness found in his work deserves recognition this as the cable guy has some social commentary on the viewers but on the whole this is by far the superior filmsorry ben it is but saddening that it would seem that the film caused exactly what it may have been trying to prevent i recommend this to fans of science fiction andrew niccol and jim carrey as a dramatic actor 810,black_comedy
i love movies good and bad new and old with the countless and awful remakes in todays world its hard to find a movie thats original and unique today i rarely watch new films since i think the older ones are better imoi wouldnt consider myself a huge jim carrey fan i like some of his movies but not all of them i had the honor of watching this great film several years ago in a college psychology class and loved it the basic idea of the film is that a man who believe what he is experiencing the real world is in fact a staged tv show that has been going on for years and has no idea about itthe film itself is unique because to my knowledge nothing like this has been done before until edtv but that was different the movie itself brings up an interesting point is everything that we do in life just part of some gran scheme and somebody is watching out lives this film also has a quote that i would like to point out we accept the reality of the world with which we are presented this quote itself imo sums up the entire film we dont question the reality that exists as we see it we accept it but how do we know its real how do we know its not some persons dream and that once they wake up we die we dont know that nobody knows we just accept it and deal with it truman doesnt question at first the world he is in little by little he questions the system and overall learns about his wolrd that he lives inif you have not seen this film then i would strong suggest you watch it especially those who have psychology background,black_comedy
i had heard a little bit of i was watching a program where they were discussing jim carreys career and they mentioned how was like his first major drama and how well he had performed in it i never realized that this film was so well liked especially when i went onto imdb and people seemed to love this film very much so of course i rented it at hollywood video and watched it last night and i have to say that i have pretty much the same opinion as most of the users its a great film that had a great dramatic story with a little dark comedytruman burbank seems to have the most perfect life he has a beautiful wife a close nit community a desk job and a loving mother but is it a little too perfect especially since everyone always seems to know his name he meets a girl lauren and they hit it off but she tells him that she cannot speak to him or theyll take her away from him she tells him that his life is a tv show and that his whole life has been a set up he slowly discovers what his life has been and how its either too perfect or the dramatics come at the perfect time but is the world ready to let go of is a well acted film with an incredible story that im more than certain any one could enjoy it was very charming and had the perfect elements to the plot jim carrey did a terrific job and this movie proved how great he could be in a drama instead of all comedy laura linney was just perfect i loved her constant details of everything she bought and how she presented it like a commercial i think you will enjoy this film its a good one to watch810,black_comedy
the site wont accept my correction to a goof so im placing it on record here perhaps someone who has access will correct itspoiler the incorrect goof says factual errors near the end when truman is on the boat christof uses some extreme weather conditions to try and stop truman leaving however he is on a sail boat in an environment were the weather can be controlled all christof had to do was stop the wind or change its direction to go back to port a sail boat goes were the wind goes changing the winds direction would not have helped sailboats can sail to upwind destinations by tacking see any standard reference on sailing for confirmation such as the wikipedia article at en wikipedia org wiki sailingsailingupwind spaces inserted in case urls are forbidden hereif christoff had stopped the wind truman could have used the motor on the boat which we see him trying to start at one pointas for the movie genius jim carreys best and a much weightier accolade probably peter weirs best,black_comedy
back in 1998 the concept of jim carrey appearing in a more serious movie than his usual fare was unthinkable surely the man who gurned his way through ace ventura couldnt handle a thoughtful wellwritten drama without the shadow of those tropical shirts ridiculous catchphrases and ludicrous facial expressions looming all over it well while the studio may not have thought so either consider the marketing campaign which focused mainly on the comedy the results speak for themselves and established the man as more than just a onedimensional funny mancarrey is truman burbank a man with a seemingly great life who just cant shake the feeling something is wrong his world seems so neat and organised too perfect to possibly be real and when a camera mysteriously falls from the sky for no immediate reason it kicks off a chain of events that lead to him questioning the authenticity of his very existence for unbeknown to him he is the star attraction of a program all about his life within a sealed idealistic eisenhower era world of apple pie and sunshine and everyone around him is an actor every second of his life has been watched by millionswith a concept such as this it is no surprise that the movie raises a lot of troubling issues the philosophical nature for instance is not unlike that of the matrix in that it is difficult to sit through it without wondering if there are limits to the very world around us furthermore the moral issue of reality tv rears its ugly head asking us what price we pay when we glamorise the ordinary and make everyday people our entertainment sure truman has had a good life and is totally safe from harm but how much of that life did he choose for himself carrey of course is a magnetic focal point he was clearly keen to stretch his very capable acting muscles by this stage in his career but that isnt to say his comic side has been totally abandoned just watch his attempted road trip to new orleans for example the man barking and ranting maniacally as he careens almost out of control through town in his car with his hysterical wife on the passenger seat trying to reel him in it is a very funny moment in the film but his actions here are brought about not by the inherent zaniness in his personality but more by the growing frustration at his inability to get out of the townhowever the scene where he really comes into his own comes in the moments following his encounter with his supposedly dead father driving to work one morning his radio malfunctions and after beating the thing with his fists like weve all done at some point he suddenly picks up radio transmissions detailing his every move he parks his car and wanders the street trying to draw attention to himself but failing even stopping a bus in the middle of the road to no reaction the occupants simply waiting for him to get out the way what if he really were the exact centre of the universe and everything else just revolved around him that isnt to say this is a one man show however laura linney as his wife meryl is also well cast her wholesome nature at first being very sweet then growing ever more troubling as carreys paranoia escalates then of course theres ed harris as the eye in the sky directing his every move at first he is a benign guiding influence crafting a utopian vision for his progeny but then the child begins to resist the father and events spiral out of control soon harris has become a fascist dictator denying truman the choices he so desperately needs to make himselfas a whole then is a rewarding experience it contains one of carreys finest dramatic turns to date and while we can revel in the philosophical and moral issues at work here it can also be enjoyed simply as a very charming and uplifting movie come the climax i doubt therell be a dry eye in the house,black_comedy
some imdb reviewers of has suggested that this is a satire of reality showsi disagree it is much more a satire directed to hollywood pretentiousness and egosmore importantly it is mainly concerned with how we are programmed to accept societal perspectives and ideas without questionthese are forced upon us and they form a wall around our reality  breaking through that wall is what is all about,black_comedy
this movie was ambitious and attempts to be a classic yet a weak screenplay prevened it from being soit turned out to be a deluxe episode from the twilight zone insteadcarrey did a very good job showcasing more of his versatility adding to peoples respect for his talentsyou will get your time and moneys worth from this movie thoughit is worth a look if you are looking for one of those light comedydrama movies that still makes you thinka must for carrey fans who are growing in number fasthe is one of the best comedians all time and this movie confirms ithe proves he is not all slapstick and rubber face only but is capable of other styles of comedic techniques,black_comedy
is one of the most original captivating and entertaining comedydramas ive ever seen this movie is very different from any other movie ive ever seen eventhough in plot its not extremely deep it has an excellent premise which is more than a twilight zone ripoff   one of the things that sets this movie apart from other alternate reality moviesedtv pleasantvilleis the exquisite acting led by the pitchperfect performance from jim carrey this movie has a great mix of excellent character actors but like i said it is all fueled by jim carreys brilliant golden globe winning performance as truman burbank a man whose life is on television 247 it is still beyond how he didnt even get nominated for an oscar when his performance was by far the best of that year the other oscar worthy performance comes from the great ed harristhe abyss the rock unlike carrey harris did get nominated for an academy awardhe lost to james coburn   when you put all that together along with the brilliant direction of peter weir and you not only the best movie of 1998 but also one of the best movies of the 90s see this movie 1010,black_comedy
some general comments about the grave injustice of this film being robbed by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences would obviously be unnecessary due to the high amounts of people demanding an explanation for the inexplicable lack of a best picture oscar nomination for this film so let me just go about in praising this film was definitely the best movie of 1998 and one of the five best of the decade behind pulp fiction goodfellas schindlers list and forrest gump  what struck me about the film is just how meticulous everything was  andrew niccol and peter weir really thought everything out to its fullest dimension  it took me two viewings to appreciate this films greatness but the scene that will always strike me is just how carefully orchestrated trumans moonlight stroll by the beach with laurensylvia is used to elicit an emotional reaction  chopins piano concerto no 1 in e minor has never sounded so melancholy and beautiful as this wonderful scene and the breathtaking imagery and careful buildup to trumans makeshift assemblage of her face is one of the most impressive and subtle plot developments i have ever seen weir does not bang us over the head with this film unlike some films that were inexplicably crowned with the sheath of greatness namely the people vs larry flynt or saving private ryana wellmade film no doubt but not the greatest war film ever made  whoever claims that this film could have been more missed the point of subtlety that this film was trying to get acrosswhat did you want woody harrelson and juliette lewis suddenly appearing on the screen to deliver some oliver stonestyle message on violence or the jfk conspiracy  the films climax is one of the most surreal and strangely moving pieces of cinema i have ever seen and just the way carrey enunciates a pained was nothing real to ed harris was worth an oscar nomination alone  give me carreys nuanced performance over the contortions and muggings of benigni anyday a trait he must have inherited fromcarrey himself  oh well to give this film the recognition it deserves would be to misrepresent the academy of motion picture arts and sciences as a sincere incisive group of people instead of the smug and sanctimonious group of bootlickers they truly are,black_comedy
i finally watched after all of the talk i had heard about it and all of the articles i had read i really had high expectations for the film that was supposingly robbed of a best picture nomination i must say i felt let downanyone who thinks that jim carreys performance is oscarworthy is insanely out of their mind saying that is similar to asking why tom hanks didnt get an oscar nod for the burbs carrey gives a decent performance that to me differed in no way from any of the performances that he has done before there are still elements of his comic side scene in which he drives around in circles trying to foil the other cars present here and he really never comes through with any element of real drama it all seems fake however who knows hanks started his acting career by doing mainly comedies until philadelphia and look what happened to himthe film itself is directed well by peter weir who i felt had so much potential to use other interesting facets of the life of truman it seems that we are given a quick intro into the life of truman and are all too quickly rushed into his ploy to get out of the dome and fly to fiji if only the first half of the film was devoted to what life is like for truman and some of the neat ways everything that he does ends up on camera this film could have been much better we are hardly introduced to his family friend and coworkers before the film turns on itself and leaves a lot of interesting issues untouchedis a good film overall however not even close to the neargreatness achieved in two of the best picture nominees that i have seen so far saving private ryan shakespeare in love i guess ill have to look to edtv for more of what i was looking for710 stars,black_comedy
just as a warning before i begin this review does include spoilers i personally believe that there are a lot of satirical messages in but i think the most prominent is that the media is used to display peoples lives in whatever way they please targets the media and displays the problem of media manipulation this idea is exaggerated by truman being the medias subject matter without consent for every moment of his life we see this in real life with celebrities in paparazzi photos and reality tv shows although contrary to truman celebrities are aware that the world has their eyes on them throughout the movie we see the producers of the show plant subject matter into trumans life such as his father coming back to life or all the advertising for hot chocolate this can show how the media manipulates people in the movie the inhumaneness of trumans situation is deflated the movie is ironic because trumans audience knows that hes on television but truman does not i really enjoyed this movie especially after having realized the satirical messages hidden within it,black_comedy
this post contains a few spoilers aboutthe movie has a huge satirical theme the whole movie and show is about truman who is unaware that he is constantly being watched through secret cameras and that everyone in his life is actually just an actor and every event in his entire life has been stagedthis movie is still very relevant today and might even be more significant since technology has improved since 1998 its even more possible that there are small nearly invisible cameras watching us and there will always be the possibility that youre constantly being recorded even if its common knowledge that you are such as cameras in traffic lightsinflates the issue of cameras being just about everywhere by putting cameras everywhere in trumans town and it can be argued that trumans character represents deflation hes way too oblivious to his surroundings for way too long which seems like a deflation of basic human intelligencethis movie also uses connotation very well in the beginning strong powerful words arent really used that often but after the movie reaches its climax connotative words begin to appear a lot more frequentlythe audience of this movie is everyone in developed fairly technologically advanced countries and the target is likely the government or other institutions who may use cameras without permission or knowledge of the subjectsthe persona of the show is truman himself and is very effective as truman realizes that hes being watched and that everything in his life has been stagedis practically based around a hyperbole everything that occurs in the movie from the cameras themselves to truman not being allowed off the island are extremely overdramatizedthis movie also uses praise by blame and blame by praise to help get the satirical intent of the movie across it blames sylvia for trying to tell truman what is happening about a third of the way through the movie the directorwriter of is seen praising the show and the entire movie shows watchers of the show completely invested in watching trumandelivery notice for liberty public schools this correspondence and any attachments is sent by a student at liberty public schools any unauthorized use disclosure or distribution is prohibited and may be unlawful,black_comedy
was a fascinating movie that captures the idea of living life the way you want to live it and searching for the right thing until you have found it in this movie the main character truman burbank lives in a town called seahaven which is actually a television show the beginning of the movie definitely has a few innuendos to what is actually happening everyone in trumans town are actors and no aspect of his life is real but he doesnt know this throughout the movie the idea of having a perfect life is definitely inflated as a reason for why truman should stay in seahaven and why be kept unaware of what is actually going on in the world and what he is actually apart of the actors all try to keep him in the dark and anything that could give him a hint to what is actually going on is hidden this eventually leads to the paranoid side of as we view trumans world we watch as he begins to find one thing odd and then another until he is very paranoid and he wants to scrutinize everything in the town that seems odd this was interesting to watch because as an audience you already know what is going on you are waiting and hoping that truman will also figure out the truth and escape his fake world to finally live a real life instead of his artificial one,black_comedy
is a juvenalian satirical analysis on the effects of media and the manipulation media has on our lives and is extremely effective in targeting people who may not know how absorbed they are in modern day television and media while some may argue that is in fact a horatian satire piece the deflation used to downplay the actual inhumaneness of the show portrayed in the movie is only hiding the actual dark things going on such as using plot twists to make traumatic event actually happen in trumans life the entire thing is an ironic take on trumans life truman has no clue that viewers are watching his every move while the audience and the viewers of as both the show in the movie and the movie are named are in on the false narrative set by the directions of the show by inflating the viewership of and portraying everyone as constantly watching and being obsessed the movie furthers its satirical intent of showing how obsessed everyone is with media and how the media can manipulate our lives the subtle innuendos of truman getting subliminal messaging through the radio and television programs is also an innuendo to us as viewers and is an eye opener as to how much we to are subconsciously impacted by the constant stream of information going on all around us in the beginning of the movie truman is shown to be going about his daily life just like many of us and bumps into an object that seemingly fell from the sky he later hears a program on the radio about how a plane flew past earlier that day dropping parts as it went truman did not react at that time but the connotation to the viewers was that it was an explanation to truman that he didnt even consciously register but was subconsciously filing away the incident with the explanation,black_comedy
i dont know why people rate it so high its story was different but this is just 2 much,black_comedy
i found to be a very interesting through effective satire in trumans world everything is perfect from his perfect wife maryl to his desk job just a short drive away in short truman is living the american dream what he doesnt know is that his life is just an illusion carefully tailored by a television producer broadcasting his every move live 24 hours a day and that everyone in his life is an actor after a series of small mistakes and mishaps by the cast and crew of the show truman slowly begins to question his world peeling back layers of the giant set in this movie the producers of the show act as the media constantly stimulating our minds with directionless static that without careful attention can fall onto our radar as allconsuming truman in this show acts as the everyday person completely absorbed in our world of media news and mundane reporters the repetition of trumans daily life reflects our own in this day and age what really then is our objective in life if we continue to live the same loop for so many years we have goals yes but why are we still stuck in the cycle every day i loved this movie because the viewer acts as both the observer and part of the issue at the same time because we were so focused on the story we werent aware of our surroundings in real life which was brought into clearer focus when truman became justifiably paranoid the viewer here is both truman and the creators of the tv show this was an incredibly real movie especially in this day and age where we are so engulfed in media 247 and i would recommend it to everyone especially children who are more vulnerable to media influence,black_comedy
wow what an experience ive never seen a film more thoughtprovoking as this one  nothing compares to its originality and true craftsmanship put into the production an absolute gem of cinemathere is so much about this film that i love the overall idea of a mans life controlled and watched entirely by a tv corporation is intriguing as can be i especially love how the tv set resembles a 50s nuke town architecture wise and how the civilians all actors dress and speak its a perfect environment in which the protagonist truman burbank can gradually find small hints and clues as to what elaborate insidious plan is taking place over his lifemore to add is the stellar cinematography it has the shots are arranged as if we are seeing it through the hidden cameras put on the tv set and it can be in the most peculiar of places  lightposts trash cans posters magazines even trumans wedding ring this aspect adds another layer to the film that is unique from most other films standard camera framingthe musical score fits the film in the most absolutely perfect way  that is unparalleled to anything ive witnessed before yes i have since come to learn that the musical score was in fact not composed for this film but for a 1989 foreign film  but the notion still stands the way it is incorporated into the setting gives off an eerie mood as it fits the films eerie feelingsand finally i simply must acknowledge the absolute feat of the script and acting that is present in this movie  notably from jim carey i have to admit that jim carey isnt really a favorite actor of mine hes a decent comedian but from what ive seen of his i realize his best work is actually in his dramatic roles has careys best acting its literally perfect i honestly prefer him in more dramatic roles the supporting characters also put up a phenomenal job with their line delivery and overall acting also thanks to the intricate screenplaymy favorite of the entire movie is the ending when truman crashes his sailboat into the edge of his world the tv studio as he walks up the stairs to the blended in exit door the emotion is in full swing the elegant music stunny cinematography and heartwrenching dialogue between truman and the creator christof its then when christof tells truman the truth sayingtruman who are youchristof i am the creator  of a television show that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millionstruman then who am ichristof youre the starand at that moment to christofs dismay and as the tv transmission of ends truman walks into the real world leaving one where he really was the only true man,black_comedy
is a moving beautiful movie that never gets old almost everything about it is absorbing multilayered and ultimately inspiring in a way that few movies are director peter weir uses powerful imagery and riveting performances to tell a timeless story about humankinds unending quest for freedom with truman a true man at the center i love the films story which uses its ingenious premise to critique a global culture increasingly dominated by celebrity obsession and reality tv in a posttruth environment where the leader of the free world is a former reality tv star couldnt be more relevant the finale is easily one of the best ever in cinema history and ed harris performance is perhaps the finest of his career  the fact that he didnt win the oscar for best supporting actor astounds mei want to give a perfect 1010 but i cant due to the movies narrative problems the logic of the films world the explanation for how truman was adopted by the studio or why truman never discovered his whole life was a show until his 30s isnt laid out until the movies third act making the central premise hard to believe for most of the film a basic rule of screenwriting is youre supposed to establish the setting at the beginning not the end of course the movies premise is so good that i mostly ignore this problem while i watch it but im still left wondering why the state of california allowed a corporation to adopt a child or hold a man against his will  questions the movie never answers im usually willing to overlook plot holes if they dont hurt the overall viewing experience but even after watching multiple times i have a hard time finding the central premise believable i know its fiction but even star wars and lord of the rings operate within the suspension of disbeliefisnt flawless but so what movies dont have to be like people we enjoy them despite not being 100 perfect because of the way they make us feel and better appreciate the experience of being human inspires me every time i watch it and i cant wait to see it again 910,black_comedy
this is the reality of modern world too we often do what we may think its great based on our favorite movies and series personalities,black_comedy
an absolute classic was a movie that blew me away this film is genius on so many levelsthe film follows truman burbank a man living in the perfect world of seahaven who is unaware of the fact that his entire world is a large set and he is the star of a grand tv show known as created by christofif youve only heard the synopsis now and never watched the movie then you must be wondering how will this movie work i had the same thought before watching it after viewing it i can say that is exceptionally made and one of the greatest films ever to come outwhat makes this movie undeniably amazing is the direction screenplay and acting peter weirs direction is simply outstanding there isnt any moment where you feel bored since the film paces extremely well the cinematography and shot selection is perfect both add to the realism and make the idea of this world being a tv show very believablethe acting all around is fantastic jim carrey plays truman effortlessly aside from the script carrey makes the character of truman believable and lovable with great emotion and personality ed harris was also brillant as the manipulative creator of the show everyone elses performances felt real as they pretend to be in the same fictional world as trumanthe most praise i have to give this movie to is andrew niccol for giving us this unique and thought provoking script he has wrote a script that will get people to think because is much more than what it looks like on a surface level as you dig deeper into the many underlying themes of the movie thats when you realise how profound it really is the films plot is very interpretive many viewers will come up with different theories trying to piece together the actual meaning of the movie there are ideas relating to the way media manipulate people god reality shows desires and much moreis an example of how great cinema can become weir and niccol have done an exceptional job and i applaud their efforts this is a movie that gets people thinking and highlights many relevant ideas in an entertaining and accessible way for everyone to enjoy,black_comedy
jim carrey is an odd one isnt he much loved for his slapstick stylings ive never really warmed to that side of him is different yes theres carreys silly side but here it makes perfect sense in his fictional world with every detail dialled up to eleventystupid its the sinister underbelly thats that lights the touchpaper though its ridiculously troubling taking a baby putting him on camera cutting him off from the real world and fabricating a picket fence utopia without his consent or knowledge its the knowledge factor thats key for truman not his lack of but his thirst for this is ed harris world his character cristofs idea of utopia and as truman grows up he outgrows the godlike creators vision sure theres love too a longing for someone but truman is an explorer its in his soul and cant be contained or controlled its a film full of spirit as well as chuckles and twilight zone drama but its the rooting for the underdog urge that makes me love this so much maybe we see ourself here somehow dont we all sometimes imagine ourselves as the star in our own show and what is real in our consumer world anyway we accept the reality of the world with which were presented but we all know whats real and whats fake well just about this is a fun film a simple premise yet feeling utterly original and as over the top and grand as the world it displays its cinematic to the core even boasting a philip glass score and is probably my favourite carrey film although eternal sunshine is great a joyous ride to the end with genuine heart in mouth moments was nothing real well who knows,black_comedy
i really enjoyed this jim carey is obviously famous for comedy but he shines here the story was clever and the movie was nicely played out you really feel sorry for truman,black_comedy
everytime i watch this movie i cant help but thinking george orwells book 1984 the big brother is always watching and you cant escape is your life really your own do you make your own decisions are you really free and if not can you run away you may try but its almost certain that itll kill you and if not theyll call you crazy the similarities with the book  in a way  are almost scaryjim carreys performace is breathtaking you just cant stop feeling sorry for truman and you cant help but cheer when he makes it,black_comedy
had the chance to watch this movie only now but i was completely stunned by how good this movie was when ill think back on the classics of this decade the 90s like the shawshank redemption pulp fiction saving private ryan the green mile ill be adding this movie toothe premise was very simple and yet the way the movie develops itself is fantastic you basically know from the getgo who truman is and whats the show itself is what surprises you moves you inspires you on so many levels ill mention some of them 1 first theres the manipulation theme which by the way mentioning it in my time the year i write this review is so relevant and is amazing how a movie 21 years old at this time was able to predict something so big that is sort of happening right now 2 then theres the freedom theme which in this instance basically says dont be what others or what this world may want you to be be yourself find your own unique path 3 this one is one that basically tormented hollywood for decades to come and is the life is a lie thing or life is irrelevant or life is meaningless in the way that everything is just on a loop everything that happens is not real that you are living only a scenario or a dream see inceptioni could go on and on about the whole messages this movie transmits but you get the point aside from that the performances are all fantastic especially from ed harris and jim carrey who gives one of his best ever performances the only thing distracting from that are his momentarily ace ventura moments but aside from that is maybe on par with his performance from eternal sunshine of the spottless mind the score is fantastic and well suited for this type of movie everything else is just flawless and if i were to pick a thing that bothered me or a thing i didnt like i would have to really search and nit pick ita masterpiece in every way possible that surprised me inspired me moved me and entertained me a lot 1010,black_comedy
is a film i never got around to watching until now despite having heard references to it here and there over the past  twenty years now that i have seen it i am somewhat glad that i waited because from this vista twenty years later it really seems prophetic think about all of the children who were born after the ascendance of the internet many of their lives are not unlike trumans life every moment captured for all the world for all of timewhat is even more disconcerting is that many people willingly choose to focus on and cultivate their internet presence at the expense of everything else we have become a selfie culture and reality tv thrives because people not only like to watch other people but also to put themselves and their lives on display modern people have become narcissistic exhibitionistsand are proud of it,black_comedy
was made in 1998 by peter weir and stared jim carrey as truman burbank the movie is about a man whose life was created and managed by a director to broadcast every aspect of his life as a massive tv set actually he had lived his entire existence in an extremely huge tv studio and had been surrounded by actors playing the parts of his family friends and neighbors before he realized the truth and decided to live the spurious town called seahaveni would consider the movie as an intelligent and insightful one in which the actors presented outstanding and believable performances the idea and plot seem to be completely original which are developed perfectly and can astonish everyone the movie contains a great deal of symbols and metaphors which make the audience to reconsider and question every single scene and dialogue falling a light from the sky which was a part of the show equipment is a good example as it gives us the insight into the collapse of trumans world also the sea is the main symbol for both freedom and confinement it represents confinement as it is so vast and truman is too scared of water due to the fake death of his father in the sea which was planned by the director to frighten truman to make him stay in the town on the other hand it represents freedom as it is the only way to leave the counterfeit town and enter the real world trumans final decision to face his fear and sail on the sea can implant this idea in audiences mind that in order to fulfill a dream and win over obstacles we have to fight against our fears and limitationsalthough it sometimes seems that some movies are paying less attention to the concept of life and using the most unimportant ideas to form a story is a proof that there can be great and highgrade ideas that are able to be turned into masterpieces the movie shares both comedy and dramatic moments and the depth of idea and used metaphors have created one of those movies that we can think and talk about when it ends,black_comedy
i saw this in theatres when it came out but never wrote a review til now i always felt this movie was a little on the boring side but itll always be a classic just because of the concept i really think they should work on remaking this movie they could sure do a lot with it today,black_comedy
jim carrey at this point was known for doing comedies but then he decided to try something different when he agreed to star inthis movie is where carrey plays an insurance man truman burbank and his whole life has just been a tv show broadcasted 24 hours everyday he doesnt know it until he suspects very odd things going on and must find a way to escape itwas a pretty good movie its not entirely a comedy but you do tend to get some chuckles out of it it would classify it as a comedydramajim carrey gave a wonderful performance and manage to pull off some really good dramatic work this proves that he doesnt have to be funny in every single movie he is in he can just act normal and serious and it makes the movie worth itsimilar to the movie fight club this is one of those movies where the story is really good and easy to understand but there are moments that can confuse you to where you would have to watch it again and you can understand and enjoy it even more ive only seen this once and i think it had some moments that were strange and confusing but if i were to rewatch it again i can comprehend it better and enjoy this movie even morebottom line is a pretty good movie and is easily jim carreys best dramatic movie he has done,black_comedy
suddenly my partner talks to himself like talking to someone with cocoa in his hand how strange i feel that trueman the protagonist of this movie stands for everyone in the world who was born and has grown up under their parents or caregivers if it can be regarded as a story which people try to independent from their guardians the development is not so bad at the last scene of the movie truman said his line by his strong will by doing so he overcome his guardians,black_comedy
is one of those films that proposes an idea many of us had as children somewhere in time the cultural zeitgeist started implanting the idea what if we are in a false reality but we become aware of itthe grand scale of the operation is what keeps the viewer engaged this is one of jim carreys more precise acting roles he has a plethora of energy but manages to keep it reined in laura linney is average ed harris underperforms and noah emmerich almost steals the show at times noah has the best line in the filmoverall its a good movie that is worth watching mainly for the scale of the show and for jims performance the movie fails in addressing questions of morality,black_comedy
i was totally underestimating this movie and i did always postone watching it  this movie should give you another vision and perspective about our lives  totally worths watching,black_comedy
on a whim i decided to whip up whose premise is new in itself  a person is the unwitting star of a reality show starring himself as the protagonist the whole town in which he lives in is the worlds most expensive settheres so many great elements in this film  the music amazing the cast jim carrey deserved an oscar nomination for this his acting was absolutely beautiful the themes this film is as dystopian as 1984 if seen from the pov of jim carrey and of course the feelings of alienation and conformitywatching this film is an experience in the end you feel as if youre also part of audience this rollercoaster of emotions that the film takes you through is mindnumbingill not be ashamed to admit that this is one of the first times i have cried on seeing the ending watching this piece of art is an experience in itselftldr  1010 go watch it however you can,black_comedy
for me theres really a lot thing going on here for a comedy genre this movie for sure bring a lot of thing speaking about og man how can you make something that suppose to feel really easy as a comedy movie but yet so full the story it self was brilliant the detail how peoples around truman need to see convincing for him and an act for us it was a complex variabel for me the way audience react to this show can make you feel really itchy how can they still be watching after all of scene when truman start to noticed all of itits masterpieceand i cant find a word to describe that ending,black_comedy
have you ever thought to yourself at one point in your life is the whole world just a big stage show and where i go the world follows and sets scenes with actors playing a part is exactly that thought put onto filmjim carrey stars as truman who as a baby was selected to be the star of a reality tv show that follows his life and every move he makes with actors playing everything from his parents to his wife his best friend even the guy who sells him his morning coffee the world he lives in is a massive set which he thinks is the real world every aspect of his life is controlled and planned out like a tv show now 30 years old truman starts to question the world around him as people from around the world tune it to watch him 24 hours a day 7 days a week the world watches in awe of himi first saw this movie when it was released still a kid at the time i just found it hilarious because i mean its jim carrey but watching it now as an adult i release how good a movie it is in drama and comedythe comedy is classic jim carrey from his physical comedy to his many voices and crazy rants you will laugh so much the drama aspect of the movie shows how people care this man they have watched grow from his first steps to his wedding day he is the worlds most famous person and he doesnt even know it and we get a look at what the world would be like if it really did revolve around us in every way would we yearn to break free or be happy to have a quiet life free of all worries and stressesthe psychological implications of the movies premise is very interesting to see done on such a scale even in a movie and really gives us a unique look at a scary inner thought of what the world would be like if you were the most important person in itgive this movie a watch if your jim carrey fan a comedy fan or just enjoy a unique movie and a story that really does make you think about the world around you,black_comedy
truman show is such a classic the way the movie was made was so good the concept is quite impressive well the concept might be a little unrealistic because you know imagine that your whole life was all fake from the people the things thats happening your house your town all is fake and the only thing thats real is you the movie itself is just so spectacular the acting was so amazing jim carrey can like handle any role especially the scene where truman was sailing all by himself even though hes terrified of the water that scene was just so powerful and for me a little emotional as well the cinematography was very impressive the scene where trumans boat reached the wall of the studio then he was walking to the exit door that scene has really great cinematography was so impressive this movie was released almost 21 years ago and its still so good there is one thing that i learned from this movie no matter what happens just be the best version of yourself to end this review well in case i dont see ya good afternoon good evening and good night,black_comedy
have seen this movie very late even after being a big fan of jim carrey im glad ive seen it it is a must watch and a masterpiecethis movie makes us think that the world we are living is it all scripted are we just acting or being used as actors hahahasounds funny watch to know more,black_comedy
this is my favorite film ever made it had a huge impact on my life as im still in high school and want to escape from my current life and find my true place in this world this film connected with me because of that truman is slowly realizing that his life is a false one and tries to rebel against the people controlling it wanting to escape them and find his own pathbut i do feel that jim carrey acted a little too goofy in some places but other than that a great performance i loved the music too it was kind of experimental dreaming of fiji is actually how i heard of this film in the first place i heard it on a playlist on spotify called atmospheric scifi soundtracksa truly touching film and it will have you thinking about afterwards,black_comedy
i love how this movie is really great concept and how it stays simple and doesnt try to be anything too complicated the story is so easy to follow but you never get bored because its just such a crazy idea that you would have never thought of before watching it,black_comedy
shook me by its audacity of premise and execution this is straight out of the twilight zonein fact writer andrew nicchol based the screenplay on an episode of the twilight zone jim carrey plays an insurance salesman who has no idea that his entire life is scripted and part of a television show this is a departure of sorts for peter weir also and though i have forgotten much of this film i remember liking it a lot there are many underlying themes and the entire presentation is something you dont see often this is a healthy recommendation regardless of whether you are a fan of carrey or not,black_comedy
this is one heck of a good moviethe movie is seriously good for tv show loversi had a good time watching it worth watching,black_comedy
is jim carrey as you have never seen him before this is straight out of the twilight zonein fact writer andrew nicchol based the screenplay on an episode of the twilight zone jim carrey plays an insurance salesman who has no idea that his entire life is scripted and part of a television show this is a departure of sorts for peter weir also and though i have forgotten much of this film i remember liking it a lot there are many underlying themes and the entire presentation is something you dont see often this is a healthy recommendation regardless of whether you are a fan of carrey or not,black_comedy
i think that is very much a satire and a relevant one at that the purpose of the film is to criticize the entertainment industry and the lengths they will go to for ratings it is meant to target the makers and producers of reality tv trying to make them realize the error of their ways as well as the damage they can do with their platform there are countless examples of of reality tv shows that have gone horribly wrong as well as several times where individuals in the entertainment industry have snapped from the pressure that producers directors and even costars impose on them on a daily basis the audience however is for everyone because we as viewers can also contribute to the problem by supporting the show and making the producers feel like they have to exploit their actors for more views and better ratings it is interesting to see trumans growth as a character develope in such a unique way is funny ironic and wonderfully made but it also continues to convey a deeper meaning that even the members of todays society can connect with,black_comedy
i think that is a satirical film but it as not as obvious to see when watching i think that the main purpose of this film is to show how much control the media and hollywood has over the public and how they can manipulate us by what they show in the overall film it is ironic that they are sharing this message through a movie because hollywood is showing how controlling they are another example of irony is toward the end of the film when the director christof decided to drown truman to scare him but made that world for him so that he would be protected from the outside world this is significant in todays society as hollywood and major companies try to shield the public from the truth with products and issues in the world but overall it is hurting usi think that in the beginning of the movie they used deflation to understate the issue because truman was content with his life and didnt think much of it whereas the audience watching the film thought it was odd that his life was being controlled and watched one last element i think you can find in this film is blame by praise this because in the film the audience watches trumans life and most show approval of having his life broadcasted for their entertainment though the real intent through this is to criticize this type of action in our world i think there are several target from this film one being the people who are naive especially youths that dont understand that companies and politicians tell us lies another target could be toward those big companies and other hollywood directors to show them what they do to the public and how it is wrong,black_comedy
follows a man who was born into entertainment and his entire existence was for the purpose of entertaining the whole world his twenty fourseven broadcasting lead the viewer into his everyday life for his entire life i think the change this satire is trying to point out is the lengths people will go to to provide entertainment and make money i think this because the movie shows an over exaggeration of how we look at entertainment today you can see this in the deflation of the fact that they have trapped this man in a dome for his entire life and no one thinks this is inhumane the inflation of the perfect world and the safe environment that was created for truman was a complete exaggeration because the world though it isnt completely perfect is not a horrible place i think the creator is trying to comment on the lengths people will go to to entertain the public and to make money by entertaining the target would be people in the industry who exploit others to be successful and entertain the public the audience on the other hand is anyone that participates in watching television or really anything that is meant to entertain i think the writers use of blame by praise was perfect for the purpose of this satire because by praising this attitude the viewer can now see what is wrong with this ideal the connotation of the perfect life added to the overall theme of the satire because the movie was trying to create this world with no problems to make the viewer of the show think that keeping someone in a dome is okay without the use of these techniques the satire would have no been nearly as successful as it was,black_comedy
is an incredible portrayal of the crimes of media in our society through the life of truman burbank the film depicts the harms of the commercialization of everything in our lives sometimes even including our lives themselves by portraying a man who has been literally trapped within the media for the entirety of his life this film is able to satirically describe the metaphorical trapping of society through the media uses wellplaced humor to lighten its juvenalian elements of darkness throughout the film especially at the very end of the story in addition the cast does a phenomenal job of depicting the emotions of their various characters not only is this movie incredibly entertaining but it also confronts real issues that are more prominent now than ever with the exponential growth of influential media over the past decade our society has grown more and more focused on the media from social media to television shows the public has become deeply committed to centralizing everything around the media almost to the point that it has become their lives in regards to satirical elements there are many to be found in the target of this film is clearly the media and its powerful influence of nearly everything the audience is quite literally everyone with access to modern media which is quite a few people the most prominent satirical element in the movie is inflation inflates the issue of a media takeover by making truman burbanks life actually revolve around media this is a more exaggerated way of showing how the media has taken over our lives however perhaps the most powerful element used is deflation at the very end of the story after truman has escaped the television show of his life the many viewers celebrate for a few moments only to quickly go back to their regular lives searching for yet another thing to watch by showing how quickly the public turns its attention to something else depicts the dangerously short attention span of society with its main goal being to find entertainment overall spectacularly uses juvenalian satire to capture the attentions of viewers and show them real issues that can still be found in todays society encouraging them to fix it,black_comedy
this was a great movie there were some flaws in it though some of the moments in the movie just dont make much sense and first and it can be difficult to understand for some people the idea of the movie itself was interesting and the movie did a good job with doing what it was trying to do my only complaints would be what i said before and some aspects could be improved upon god movie itself ,black_comedy
one of my favorite film the concept its fantastic and the film is never boring even if you watch it 200 times in the same daya realistic rapresentation of the mass media ,black_comedy
my word no one in this world ever has the right to rate this less than 10 if the audience rates this less than that rhen i have lost faith in humanity if you happen to me a muser a ponderer a questioner then this movie shall haunt you like matrix also what a background score i care less about the technical details and that is how it is savoured dont judge everything go with the flow the emotions,black_comedy
is my favourite movie of all time the story the cinematography the acting the camera work everything in this movie perfectjim carrey gives his best ever performance as truman burbank a man whom lives his life the same dayto day for years until one day he starts to suspect that something in his world in very wrong he is the star of a reality tv show there is very interesting questions raised about humanity and in todays society its somehow became even more poignant in todays world of youtube vlogs and reality showsed harris gives a phenomenal performance as christof the creator of the show with a god complex he manipulates every aspect of trumans life letting him have no free will the way he talks and pronounces everything is superb for those who have seen you know the movies opening sequence is once again superbsome bits in this movie are hard to watch in which the ones that truman trusts with all of his heart say say something really meaningful to him and we see it is all a lie is heart breaking i would say more however i do not want to spoil but truman does truly try to break the fourth wall1010good afternoon good evening and good night,black_comedy
44what if your entire existence on this earth was one big lie what if you were a business and you didnt even know it seems to tackle the answers and your emotions definitely play a part in making the experience greata baby named truman burbank was adopted by a tv corporation and everyone who would ever enter his life was a mere actor when things go awry he has a sensation that the world revolves around him then he goes rogue as far as the tv producers and directors are concerned as he tries to find the truth at all costsjim carrey gives a very emotional preformance as truman his life is one to die for no controversy or chaos but he feels empty and unfulfilled there are many moments of truman is overjoyed but on the other side of the curtain are actors simply paid to manipulate his emotions on the other side of sea haven is a sick man controlling the stringsits an excellent movie about a person who has been robbed of their life and their dreams once he takes matters into his own hands he makes it all happen for himself accompanied by a great musical score stands as a winner and your pity will not be spared,black_comedy

the film really questions the perception of reality by whom is the real what is the truth at the same time it has been a very good criticism for the everincreasing human life especially the commodification of private life and human relations the film has taken up the growing television madness during the filming period and has drawn attention to a possible danger and when it says that it will be so in the future in the future the television madness is suddenly replaced by computer internet and social media madness while the film really makes people think about this kind of things it also feels the happiness that being free to live on their own again free and according to what is free and how it is discussed but the play of jim carrey who can directly convey these happiness and feelings to us even the seeing of jim carreys face in the wild animal detective jim carrey is causing people to grin or i said to myself that most movie stars are actually a bit of a truman movie,black_comedy

i have never been a fan of reality tv on television real emotions and real behaviour is not possible you can only be real to an extent because you know that the whole world is watching you in truman show  truman is unaware and hence he is real jim carrey gives a fantastic performance ed harris looks fantastic and acts very well the film is a thinking mans film it shows the human psyche of trying to go beyond boundaries it is beautifully made film,black_comedy
i think it is a really good movie because it is really inspirational and i think it is one of my favoutite movie,black_comedy
my review for this movie was 9 out 10 because there werent enough twist in this movie also why i picked 9 out of 10 was because truman did not know that is life was a show but the other cast did so thats not fair,black_comedy
maybe poses a reality to all of us sometimes we are stuck on an island that we cant get out of we are played on by people around us we become an exhibit that they can look at and be entertained as i watched i realized that life isnt very different from what truman had to deal with in the film the movie brings to us a kind of an indisputable truth through a narrative thats without a question impractical the experience seemed so real to meevery bit of paranoia and fear on jim carreys face seemed extremely familiar it was like encountering a truth that you have always been aware of but needs a rousing occasionally its not like a name that you know or a fact that you are aware of its something that you already know by virtue of feeling itlike breathingyou know you are in the rhythm at all times but you dont acknowledge it very rarely movies hit me pretty hard it could be just a scene or a piece of soundtrack so brilliantly coupled with a sequence that you no longer need words to make a connection or sometimes it is the sheer power of the screenplay hit me pretty hard not only because of carreys amazing talent to bring out emotions so impeccably onscreen but because the story seems so much in contradiction to reality yet so close to everything thats real for instance there is a scene where truman and marlon sit next to each other and have a chat as they watch the sunset truman knows something is wrong he knows he is being watched the scene comes across as very intimate in the beginning where both friends recount early childhood memories and marlon tries to convince truman that if everyone was in on it then hed have to be in on it too and that hed never lie to his dear childhood friend one that came closest to being a brother from trumans perspective there was probably nothing more beautiful at that moment a friend telling him what he meant to him and that everything will be okay it was a kind of a reassurancea feeling of warmth in the dire state of confusion that truman was in but to the audience there is nothing more sinister than marlon listening to christof the creator of the show on the other end picking cues and delivering his dialoguesjust doing his job this particular scene struck me as being a brilliant portrayal of how relationships work in real life everything that we think is truethe love and trust happens to be a just a perspective we are all truman digging the warmth of friendship and familiarity while not being really aware of the voice of a christof we think we lead a life of our own but we have so many people leading it for us towards the end as truman decides to step out through the exit door of his life christof tells him that there is no more truth in the real world out there than there already is in the world that was created for him i may come off as being rather cynical when i say this but at that moment it sounded right to me despite that jim carrey walking out with a final bow in the iconic end scene made me happy maybe sometimes the choice can be ours at one point christof says we accept the reality of the world with which we are provided in the end two security guards just switch the channel in search of a new exciting show i am not a nihilist but sometimes pieces of art such as these make me wonder,black_comedy
its shot in such a unique way that you can almost believe its the real backstory of jim carrey its an nice classic staple of film that many people should be able to appreciate for its originality and also for its meaty existential plot,black_comedy
this movie is also a masterpiece for me on the same level like forrest gumpmovies like this are not made anymore these days they simply touch youwell at least we can be happy with them we gotsome actors are really made for one specific role and this movie is made for jim carry incredible good movie,black_comedy
on the surface is about a man who has lived his life trapped inside of a bubble he tries the entire movie to pop the bubble and he eventually doesunder that layer though is a complex theme does truman really enjoy his cell he seemed to for years at the same time he struggled with memories but dont we all as the viewer were left to determine the morality of the happiness of millions versus the freedom of one were also left to consider whether trumans cage was better than his freedom a child born into a system that doesnt have a great track record or a life of relative safety with no knowledge of the cage the viewer also has to determine the sturdy nature of reality what is reality besides our perception of it whats real to jim or to bob are the things that are real to them real to me if ive never seen or heard about them beyond the philosophical questions the movie poses the film itself is solid jim carrey pulls off the part wonderfully hes more than just a comedian although he can bring the humor the instant the scene needs it the supporting cast fell right in line the pacing may be a little slow early on for many viewers but that is remedied once the action begins to pick up,black_comedy
an american satirical scifi fantasy this is fabulously thought provoking and prescient of a future celebrity culture jim carey is well cast and the film has expert direction from auteur peter weir the themes are 1 how far is one prepared to go to break out of ones world view and 2 what are the boundaries of broadcast sensibilities for an audience seeking the truth,black_comedy
this movies concept is bizarre but it is extremely welltold with minimal plot holes its funny its dramatic and its extremely entertaining its hard to describe but if you havent seen it then its time for you to watch it,black_comedy
i really liked the end and the plot but during the movie i thought it was a little bit cruel because it was very sad that truman was taken away by christof and it was very mean but the end changed it all,black_comedy
a compelling humorous and exhilarating film by peter weir describes the life of truman burbank truman lives what he thinks is a normal life but what he doesnt know is he is being watched by millions of people this is dramatic irony because we know that truman is on a tv show but he doesnt in his day to day life of being a businessman truman is being filmed by numerous strategically placed cameras 24 hours every day inflation is shown because reality television is extremely exaggerated truman believes he is living a normal life so people see his real life and not anything fake the target of is people that are involved in tv shows and appear fake for the sake of looking better than they are he was born on camera and raised on the worlds largest television set with cameras on him constantly and actors all around him which he is unaware of through his wanna be crush and a series of crazy events he begins to discover that his life may not be what he always thought it was innuendo is shown when the girl he is interested in tells him that he is on tv this makes him question his life and want to discover what she really means he goes on the adventure of his life where he is challenged by the masters and makers of the perfect world he belongs in by facing his fears and showing incredible perseverance truman finally reaches the edge of the world he has lived in forever here he is required to make the decision of his life should he leave everything he has ever known and jump into the real world or should he stay in the comfortable and safe world that he is told he always belonged in,black_comedy
a satirical movie about a man who is very confused about his life and what his purpose is has several beneficial and specific messages to take from it as truman the main character goes throughout his repetitive day he runs into situations that nag at him and get him thinking about what he wants to do and how he feels like he cant accomplish them christof the tv shows producer in the movie has convinced himself and those watching and working for him that he has done this all to benefit truman rather than holding him back from the world he could be apart of the love story in this very complicated because of a sort of forbidden love that truman is in his feelings for a woman cause him to have a mission to find her by planning to go to fiji where he believes she is his journey to find this woman brings him to discover many important things about his lifethis story brings to attention a couple of messages such as the fact that you need to be cautious of the things youre doing and be aware of those who you put your trust in another message is that sometimes its more beneficial for those who you have custody over if you let them go and do what they really want to do the character christof does not want truman to leave the amazing life hes built for him truman however is ready to create a life of his own i related this to the relationship many have with their parents and how eventually it really will be time to start a life of your own when people are ready you should let them go i really appreciated this message and loved the different actors that helped bring the plot to life does a great job at bringing humor into this problem and making it an enjoyable film for a variety of ages,black_comedy
is absolutely one of the most thoughtful wellwritten movies of the twentieth century the purpose of this satirical film is especially pertinent in modern times as television and reality shows have become a central part of pop culture from keeping up with the kardashians to duck dynasty we all seem to have that one television program that we just cant get enough of but are these reality television shows actually real is an impactful horatian satire as a result of the effective use of lighthearted humor and satirical tools such as a clear target and audience irony inflation and deflation while is a relatively cheerful movie that people of all ages can enjoy it provides a lense through which modern people can analyze reality television and how it impacts our livesto summarize is an effective satire that dissects reality television like all movies that are successful in the box office appeals to a vast audience as people living in the twentyfirst century we cant seem to get through the day without instagram stalking our favorite celebrity or tuning in to our favorite reality show i believe that is a mustsee movie because it propels deeper thinking about the workings of reality television and how it affects real people in conclusion is a brilliant film that conveys an important message about reality television through the use of humor satirical techniques and realworld connections,black_comedy
is an awesome satirical movie with a lot of humor and some seriousness i believe that this movie is awesome because it kind of gets you thinking about the world around you for me i think about this movie quite often because potential spoiler alert if you dont know what this movie is about what if the world around me is all staged and nothing is real a quote from the movie struck me relatively hard when the character of the shows creator christof said we accept the reality of the world which were presented this struck me because of how true it is we go through our daily lives every day and do the same things over and over again without questioning anything and i think it is good to question things every once in a while enough of the philosophical stuff the comedy in this movie is also great it isnt a comedy movie but the humor is sprinkled in at the right places to create some comic relief my favorite scene in the movie is when spoiler alert the very end when he denies christofs offer to stay on the show and he uses his classic line and in case i dont see you good afternoon good evening and good night overall this is a great movie and would give it a 910,black_comedy
in a time of reality television and social media we have become more entertained by real people rather than scripted stories the amount of people who prefer the kardashians to a scripted television program is growing by the day this movie is something that has become more relatable and closer to reality as time has gone by truman is the first child to be adopted by a corporation he lives in a safe bubble of a town called seahaven every day in seahaven is a day with predictable but comforting story lines that all have a clean and tidy ending truman lives an extremely cookie cutter life the only catch is that none of it is real every step he takes is televised live to the world and everyone knows but him his closest secrets that are only to be shared with his mother are broadcasted for an eager audience trumans family and friends are all casted and their words come from their earpieces every turn and twist has been perfectly manufactured to shape a planned storyline for his show the idea is that he would be televised from his birth to his death but what would happen if the wholesome and family friendly truman became unpredictable in be ready to experience the humor of trumans world and also the darker themes of satire about the entertainment industry this tackles the issues of exploitation in television and shows the irony of viewing people in staged and outrageous situations as relatable and somehow normal i couldnt help but feel that i a sucker for reality television could be part of the problem the horatian like absurdity of so many watching truman do monotonous tasks as sleeping and brushing his teeth made me reflect on what the message really was as i lived through trumans eyes i couldnt help but wonder is it real life if im the only one really living it,black_comedy
along with using satirical techniques very effectively throughout the film this movie deals with a subject that is still very relevant today though the methods through which most people now receive media have changed lots of people especially kids struggle with being pressured to change through media in the film truman experiences what the creator of the show thinks is a perfect life though once truman finds out about the tv show he wants to be as far away from his old life as he can get this film does a good job of exposing the illusion of perfection that people can create for themselves using media social media specifically as this was a problem more focused in the television and movie industry at the time of this film today social media has become the center of this issue people can essentially create a brand new life for themselves through social media and this film shows how carried away a person can get without even realizing the issue overall this film utilizes satirical techniques in a way that enhance the film and its meaning while dealing with an issue that is still relevant today,black_comedy
hollywood is many times known for making movie after movie in search of a profit in doing so some of the movies churned out often have overused and clich ideas is an example of what directors in the movie industry should strive for the idea this movie is something that is unique and unseen before using satire and thoughtprovoking visions makes for an entertaining and enjoyable film jim carrey unsurprisingly does amazingly in his role while some may not realize it it takes just as much talent to portray comedy as it does drama and even more to switch between carreys excellent acting helped to bring the film up another level he has good comedic timing and performs the script very well the script is another element of the movie which helps to add to its acclaimed status it is written very well and uses satire in subtle ways throughout the entire film the script helps to express the underlying themes of the immoral ways of the media as well as the obsession with those in the public eye while hollywood is often known for repetitive remakes and sequels to once popular movies is a definite exception those who see it will realize quickly it is evidently different from a typical jim carrey movie those of which usually involve obvious and slapstick style comedy instead uses dark humor and multiple differing satirical tools to reveal the underlying messages that are portrayed in various ways throughout the entirety of the film these sinister messages become even more alarming when the audience begins to realize their actual legal viability in todays world the pursuit of reality is an important theme in today reality shows are already becoming more and more popular and they are multiplying at every opportunity these television shows are meant to provide the viewers with a sense of realness to their shows and make the subject matter seem ever more prevalent and important to the audience it has been nineteen years since was released and the underlying messages are only becoming more and more important as time goes on and the media becomes ever larger is wonderful film with many thoughtprovoking layers with philosophy comedy and wellwritten satire overall i genuinely enjoyed it and i would recommend that anyone who has the chance to should watch this film,black_comedy
truman burbank played by jim carrey has lived in the small town of seahaven his entire life he has a supportive mother a loving wife a fun best friend and a tragic backstory his life is practically a television show complete with product placement tooenthusiastic actors and the fact that no matter how hard he tries truman cant leave his hometown eventually he begins to realize exactly whats going on christof a producer comes up with the genius idea to create a reality show centering around trumans staged perfectly dramafilled life everybody in seahaven is an actor except for truman it takes him years to figure out what exactly is going on but once he discovers the truth about his life he begins trying to escape his utopia this satirical film shines a light on the objectification that media stars are exposed to every single day trumans television show is broadcast 24 hours a day 7 days a week every day since he was born this is a direct hit at how celebrities are constantly being observed and analyzed by the general public there is a clear audience being targeted by the making of this film and it is ironically enough everybody watching the film the movie is meant to show audiences just how detrimental their objectification of television and movie stars really is to the people in front of the camera the film gets this message across extraordinarily well many thanks to jim carrey who has audiences both in the film and real life rooting for him to leave the world his producers created for him and start making his own,black_comedy
was an exciting and all together enjoyable experience that makes people question whether or not they are being watched by others or by a higher authority for those who have never seen it is about a man named truman how has been on television broadcast his entire life without his knowledge to add to the fact all his friends and loved ones are actors hired and payed to be his friend and family they are all scripted to like or dislike him this movie uses irony exceptional well in the format of blame by praise it is praising the use of surveillance technology to monitor people without their knowledge just like big brother not the reality tv show but the government surveillance but it is real condemning surveillance of people against their knowledge that is one of the reasons i liked this movie so much it had many different levels the base level of funny humor and how that situation could never happen but then it gets into levels where it makes you think about whether or not with the increasing technology it could real happen or if someone is already doing it there are other meanings that are explored like that of free will and whether or not people want to make there own choices or to have them made for them or is ignorance bliss and the more knowledge you gain the more you become suspicious of the world and others is a great commentary on the nature of surveillance and what are humans really like without putting up a front,black_comedy
is a very clear picture of what a satirical film represents this satirical film represents how crazy a reality television show can be or set out to be was made quite a bit ago but it is still very relevant to today truman burbank jim carrey lives in a community that is completely domed over there is no leaving this community for truman truman lives a life where everyone knows and revolves around him truman is not only a known person inside the domed community but also around the world he is a star on a television show and he is the only one who has no idea about there are over 3000 cameras around town and everywhere that he goes every single individual in the dome are actors or actresses even his family and close friends is targeting what a lot of americans are obsessed with reality television these include keeping up with the kardashians jersey shore dance moms the bachelor the bachelorette and many more what we think we would be able to have from a reality show since it is real life and daily lives we will never be able to have it seems to be that these so called reality shows are now beginning to be staged and no where near the real life they actually live behind the cameras is a real reality show truman has no idea he is no camera and lives life normally doing his normal daily activities this movie is very enjoyable with the dramatic plot and humor put into it although this movie is enjoyable it does require more thought about how the society works and how it is portrayed in the film,black_comedy
there are many innuendos that can show that they are in a tv show but trumans the only one that doesnt know it like at the beginning where the wife has a small commercial for a new mower it is a great example of a satire because it shows that people can be very blind to things happening around them if they dont want to believe something when lauren tells him that its just a big show he doesnt quite understand and tries to make sense of it by just thinking she mustve been crazy there is deflation when people are talking about how keeping truman locked up in a giant studio his whole life isnt that bad because he doesnt even know it there is also a lot of irony in which everyone is watching him but he doesnt even see any of the people he truly knows the target of this satirical movie is people who will believe anything that a person says just because they have only known one thing their entire lives the target can be someone who doesnt listen to anything else because they only know one thing and try to block everything else out because they dont want to know the truth it is still significant to people today because it talks about how people can be so blind to people around them because they refuse to look for something deeper or the actual truth as to who they are,black_comedy
the story of a man who was never free sartres man was not in vain to freedom in freedom  television has been a sector player since its invention since the day it has walked on the arm with a cannon and has often been on the back of the movie theater cinema on the other hand uses a lot of the blessings of television a as a matter of fact the cinema has occasionally attempted to take revenge on television we can say that some of these initiatives give immortal artifacts to cinema history it is certainly not exaggerated to say that one of the master pieces of peter weir is one of the most important pieces of these works truman show tells a person who has met his fake identity in an isolated environment as if he tells sommerset mills that he never knew his name in the movie se7en and he says they follow us all they look at what books we have taken from the library and analyze us truman show is a production with only a few movies in fact,black_comedy
directed by paul weir starring jim carrey ed harris and laura linney is a satirical comedydrama about an insurance salesman who discovers his whole life is a television show released in 1998 the main character truman burbank played by jim carrey is perfectly summed up in the films tag line on the air unaware jim carrey obviously steals the show with it being centred on him with a genuine serious role instead of his usual crude wacky comedy self like in ace ventura pet detective truman is an insurance salesman living a lie unbeknownst to truman he is the star of the biggest television program in the world everybody he knows are actors he lives in a town inside a studio with cameras everywhere the character of truman is easy to like as he is honest and easy to sympathize with as he is a good man jim carrey suits truman in the sense that he is versatile in parts truman can act a bit manic and in others he is quite serious and emotional this plays into jim carreys hands because he is as ive said surprisingly versatile ed harris has a very good performance as a supporting actor playing christof the creator of the television program truman has been trapped in the best part of harris portrayal of christof is that you are not sure if he wants to help truman and believes he is helping truman or if he is doing this for himself for his ego money and overall fame in my opinion the films deeper meaning is that we have to question news and we cant be trapped in this fabricated world that reality television and the idolization of celebrities like the kardashians that the media has made in short theres a whole other world outside of your television laptop or phone screen that is why i feel this film is extremely relevant today because of people being constantly on their phones in conclusion is an extremely thought provoking film jim carreys performance anchors the film and the deeper message of the film is relevant in todays society overall i give it an 8 out of 10,black_comedy
hate it it so bad i feel like i am going to cry and kill myselfjokes it was ok i like the themes and the characters but i wish there was more blood it was amazing clotheswhen truman die it was so sad  my class like it my family like it f it,black_comedy
whats it like to live in the fake world well we all know that even though our world is not constantly recording and capturing our everyday lives depends on who we are its still dramatically similar to the world truman lives in we are surrounded by actors by people who constantly lie to us pretend to be our friends our loved ones and this is perfectly shown at the end of the moviethis movie is unique its neither too dramatic or too comic theres a perfect balance between genres and jim carrey does an incredible job totally worth of oscar nomination other actors are also great world is believable and ending is rewarding,black_comedy
is an american comedydrama film directed by peter weir in 1998 starring jim carrey as truman burbank a man whose life is transmitted 247 with a worldwide tv viewers audience the camera techniques the unique scenario and the themes it touches upon makes this film to stand out from all the other films of its kind and make it one of my favorite films of the 20th centurybriefly truman has lived his life without knowing that he is starring in a reality show he is observed by millions of watchers all day and night allowing christof the creator of the show to manipulate him and create the conditions of life that he lives in he is the creator of his fake life seahaven the town in which he lives is fake the people who pretend to be the citizens of the city are just actors and generally he lives in a fake life in order for truman to remain in his inertia of what is happening many people try to stop him from wondering and averting him from wanting to explore more however at the end when truman is 30 years old he realizes in what lie he has been living on and he tries to escape from this townsome interesting things about this film are its camera techniques and its setting to begin with the point of view is primarily from truman however manys the time that we watch the film from the perspective of the viewers of the show and the producers this enables us to understand how these people think and feel when they watch the movie while on the other hand when we see it again through the eyes of truman we realize how he perceives the world while he is unaware that he is the protagonist of a reality show some of the camera techniques the director peter weir uses are the following1he places the cameras in strange positions with many closeups and by shouting through circular frames in order to show that the constant surveillance of truman there are cameras everywhere2in some scenes the camera is at a medium eye level shot which enables characters to look at the camera sometimes although generally eye contact in films is avoided here it is used so as we can understand that everyone except truman are aware of the existence of the camerasmoreover the lighting must be examined because it is controlled by the creator of the show he decides when to change the time of the day and when to day night and the night day he gives us the sense of him being the god and thats what his name impels us too christof christofs name derives from christ and it is one more evidence that he is the god of truman in order to emphasize the fact that he is the creator of trumans life christof has low lighting on account of his deceitful character furthermore the film embodies many important themes such as the theme of advertising and the effect that media have on us consumerism is evident throughout the film either in a subtle or in a direct way through the product placement as an attempt to lure the consumers due to the fact that the show is broadcasting 247 they had to advertise products during the show and everyone is aware of the advertising except truman for example one advertisement was for vegetable peelers through the use of advertisements the director of the movie is able to criticize this tendency that companies have to advertise their products in the moviesthe effect that the media have upon us is one of the main themes in the film the viewers of the show become so obsessed and addicted to it that they seem to forget what the real word is ending up idealizing real world situations shaping their own individual meaning towards it the audience thinks that the world in which truman lives is the ideal and they are shocked by his choice to leave from seaheaven this dependency on the show and the control that the media have is illustrated through meryl meryl is a main character and she says that there is no difference between private and public life my life is is a lifestyle a noble lifestyle she and all the viewers forget the moral values and they do not think is wrong to keep truman on the show however sylvia who appeared only a few times on the show says hes not a performer hes a prisoner youre a liar and a manipulator and what youve done to truman is sick despite the medias and peoples denial he continues to fight for the human rights and the end for the reality showone quote from the movie that was thoughtprovoking is when christof the creator of the show says we accept the reality with which we are presented the way i interpret this quote is that directors and generally all the people who create a film present us what they want with their interpretations consequently when we watch a film we have to bear in mind that everything is in the imagination of the creators of the film we have to be aware of the devices used in order for an image for example not to influence usoverall i really enjoyed watching the acting is very good from all the actors especially the one who plays truman because he managed to capture his feelings and act as an ordinary person unaware of his role in a reality furthermore the directing was clever with the camera techniques the themes the movie touched upon are contemporary and they appeal to a wide audience making the movie more interesting it is a movie that i highly recommend and i would definitely watch it again,black_comedy
this may contain some spoiler the scene where the creator of the show tries to persuade truman for not leaving it was well written truman making a photograph of his lost love sylvia out of mag zines was also quite good personality of truman could have been explored in a better way they way he starts doubting everything happening around and deducing was not rightly justifiedmany faults can be ignored if this movie was made as a light humor with fantasythe whole idea of incorporating different characters in truman life is quite creative in same ways like usage of his friend marlon to insure him that everything in his life is fine and naturalthat was also a well written scene all in all a great movie to watch thanks for making it,black_comedy
in the last scene of shows two security guards who watch the show their whole day at work one of them says to the other what else is on after truman leaves the set for the first time in the history of the show truman says something directly to the fans watching is aimed at all audiences because it is a funny and dramatic film but only some will see the true meaning behind it for the romantics there is a love story between truman and sylvia lauren for the comedians jim carrey hilariously portrays truman burbank and for the dramatics it tells the all too sad story of how a young child is taken at birth and raised by a corporation for profit is a must see for everyone weirs take on was made to display the directors beliefs of what could happen if reality tv goes too far a fictional idea that could be all to true when someone is filmed nonstop for their whole life they ultimately are given no privacy weir named the director of on tv within the movie christoph because of a performance artist named christoph who would use people and other object to create art in some ways was made to show how artists might go too far in creating what they believe is art christoph traps truman in what is basically a cage for his entire life everything truman has been taught has been controlled by someone else truman has no choice in choosing what he can and cannot do his entire life has been controlled by the outside world weir is trying to warn people that if actions are not taken soon people may go too far in the real world restrictions on what people can do without an individuals consent should only ever be needed as a fall back artists and creatives alike although they may want to finish their dream project should have the ability to restrict themselves from doing unethical things peter weir has set a limit of what something should never be with his film,black_comedy
as told through interviews and footage through the film truman burbank is the unsuspecting star of a reality television program which is broadcast live around the clock and across the globe his entire life has taken place within a giant arcological dome in hollywood fashioned to create the seaside town of seahaven florida and equipped with thousands of cameras to monitor all aspects of trumans life all of seahavens residents are actors creator and executive producer christof wants to capture trumans real emotion and human behaviorthe producers have discouraged truman from wanting to travel beyond seahaven by instilling him with aquaphobia through the death of his tv father in a boating accident and by constantly broadcasting and printing messages of the dangers of travelling despite christofs control truman manages to act in unexpected ways during his college years truman was set to fall in love and marry costudent meryl but fell in love with another actress sylvia sylvia managed to bring truman out of the sight of cameras long enough to warn him that his reality is fake before she was taken away and offset with her father claiming they are traveling to fiji while truman went on to marry meryl he continues to fantasize about sylvia using scraps from magazines to recreate her face in secret and seeks travel to fiji outside of the show sylvia has become part of a free truman campaign that demands the end of the show,black_comedy
confronts us with a question more than one of us has probably at one point thought about before what if everything i take for granted is indeed just fake what if the world i live in isnt real and im just entertainment for someone else while it does so it raises some critical points its sad to say but im quite sure that there would be plenty of people willing to produce such a show if they had the chance to do so furthermore i can also imagine that plenty of parents would be selling their children for glory and cashwhile i really liked the female lead in this movie i slowly begin to worry that i wont become a fan of jim carey in this life anymore not that he played bad its just always a bit over the top the smile a bit too bright and the behavior a bit too enthusiastic to really take the otherwise very earnest plot serious i did cheer for him to escape not at least to reunite with his true love but the end may be a bit uncreative in an otherwise perfect illusion the best they can do is the most obvious staircase ive seen in a while and a painted wall but never mind what is so special about this film is that it is not too far away from what could happen especially nowadays with the technology increasingly modernizing it would probably be not too hard to make a baby grow up in a perfect illusion and that is indeed a serious thing,black_comedy
this is a film that is uncomfortable and difficult to digest because it weaves hard social criticism life in that seaside city represents the reality that we want to show to others as if we live by appearances we actually live it is an ideal city perfect calm without trash without crime without poverty where all are good friends but there is no relation of closeness or friendship or anger or rancor no trace of humanity in the good or the bad sense of the term and truman burbank is the symbol of an artificial human being in an artificial world it is this artificiality latent in everything that bothers always bothered the character who after all is unaware of being part of a millionaire reality show which transmitted to the world every moment of his life and here lies another important provocation essential to understanding the film a critique of the kind of tv shows we watch programs that exploit and make millions at the expense of peoples weaknesses and pains the film also makes some surreptitious and highly philosophical considerations equating the nature of god the size of the universe the reason for mans existence the film develops well around trumans quest for truth behind the apparent lie where he livesjim carrey is the big name of this movie he does an excellent job and proves to us that he can also be serious and dramatic however he may have disappointed some audiences who went to see this movie expecting another comedy he shone in this dramatic role is almost always present and succeeds even in the serious context of the film to look nice and play without getting to the point of idiocy ed harris also shone in the role of the director of the television program always trying to keep his star its a side supporting role but harris knew how to ennoble your character with a job well donethis is a complex and provocative film but it hides behind a relatively simple story and great humility it is not an elaborate production it does not seem to me to have been expensive nor does it have huge special or visual effects everything is done with discretion but efficiency however it is not a movie for anyone its funny without being funny because its not the humor that makes the movie work it leaves a lot open leaves many questions and reflections in our head for some it will be a boring movie,black_comedy
an engaging one of a kind fantasy yarn which propels you into a journey into an impossible world and is one of those concept movies that stays in the mind the only other comparable work i can think of at the moment would be groundhog day in the light of reality shows like big brother is effective in its depiction of an entire world obsessed with one specific television program which is in itself the ultimate reality show as it shows the 24hour day 7day a week life of the one guy whos not acting in a sea of fake appearances and pretend people blessed with excellent music and a fine distinctly unhollywood director in peter weir this is a film in which the concept cant fail the script is witty and highly amusing at times especially when reallife invades the fantasy world and has to be desperately explained away by the producersjim carrey  to be frank an actor i cant stand  puts in a restrained and adequate performance as truman probably the most accessible role for his nonfans ed harris steals his scenes as the frightening bullish christof and the rest of the cast enjoy playing their overthetop polite and friendly characters for all their worth with a knowing wink at consumerism and without too much sentimentalising this is perfect family fare and a mustsee little film with a warm heart and the feelgood factor in all probability it really did deserve the oscar nominations it received,black_comedy
this movie just proves what an amazing actor jim carrey was and still is the main role is played extraordinary well making viewer live the moment and feel as one of the real fans the soundtrack may seem odd at first but after a while you get used to the classical music and realize that in only makes this movie even more awesome if you really think about it the move has a very deep and hidden message which is relevant even to people in 2016 there is so much that everyone can learn from this masterpiece about the influence of television internet and press overall an amazing film made almost 20 years ago however still relevant to todays society one of the most original movies ever made highly recommend,black_comedy
for quite a while i refused to watch this based on who the star was i was familiar with his style and didnt care for it i finally gave in to all the assurances that this film wasnt like his other performances and i really liked itthe reviewers who say its like an episode of the twilight zone arent far off but i like the fact that its not taken too seriously unlike many tz episodes this subject matter as evidenced by many of the hated it reviews could easily have been presented and intended to be taken in a deadlyserious way but its not and i like thatthere could easily have been a showdown scene at the end between a disappointed unbalanced angry truman and his creator christoph i usually dont like openended conclusions but in this case i thought it worked truman remains the nice trusting guy he always was he sees his newfound freedom as a gift a longawaited chance to see what the actual world has to offer and he takes it with no visible hard feelings why not thats his character and his nature a confrontation scene would have been interesting and most likely wellplayed by both carrey and harris but it wasnt necessary the payoff for the audience is that christoph loses everything in the blink of an eye fame power income and the biggie complete control while truman goes off to begin his real life and presumably track down his lost love somewhere along the wayits especially interesting to view this today with the realitytv wave cresting the real people on these current shows are called cast members their lives are called storylines which are played out in seasons and sometimes it can be hard to remember that theyre actual human beingsstarted by christophs own admission with an unwanted pregnancy so did teen mom,black_comedy
when i first saw the ratings for this movie i didnt think much of it at first it just looked good and i wanted to check it out never did i expect this movie to be this good at all i was amazed at the detail put into this and i was always impressed at jim carrey about how well he did in this film it brought into light something that i have not seen him do that much at all not to mention the overall story of what is happening to him is so interesting to see that you cannot take your eyes off the screen for a second at all or you will miss something that is very important and very crucial to the film overall this movie was incredible,black_comedy
directed by peter weir comedydrama art film gained manifold nominations including 71st academy awards 56th golden globe awards and etc as well as a chance to merit a rank of top box office film and therefore to be a testament to a universal acclaim what has engendered such a successbeing set in the seaside florida in the 1998 the story revolves around the truman burbank who has been unsuspectingly living under the thousands of hidden cameras and been constantly broadcasted worldwidely since his birth for the sake of things go smoothly until he gets to know the counterfeit image of his life and endeavors to escape pending the disaster to the shows wellfarestaring the typecast comedian jim carrie as a protagonist in a dramatic movie could be considered as a bold decision yet so as not to result in a sciencefiction thriller as a manifestation of a simulated reality as it is seen in the special service episode of the twilight zone by which the script writer of andrew niccol was inspired eventually it turned out to be wellfounded carries charisma and his dramatic performance lend themselves particularly well in the comedydrama film that now may seem to us more funny than dramatic additionally the acting of the rest of the cast has contributed in the overall positive impression of the films that fully involves the viewer fires his imagination and gives food for thought even though the futuristic theme of the life in a simulated reality might seem rather unconvincing the director managed to realize this idea and make us believe that its quite feasible throughout the entire filmto sum it up in my humble opinion is truly worthwhile watching although having come out at the end of the last millennium it signifies the timelessness by its futuristic plot it may also act as a starting point for a viewers desire to get an insight in humanistic and post humanistic theories that this film implicitly enacts give it or take it,black_comedy
is an authentic work of art  a movie that arouses the chronic solipsism hidden inside you the backhanded yet comedic film certainly succeeds to both make us laugh and make us suspicious of life that is exactly whats so ingenious about it truman burbank whose life is the focus of a tv reality show displays brilliance of humanity and shows us how strongly our actions are styled by morbid curiosity jim carreys phenomenal and spontaneous acting fed the film and helped it elevate higher to the charts but of course carrey wasnt the only thing that kept the engine roaring for this film  it was the everbrilliant concept itself this movie is for the ones who have spent their life thinking and will continue doing so definitely a topclass movie jewel of 1998good morning and in case i dont see ya good afternoon good evening and good night,black_comedy
a wonderful tale about how the controlling manipulative world can be brought to its knees by a curious mind that will not be deterred noah emmerich almost steals the thunder from jim carrey but not without some of carreys trademark facial expressions ed harris is brilliant as cristof the brain behind the show in the movie i am disappointed in myself for waiting so long to buy the bare bones dvd just because the movie is so powerfuljim carrey is simply superb many doubted he could pull off such a role but he showed otherwise and without doubt is the true star of the show excellent scripting and editing and seamless direction from weir its arguable whether it will stand the test of time but is certainly a modern day classicgood morning good afternoon and in case i dont see you good night,black_comedy
is a very good movie in my opinion it shows good satirical elements while being very interesting to watch the show constantly keeps you guessing and wondering whats going to happen next the fact that it follows trumans life without him knowing but then cuts to the other side of the camera where the tv show is being created makes it really interesting perhaps my favorite part is when truman starts being unpredictable and the tv show producers have to scramble to fix it and make sure that truman doesnt notice anything once truman does start noticing stuff you almost feel excitednervous for him because the movie really makes you feel like youre in there with him and figuring out the mystery for yourself you definitely find yourself rooting for him to find his way out and it made me very much dislike the people behind the tv show who were trying to keep him in the show and oblivious to the entire world another aspect of the movie that i think the creators did well is adding in scenes now and then that showed other people outside of the dome in which truman lives reacting to the show and experiences that truman is having towards the end when truman is faced with a decision on whether to leave the perfect world as said by the creator or leave and go into the real world really puts the audience on edge because you really dont know what he will do all in all is a very well made movie that keeps you entertained and on edge the entire time,black_comedy
is an intriguing cinematic experience that delves deep into the ethics of human rights and free thought in a semicomedic way the film follows the story of a man named truman burbank an insurance sales representative who has a normal life we soon learn however that truman is the most famous man in the world without even his knowledge truman lives on the sunny island of seahaven a man made island rigged with cameras that are broadcasting live 247 to a tv audience every person in trumans life is an actor paid to record him and to create good television this movie seems to be a satiric commentary on several things specifically the control and influence that the media has on our society throughout the movie there are various product placements and references to things the consumers of the show will see it was also a satire over the treatment of zoo animals and prisoners as well as the control the government puts on our lives truman is completely controlled and although he is treated fairly he lacks free choice he only has the illusion of free choice which many believe to be a godgiven right to men was a well executed film i would highly recommend this movie,black_comedy
was a wonderful movie at first youre happy with truman and his life being a tv show star but soon after you realize trumans whole life is a lie and you become overwhelmed with the hope that truman will soon see past his false life and realize what is really out there beyond this fake tv show life you also realize how bad it is that they are allowed to adopt truman when hes born and make his life a tv show this will most likely infuriate you as you realize what there doing here is completely wrong and shouldnt have ever happened then you have to consider what i believe to be is a satirical piece in this movie i believe the satire part show how the government is in control of all of us and we are all truman only by questioning what is right and what is wrong will we actually find the truth the director is like the government they want us to to stay in what they think is a nice place to shelter us from the real world even if we want to escape they will try to keep us in here for what they claim is our good but really all they want is for us to stay here so that they can profit of us and live the cushy lives that they want to live,black_comedy
is a wonderful work of satirical art that takes the viewer on a thought provoking journey the whole way through truman burbank jim carrey is the ideal man living in an ideal world he has a wonderful desk job a perfect home in a perfect neighborhood but it is almost too ideal and truman soon starts to figure this out truman is also the star of the longest running television show to date 10000 plus days on live television to be exact his perfect world is full of actors and he lives inside a large dome but he doesnt know it yetprovides a wonderful movie with fine details of satire criticizing us for believing too much of what we hear in the media and to avoid it because it is taking over our lives even though the movie was made in 1998 i believe it is even more relevant than it was back then because now we have cell phones that keep us constantly connected there are so many more controversial stories today and because of that you cant always believe what you hearis overall a good movie that provides a good instructional satire i would recommend this to anyone who wants something to watch something that they intend to learn from,black_comedy
is a perfect example of how an unusual topic can still make for a successful movie most popular blockbuster type movies use generic plots about a bad guy who is stopped by a good guy and these movies rarely address complex issues that permeate our society on the other hand uses satirical techniques to make a powerful statement about the state of todays media on the whole throughout the movie several examples are given to allude to the fact that trumans entire life has all been manufactured for the entertainment of a worldwide audience like the repetition that is seen across the movie from beginning to end scenes from the beginning of the movie are repeated almost shot for shot later in the film and this really gives the viewer a sense of how synthetic the world he lives in is additionally one line manages to find its way into several key moments in the plot with each delivery providing more and more meaning behind it as both the viewer and truman gradually discover the truth this sense of discovery that is felt as the conspiracy that has been hidden from truman falls apart around him is personally an extremely interesting subject and this aspect of the film may possibly be one of my favorite parts in addition to the artificiality of the world that is seen the idea that corporations can be considered people is explored as well christof casually mentions that was the first instance of a corporation legally adopting a child christof greatly understates the significance of that event brushing it off as a mere byproduct of creating such a showlastly the film is able to tie it all together with a questioning of the ethicality of the show be warned however this paragraph will contain spoilers for the final act of the movie as truman is sailing away from seahaven christof demands that a great storm be created to stop truman from discovering the truth when he is questioned by the network executives fearing that christof might kill truman he justifies his actions by stating he was born in front of a live audience implying that its no different to let him die in front of a live audience this shows us how christof really sees truman as nothing more than part of the machine that is truman may be an important part of that machine but the point is christof barely even considers that truman is a human toothere are few movies like very rarely do movies really take the jump needed to kickstart the discussion on complex issues but this movie was willing to do so for this reason is one of the most profound movies to achieve mainstream success in recent memory are there flaws of course but the overall meaning transcends the movie which is why i give an 810,black_comedy
is a movie that shows the lies that we are told by the media although we know the internet isnt always true there are still so many false things that we choose to believe in this film the idea of a life of lies comes to life from truman burbanks birth he was in a phony reality that he was lead to believe was real and everyone he knew were actors that lied to him everyone around the world is watching truman on television 247 through secret cameras and wants him to eventually find his way out of the dome he is stuck inside whether you are young or old this movie is ridiculous and funny while adding a deeper meaning that is hidden below the surface even if you are too young to understand what the movie is trying to make you feel or if you are just laughing at the silly things truman does it is definitely worth the watchthis movie was very well thought out and kept you laughing as you were slowly coming to the conclusion of what is was really about the satirical elements are very strong and clever enough to make you think without coming right out and saying it the movie does a good job of showing how the media wants us to believe that everything is perfect in the world they want to put us in a dome like truman and not see what terrible things are really happening around us in burbanks life everything around him just happens to work out exactly right in this same way society tries to make us think that everything is just fine and there are no problems in this world when in reality we know there are whether you get the true meaning of the movie or not is very entertaining and funny while giving you an emotional connection to the characters throughout the movie it really gives you a true understanding of the influence the media has on our everyday lives and opinions,black_comedy
is a thought provoking and satirical movie about the unrealistic expectations that the media puts into our lives as a satire the movie completely inflates the perfection of a reality tv show but hits hard on how you cannot compare your life to a show because it is not necessarily always true throughout the movie truman slowly starts realizing that something isnt right that life isnt supposed to be always perfect seeming and there had to be more outside of his little town that he could never seem to leave many of us sit at home and watch reality tv shows thinking that it is real life that everything in the lives of the actors are perfect and we wonder why our lives arent that way but through the movie you start to understand the concept that behind the scenes may not be at all what you think it is there is so much more going on behind the camera than what you see on the television screen the movie uses connotation playing into the emotions of the audience members to help them sympathize with truman this helps the people viewing the movie to comprehend the harsh realities and connect to the theme and characters in the end taking away the intended purpose of the movie we see this in the world today through tv shows like keeping up with the kardashians on the screen they seem to have it made for them they can travel anywhere anytime not have to worry about money and all of their problems may seem minimal or even humorous to the audience but what we dont see is all of the behind the scenes all of the real world family problems that happen or the fact that one or more may not want their lives broadcasted for the entire population to see tries to expose these realities hoping to send a message to all viewers the movie is very enjoyable while getting its point across,black_comedy
is hilariously heartwarming set in the 90s it follow truman burbank an unassuming naive but friendly man who lives in seahaven a small town where everybody knows everybody well where everybody knows truman in reality truman is the center of a tv show that has followed him since he was born the director christof built a dome behind the hollywood sign and inside that dome is seahaven actors were hired to be trumans parents teachers and friends in fact everything around truman is fake but its real to him he has no idea that he is living in a bubble built solely around his life in the real world people can watch truman 247 and are almost addicted to watching him through life the movie begins with truman is almost 30 and is just starting to realize that things may not be as they seem in his little village of seahaven studio lights are falling from the sky a pocket of rain appears just over him and the malfunctioning radio in his car suddenly switches to a mysterious voice documenting his every move this leads to an adventure of truman trying to figure out where and who he really is despite being a lighthearted film the entire movie touches on more thoughtful themes the safeness of home and how far one clings to it the addictive nature of the media the director even suggests that the world in which we live in is corrupt and truman is being granted a gift by being shut off from reality the film is also a satire meaning that it brings to light a folly in human nature in hopes that we can change it the main problem that satirizes is the media the people in the real world are obsessed with throughout the whole movie it gives us glimpses of the people watching it and they dont seem to move their positions throughout the 72 hours of broadcast of its as if all theyve been doing in their lives has been watching this show ignoring everyday responsibilities and staying glued to the screen it exaggerates peoples dependency on tv shows but in a way it shows us the truth we binge watch tv series on netflix we watch our own reality tv shows and believe that we know the person were watching is almost ahead of its time and thats why its still enjoyable and relative today,black_comedy
is an example of satire and though the use of satire it shows how media has affected our everyday lives and has influenced us in ways that it probably shouldnt in this movie we follow the life of truman burbank who lives in the community of seahaven which is actually a giant domed television studio in seahaven truman is the star he is recorded observed and judged everyone else is actors only truman is real and he doesnt know it right away you can link to what media does to us today you can see the satirical tool inflation being used to get the point of across the problem of being lied today in media is conveyed by making lies a much bigger issue in trumans society the dome that is seahaven feeds truman lies about his whole life just as media does to us today we dont know what to believe just as truman didnt know the truth about his life christof the creator of seahaven put it best when he said we accept the reality of the world with which were presented its as simple as that and isnt it people believe what they are told to believe and this satire highlights that perfectly also brings to light the issue of morality in the media which takes place at the very end of the movie when truman finds out about his fake life he asks christof to explain christof states theres no more truth out there than there is in the world i created for you the same lies the same deceit this can be compared to our society today just like truman we dont know what our beliefs are until we are forced to question them i think that is an effective satire that is able to pinpoint an issue that is still present in our society today we are still looking for ways to solve this problem but in case we dont solve it good afternoon good evening and goodnight,black_comedy
is honestly quite a wonderful movie and i never thought how powerful a satire it was until now we go through the life of truman burbank following him along oblivious to the fact that he is being watched by millions of people on a television show and watch his conquest to find out what is going on around him the creator of this tv show in an interview said we accept the reality of the world with which were presented as the explanation to why he hadnt sought out the truth before and i think that speaks miles about what is going on in this show and the meaning in general this movie shows that we as people should always try and question the world around us and always be adventurous and quizzical because had truman never tried to figure out the truth for the reasons he did he could have gone his whole life in blissful ignorance in a world that wasnt what it seemed this movie showed that ignorance is not bliss and the truth is out there somewhere just waiting to be uncovered after watching this movie you feel the need to question things more and that shows that this was incredibly effective at doing what it did as a satire,black_comedy
this old school movie set in the late 1900s is predictable yet has several plot twisting events it starts out with a jolly guy going about his day like it is perfect he has the dream job of working behind a desk he has the perfect wife perfect house perfect neighbors everything it quickly shows his fears which provides some foreshadowing within the first couple of minutes of the movie it makes it obvious that he does the same thing every day at the exact same time with the exact same people this reason being he is the star of a 247 hit tv show the thing is he does not know this he was adopted by a tv company at birth because he was an unwanted pregnancy he is now twenty something years old who has been recorded his whole life he lives in a town called seahaven which is actually not a town at all it is a huge down with tiny cameras everywhere not only does everyone know this tv is going on but everyone is apart of it his whole life has been planned out since birth who he gets to be in love with who his best friends are who his family is who he works with everyone the whole time watching the movie you will be constantly surprised as to what will come next and even the things you think will come probably wont things start to get a little hectic and so do your thoughts as your eyes are glued to the screen,black_comedy
starts off as an unsuspecting movie truman burbank jim carrey is for all intents and purposes a normal man living a normal life white picket fence lovely wife friendly neighborhood and all like every man with everything though truman starts to suspect that theres more to life than his simple desk job and white picket fences is a masterful work that gracefully comments on various themes of life in a brilliant manner these themes include existentialism freedom of choice and the power that media holds over human life its also worth noting how much reminded me personally of the matrix both neo and truman are a sort of chosen one character type not only that but theyre both given choices to stay in the fantasy or to leave and see the world for what it really is the comparisons can even be found in the sort of captors of the two both of their captors believe that theyre doing them good by keeping them in a fantasy world where everything worksin all i believe is definitely worth a watch and provides quite a lot of thoughts,black_comedy
is a movie about truman burbank truman is an insurance salesman whose everyday life turns upside down when he figures out his life is a tv show his whole life is broadcast ed 247 to billions of people who watch across the world truman lives in a dome in hollywood california constructed by creators for the purpose of the show everyone in his life is in on the show and are actors eventually truman starts to figure out that his life is not as normal on the island of seahaven as it seemed his life instantly turns upside down as he becomes aware and he tries to find normalcy and get out of his life on the island personally i feel like this satirical film was a good movie and something i would watch again i especially appreciate the meaning and substance to this film the purpose of the film is to expose and display how the media in our society today controls and skews our perception of the world around us the fact that a form of media was produced to portray this purpose about todays media is pure irony in itself throughout the film there was exaggeration of the way todays media sells and advertises products all of the people in trumans life would continuously exaggeratedly look into the camera and display various products this displayed how we force products down peoples throat and use every opportunity to exploit them also this is shown by the creators using everything in the show to make money off of truman and his life the whole idea for this film is inflation of the issue with media in our society the writers of this movie exaggerate and make the problem huge using the plot of the film to prove and teach us that it is a big issue in our lives as consumers an interesting quote from the movie is from the creator of christof we accept the reality of the world with which we are presented its as simple as that 1998 this i feel is the main purpose of the plot and really speaks to the audience of the film which is the everyday consumer this quote really spoke to me and i hope it speaks to you too this quote really gets the point across that we need to be more skeptical of the information given by the media overall i feel like is an extremely effective form of satire and i recommend you watch it for some laughs and some new reasoning in your lives,black_comedy
i really enjoyed i felt that it satirized a problem that is both far reaching and persistent i believe it was presented in a way funny enough to be palatable to the audience while also unnerving enough to attack its target even when writing this the fear still persists that this is all one big set designed to sell your life for the viewing pleasure of a few million people i felt that the audience was anyone old enough to understand how morally reprehensible the total invasion of privacy which occurred in the film was however the target was much different the target was anyone the participates in andor propagates consumer culture as well as supporters of invasive policies allowing for the unfair surveillance of innocent people to do this the writers had to highlight the immorality of the show and present the benefits of having agency over your position the immorality of the show was easy to expose only having to show him being manipulated by his loved ones and the incompetency of the kristof the director however more importantly it showed truman as the agent of his own fate there was one specific quote in which kristof said that we could see that truman wanted to stay because if he wanted to leave then he could which was quickly followed by truman leaving that quote from kristof also reflects on the view of agency in todays society in which people who have the deck stacked against them are blamed when they cant draw a royal flush one contemporary example of this is the poor in todays society commonly people will say poor people just need to get a job and stop living off welfare however statements like this and kristofs completely leave other circumstances that are the reason why the poor people are poor and why truman took 30 years to escape such as truman was raised in a society where people were constantly telling him that the weird things happening were regular so it makes it harder for him to tell that his life isnt normal and poor people are born into broken families surrounded by drugs crime and gangs all of which make it very hard to not be poor for this reasons i would highly recommend to anyone that wants to constantly fear that they are being laughed at all around the world and also people who want to look into the complex socioeconomic problems facing the less fortunate of the world,black_comedy
is one of the most entertaining and addicting movies ive seen in long time the idea behind the story is ingenious and i love how thought out and elaborate the plot line is the moral and tone of the story targets liars and judge mental people as well as people who choose to sit back and watch things unfold rather than get involved it also teaches us a very important lesson about not exploiting others for your own personal gain this movie is a horatian satire lots of laughs and a lightheartedness to it that makes viewers unable to look away it uses many satirical devices to further the plot such as inflation and loads of irony even though this movie is over a decade old it can still resonate with todays audience because reality tv is more popular now than ever and watching every second of somebody elses life has been a rather disappointing norm in our society however our love for reality tv bridges the gap between us and and really connects with the young viewers of the world it puts into perspective just how involved we are in the lives of people that we dont even know and it shows that there are many pros and cons to being in the spotlight,black_comedy
i believe that was an effective satirical piece a clear view as to what the satire is criticizing a lasting impression on the watcher and just enough light heartedness that pulls the movie together the clear purpose of the satire is to expose the seemingly wonderful and well meaning but unintentionally benevolent nature of the media the movie shows how awful the fixation that the media carries with certain people can destroy their lives in the end whats interesting in a rather sad manner is how relevant and accurate the movie is today now more than ever the movie shows the deflation of personal privacy which now mimics how some reality tv shows are set up the movie also shows the inflation of shared interest in television which has been on the rise for a long time the movie while seemingly outdated is still a scarily accurate representation of modern societythe reaction of truman to realizing something is afoot is almost odd in this day and age he grew up without access to reality television so hes unused to how some people would crave the fame that came with his role it is almost odd to think how different his reaction may have been had he been given access to the world of televisionpersonally i enjoyed the movie the acting left something to be desired for me but the writing and setting were very satisfactory the plot was complex but not to the point that it was not understandable the humor is typical of satire but not too crude or brash which is nice i think this was a very well made movie especially for the time period,black_comedy
is a great example of a wellexecuted satire it is entertaining has an interesting storylineconcept and has a strong purpose behind it the performances by all of the actors jim carrey especially only add to this already solid film the first time i watched i was 12 years old it instantly became one of my favorite movies alongside clueless forrest gump and the amazing sixteen candles since then i have watched it probably 6 times but it somehow never seems to get old or boring and to be honest when our english teacher made us watch this movie during our satire unit i was extremely confused never had i considered that this movie was more than a cool concept with a hilarious actor now maybe i was just not a very observant andor an intelligent person at the age of 12 but i still couldnt understand why this was considered a satireas we watched the movie in class i begun to see it in a whole new light i noticed things i hadnt noticed before tried to dig deeper in order to find its purpose and most importantly tried to discover exactly why it had been given the title of satire after thinking about this long and hard i came up with that the satirical purpose behind the movie was to show how the media controls us here in america it uses inflation to exaggerate the situation truman is in on the show to help us recognize how controlling the media is not only in the movie but in our own lives as well while it may not necessarily use connotative word choicelanguage it definitely evokes emotion in all of us as we feel sorry for truman as he goes through life on a tv set it uses dramatic irony because the audience knows that trumans on a tv show before he does i think that the movie targets less of the mainstream media and more of the people sitting back and watching as our television sets and the internet take over our lives we are taught to not take things at first glance for what they seemingly are and to always question the world around us this can be related to the lies that both fox and cnn tell us on the daily about politics and whats going on around the world the people that blindly follow either news source no matter what they are saying are the true target of this movie now of course our lives arent being broadcast to the entire world but similar to truman some peoples lives are being controlled by a tv station and its our job to discover the truth and get out as christof said we accept the reality of the world with which were presentedto sum things up this movie is nothing short of a masterpiece learning the true purpose behind the movie has only made me like it more as i can appreciate the thought going into each line and scene to make it more than just entertaining i truly believe that this is a movie every person should see even if they dont necessarily agree with the purpose just because it is such a well thought out and brilliantly executed movie if you are bored on a friday night or just want to see something that will really make you think instead of just mindless tv shows please give this movie a try,black_comedy
is a satirical movie that attacks the concept of reality tv as well as the media the film begins with the seemingly average life of truman burbank but begins to make you as well as truman question the reality of it all it becomes clear that trumans whole life is a tv show and has been watched by millions of viewers since the moment he was born this satire appears to be attacking reality tv and how foolish it is it seems to provide no purpose and the film constantly shows people all over spending their lives watching somebody elses although it exaggerates as the show is on 247 and no one is shown doing anything else it even shows policemen who are continually ignoring their job to watch even though this movie came out in 1998 it also attacks the media we have today because it depicts truman as someone who is caged someone who has zero privacy and is unaware his entire life is always on display just as the media constantly follows celebrities and pries into their personal lives unrelentlessly the creator of the show responds to a call from an angry viewer saying that what theyve done to truman is not right by telling her that truman is free to leave at any time in spite of this every time truman attempts escape he is stopped by measures that get more extreme each time leading up to his car being set on fire and the producers attempt to drown him it makes it clear that they dont want truman to leave but they didnt seem to care if he died showing that producers of reality tv as well as the media do not care about who they are exploiting as long as they get a good story with lots of views i feel that this movie was effective and fun to watch even if someone is to watch this without any thought to the satirical side of the movie it would still be an enjoyable experience,black_comedy
this film was the perfect example of satire jim carrey perfectly portrays a man whose entire life is a lie and everyone else knows it he lives on an island where hes being constantly recorded and broadcasted at all times and all of his loved ones are actually actors pretending to be friends and family as you root for him to discover the truth and break free of his prison you find yourself disgusted at the people who enjoy his show yet as you think about it its what everyone does with their reality tv shows this movie was able to criticize the media yet still keep the story somewhat light by adding humorous bits throughout walking away from the film i felt conflicted on whether or not it was funny or not but isnt that the point of satire to entertain but also provoke thought this movie perfectly achieved this overall this movie was able to provide a gripping story as we try and see truman escape from the only home hes ever known but make us question ourselves and what we prioritize in life this is a movie that i would recommend for anyone who needs a laugh or is looking for a little soul searching,black_comedy
truman lives in a perfectly perfect town called seahaven or so that is what he has been told his whole life in reality truman is living in a large tv studio and has been since birth everyone else knows this except for him tiny cameras are placed all around the town filming his every move of every day 24 hours a day 7 days a week and 365 days a year this footage is live streamed on tv as but what happens when truman begins to notice that everything in his perfect town is just a little bit too perfect and a little bit too repetitive starring jim carrey uses satirical elements to comment on actual society connotation is used throughout dialogue to inflict the fake and awkward feelings on the citizens of the town the way they speak makes you feel annoyed with the situation instead of being in support of it like most characters in the movie the movie targets americans as a whole in a comedic and ironic way overall the movie comments on the way society is so attached to media and that in some ways it completely controls americans lives,black_comedy
in this movie truman burbank played by jim carrey is living a fake life however this is ironic because he has no idea that it is fake i thought this was a great idea for a movie because he is living in a studio with hidden cameras everywhere and everyone around him are actors playing their role while truman has no idea has everyone around the world watching truman thinks he is a normal man living a normal life and he has no idea that he is being filmed this film can be seen as a satire because they are targeting the falseness of modern entertainment truman simply lives his life but just like the popular tv shows survivor or big brother everything on set is fake since the power of media is so strong the audience of or a show like survivor think that everything is real this movie is trying to show us how fake modern entertainment can actually be but the power of the media makes us think it is real the whole time i watched the movie i wanted truman to break free of this false media i never thought he would until one day truman finds out something is wrong what will he do,black_comedy
was a very interesting movie i liked a lot because the more you thought about it the more meaning it could have but it also made you laugh at first i was really confused and it seemed pretty weird as the movie went on the more things started clicking together it was really well thought out when you really watch it you can see what they want to change the message is still relevant if not more now the media is all around us and sometimes its hard to tell if theyre real or not and if theyre for us or against us we need to break free from the lies of the media and live our own life irony was used many times it was ironic when the creator christof said that he guarded his privacy and the other news caster said that it was understandable they completely violate trumans privacy by broadcasting his life to the whole entire world 247 it was ironic that the people who were cast to do certain jobs could not actually do those jobs in real life which emphasized the point of just how fake his life really was hyperbole was also a main asset in the movie they exaggerated everything in trumans daily life by making it a bigger event ethos was used because you feel really bad for truman it makes you want to stop the media and directors too which is the point of the whole movie overall it was a great movie with a great message,black_comedy
one of the best performance by jim carrey along side liar liarwhen i was a kid i to thought the same as carrey seeing that idea on screen was shocking but the film is amazingly scripted and each of the actor did their best amazing story with an amazing cast made the movie a epic and this movie would be on my film list till i die and i recommend each and every person to see this the intensity in each and every scene was watch worthy and i say no one would feel bored seeing this spectacular motion picture i recommend not to see dumb and dumber2 because it degrades the range of jimnow at first the film is slow but dont quit the movie pace increases as the movie goes on salute to jim,black_comedy
everyone at some point in their lives has been bothered by the notion that their surroundings are all an elaborate prank that somehow every single human being but them is in on some giant impossible joke watching their every move for strange and unthinkable purposes what if my life isnt real what if all my friends and family members arent who they say they are and im just part of some ungodly social experiment what if my life as ive known it just isnt real for truman burbank jim carrey these concerns are very pressing as he discovers throughout one of the most thoughtful touching creative and insightful films ever made director peter weir works with a script by andrew niccol to bring us this now timeless tale of a man existing in a patented pastel world that was never his own and always destined for him truman is the unwitting star of his own television show inducted into its gargantuan studio set since the day of his birth and conditioned to believe all his life that the people places and events around him are in fact his real life cruel perhaps but the film never takes sides instead favoring wonder over analytical dissection a wise move even the conductor of this whole absurd symphony a prolific filmmaker played by ed harris gets his moment of sympathy which can be read as preening ego or the desire to connect with his leading actor beyond the pixelated jumbo tron he sits behind depending on how you view the situation truman has a lovely wife laura linney a salt of the earth best friend noah emmerich and the perfect little white picket fence life but none of it is real or at least organic in the sense that every person deserves out of the womb truman is a rat in a very elaborate maze but like anyone whos had the wool pulled over their eyes eventually he begins to see lights of authenticity piercing the seams gradually he begins to sniff out the ruse like a child losing their innocence and questions the eerily idyllic life he has been given the people or rather actors in his life react in different ways some panic others stick to the script and harris sorrowfully watches his controversial creation awaken beyond his control carrey is a starry eyed revelation as truman in one of the most overlooked performances of the century his arc is the stuff of dreams spanning the lengths of naivete trapped in a bubble that bursts into affecting starry eyed realization and wonder every moment is owned by him every beat is resoundingly hit in flawless fashion when a mysterious and beautiful defector the luminous natasha mcelhone enters his life to play the part of whistleblower its the first genuine and nonpuppeteered interaction hes had with a human being sparks fly high enough to reach the heavens and its the catalyst for a journey to find the self the reason for his predicament a world beyond the lego brick suburbia he has known and the next step in his impossibly unique life theres a piece of truman embedded in every viewer beholding and i believe thats why the film has held up for so long and been beloved by so many every human being has insecurities as large as the fake sound stage that raised him from a pup every one of us has at one point felt the alienation he must have gone through upon realizing the truth in a story so larger than life we find the answers or at least a modicum of such to what it means being a person in this world carreys truman is an achingly relatable avatar of this and a direct conduit into the essential couldnt have picked a better actor to bring all of this to life couldnt have made a better film about it a classic good morning and in case i dont see you good afternoon good evening and goodnight,black_comedy
comedy is a barren wasteland its mostly populated with bad actors in good roles adam sandler ben stiller or fantastic actors in terrible roles robert de niro joe pesci however once in a while a movie defies all that once in a while people come together to make a piece of comedy that is truly great filmmaking it happened in silver linings joy and what about bob and it happened herefrom the director of dead poets society another dramedy with a comedy actor comes this beautiful tale of truman something when i saw this movie i did not think it was about what it was about i thought it was more along the lines of good morning vietnam but instead this movie acts like inception and in a great way too its thoughtprovokingtheres a moral dilemma in this film and thats the idea that the viewer is trying desperately to cast the blame at first it doesnt even seem like its necessarily an evil thing to do i mean his life is made to be great but as the film progresses its clear truman is being made a victim but whos the villain here the catch is its hard to tell is it ever actor and actress on that show for putting up with it is it christophs for designing it it is his parents for allowing the show to adopt him or is it everyone watching giving the show high ratings to make them keep going the film has a deep undertone saying if we give publicity to people we hate and a system we hate is it just proving that their system works and that message rings truer than ever in the desolate landscape of politics we live inbut all that thoughtprovoking stuff is peppered by jim carrey in what is ill just say it far and away his best work ever and it proves that this world has something against carrey by constantly putting him in roles that are so incredibly poorly written and just say act stupid and you feel like youre watching a terrible movie this movie proves that hes a real actor he can give real performances if the writers will for once give him the chance to act once in a whilebut there are things that prevented this movie from getting those last two starsthe first is a lot of little oversights like the cinemasins kind i usually dont care but there were just so many here i wont list them all but the most bothersome one is that they claim to have the worlds smallest cameras and yet when meryl gets scared she knows exactly where the camera is to look into it theres about six more i could list but i wontthe second and more important is christophs character i get that hes a little hypocritical but still theres a lot of who is this guy with christoph not in a good way in a bad way like it doesnt seem like the same guy would do all the different things he did and say all the different things he said in this moviethat being said this is one of the nicest movie reviews ive ever given this truly is one of the greatest comedies to ever hit the small screen and jim carrey can call it his masterwork,black_comedy
the trumans show is a rare gem of the 90s it is very different from the movies that we usually see normally in movies actors know that they are acting while following a script while technically this movie may be called as one of them but the story itself is dramatically ironic the movie starts a bit slow and boring at first but gradually draws interest of the viewer after interval in this movie jim carrey playing as truman burbank oblivious of his star identity lives a normal life in a confined set created by the producer of the trumans show right from the birth truman finds himself in the artificial world with artificial people without realising that he is actually acting on 247 show broadcasted live featuring him as the star his every action every moment was recorded on camera however lately he falls in love with her mate sylvia in college owing to love she tries to aware truman of the reality by taking him away to a far stretch of land not seen by camera was she able to unravel the truth what about the troubles that you apprehend did she save him i am not going to tell the entire story now just know that love triumphs all and watch the movie yourselfthe film tries to discover convergence between reality vs drama and marvells at its attempt although i feel that a better plot with could have done justice with the overall concept of the movie the movie yearns for lost comedy and songs i recommend this movie to the audience because its one of a kind but with a disclaimer to be prepared to get bored for most of it,black_comedy
was an interesting movie with a good initial plotit was a great movie idea that made me look at life from a different perspective it makes you think differently and expands your awareness and observations made it was a simple idea  but effective the film seemed like a dream it seemed as though truman was dreaming it all  which has an effect on the audience and makes them feel the same waythis film is quite old therefore it doesnt seem that realistic the island in which truman was living was also quite unrealisticto improve the movie the truman island could have been more realistic so it was harder for him to figure out that it was a showit would have also helped if his day to day life was a bit more interesting to increase the action and tension levels all in all its a classic worth watching despite the improvements that could be made to suit the more modern world since this was made in 1998,black_comedy
i have seen so many times and i consider it one of my alltime favorite movies it has such a simplistic feel to it but it is loaded with satire and profound meaning this is jim carreys best performance in any of his films by far surpassing his performance in eternal sunshine of the spotless mind truman burbank is the star of his own reality tv show and he doesnt even know it he is the first star born on set and legally adopted by a tv show weve all felt the sensation that this cant be happening to me i must be getting punked but for truman this is his whole life with a great cast and clever plot director peter weir weaves together a masterpiece the movie points out the insatiable nature of tv viewers aka us and the extent that producers and directors will go to please their audience forget morals forget peoples feelings or reputations we want to be entertained weir compares us to the romans just as the romans craved entertainment at the expense of gladiators we crave entertainment at the expense and reputation of tv stars athletes and regular people how far is society willing to go and at what cost asks this of its audienceif you have not seen this movie you must it is just as if not more applicable now than it was when the movie was released in 1998,black_comedy
from the moment we are old enough to grab a marker with our small fingers we toy with the idea of creating our own world within this one artists are simply the lucky ones who manage to grow up while retaining the possibility of making a living out of the creative act but the idea of playing god is inherent to all of us so much that the idea that we are simply part of a bigger creation is deeply ingrained within our cultural genomatakes this to the ultimate end the possibility of creating an entire world from scratch the possibility of playing with someones life and control it in every single extent it is noteworthy how such an experiments ends up looking an awful lot like george orwells 1984 in the end god might not be much more than just a benevolent totalitarian dictatorthe resemblance to platos allegory of the cave is quite clear and as such it is not hard to figure out what will happen once truman begins to notice that his everyday life is simply shadows cast on the wall of the cave no matter how much the creator tries to distract him the idea is already incepted in his brain he will try to leave the cavebut the notion that the outer world outside the cave is our own world is somewhat disturbing one tends to think of platos allegory of the cave as a quest for the utopian but if the world outside the cave is our own dirty and imperfect world wouldnt it make more sense to remain in the cave confronting ourselves with the real world will render all quest for the ideal futile no wonder the existentialist had such a hard time once they denied the existence of god the only thing left to do then is to turn the allegory of the cave upside down if the outer world is so imperfect we might look for perfection within our own personal caves which is what creators dois a very engaging movie that tricks us with its looks of yet another jim carrey blockbuster only to have us trapped into a thoughtprovoking experience that will keep us awake at night it is a turning point in carreys career in which he proves that laughs is not the only thing he can provoke in the viewers it is a movie full of hope that encourages all of us to leave our own personal caves,black_comedy
jim carrey stars in as he plays the main character a guy who discovers his entire life is actually the object of a most successful and universal tv series the metaphor is very very potent in this one so much goes into criticizing our current publicitypromotion oriented society governed and determined by money where man is turned into either a slave carrey or a machine this film is a big big eyeopener on what freewill has become in our societies freewill which we supposedly have more of now than ever before in our history this film is quite subtle pays attention to detail well enough and delivers an incredible metaphor that seems too great for anyone to miss out on just one of these main essential ideas that shouldve been made before but wasnt and now this is it right here and you have to watch it oh and although it makes for a great watch a very entertaining eventful catchy watch  the ending is clearly a level above the whole thing,black_comedy
is a very interesting film most of youll know the plot well so i wont stop summing it up the story is not too complicated funny and yet with some melodramatic sadness this strange melanchony is carried on through the entire filmvisual effects arent really memorable but the entire films concept makes the thing outstand jim carreys performance adds to whatevers left out of the film ed harris delivers nicely his character too next to that homever the ending didnt feel completely satisfying and the music was not memorable at alltheres not too much to tell go watch this film and youll understand the feeling it gives,black_comedy
i came across a few years back i had heard about it and knew it starred jim carrey so i assumed it was another comedy full of jim carrey beingwell jim carreyboy what a punch to the gut when i saw truman show it stuck with me for days to this day i easily call it one of my all time favorite filmsthe film with a pretty simple plot is entertaining from start to finish although billed as a comedydrama this is without a doubt a dramacarreys performance here is absolutely astonishing he plays an extremely likable average joe working for an insurance company albeit the star of his own tv show which he doesnt knowthe acting is top notch and the film itself is emotional and spine tingling add to that excellent direction strong supporting performances and a beautiful score and you have one hell of a filmthat being said the film itself belongs to carrey he carries the film with such ease and emotion trying to find himself in the world and be with the woman he has been in love withif you are not a fan of jim carrey and him being the star sways you i urge you to watch this film it will change your life and your opinion of jim carrey as an actor1010,black_comedy
is about a man whose whole life is a reality tv program but he himself did not know it everyone around him all the people he had ever met and met on a daily basis were only actors and actresses the whole world had seen him born and they followed all of his stage of life ever since from the first step he ever took to the day he got married with his wife who also happens to be just acting her part in this show the film plot begins to develop when truman begins to gradually find weird things happen around him he starts to go paranoid and believes people are following him truman shows directors are trying painfully to keep him in check that he would not go beyond the script excessively as the film approaches towards the end this task is becoming increasingly difficult when truman continues to test his limits and the doubt about the reality in which he lives increases the film is gripping you are anticipating the whole time what weird things he discovers happening next and how is he going to react in such situations it is easy to keep interest until the end of the movie,black_comedy
i was really surprised that didnt get more recognition back when it came out this is one of the most original and best screenplays ive had the pleasure of watching i have hard time describing this movie its not exactly a dram or a true comedy but the feel has a little of both there is a uniqueness to that everyone should enjoy peter weir took the topic of the media and made his point without feeling forced weirs style fit perfectly with this kind story i dont understand how jim carey and ed harris didnt get more for their performances jim carrey has been in plenty of over the top slapstick roles but this is not one of them his humor came out subtly and perfectly this is by far his best performance harris was also fantastic and played his villainous role well how didnt these two get recognized back thenis a phenomenal and extremely underappreciated no way around that there is a fantastic story and meaning behind this and it was presented perfectly 910,black_comedy
have you ever had the suspicious feeling you were being watched or followed by someone this fear plays a primal in this funny and thoughtprovoking sciencefiction comedydrama set in an alternate reality that tackles on the culture of celebrities directed by peter weir this film stars jim carrey as truman burbank a white collar worker living an average life with this wife meryl burbank played by laura linney but dreams of becoming an explorer and taking his wife on a vacation to fiji soon truman begins to encounter some strange events including visions of his father kirk burbank played by brian delate who was lost at sea during a violent storm when he was a child and suspicious behavior by local residents around him truman eventually comes to realize that his world is not what it seems as he is unaware that his life is 24hour reality television show created by television producer christof played by ed harris with an audience of millions of people around the world truman sets out on a quest to learn the truth of his lifenot many movies come as original nor inventive as this one this film sparks an exceptionally intelligent idea and brings it to life with some mesmerizing performances ingenious writing and themes that electrify deep imagination unlike in his usual comedic work like dumb and dumber and ace ventura jim carrey breaks away from his goofy screwball typecasting and takes on a slightly more dramatic in this thoughtprovoking drama while managing to squeeze out some laughs here and there he is very energetic in his role and gives one of the most refined performances of his career hes always funny during the right moments and always sincere during the more serious moments and his character is someone you cant help but love laura linney who plays his wife is also very charming in her role and her chemistry with jim carrey works well but the biggest gem comes from ed harriss portrayal as christof the television producer behind the longrunning reality show that is the main characters life he is a very interesting character and diligently written a character who conveys a godlike resemblance as he is the creator of trumans life so yeah there is a small religious theme in the story and it works very gooddirector peter weir and writer andrew niccol bring quite a vision to this movie they take quite an innovative idea and do many clever things with it the movie takes an interesting direction and tackles many thoughtfilled themes including metaphilosophy simulated reality and existentialism these are best demonstrated as the titular character experiences strange occurrences around him and tries to make sense of them unaware of the shocking revelation about his life when he suspects the world changing him he begins the test his boundaries one scene for example where he tries to drive off a bridge then there are some scenes cutting to some recurring characters sitting in front of their television watching as truman is subconsciously broadcasted via hidden cameras this idea leads to commentary of the culture of celebrities and media officials effort on exposing details on the private lives of individuals the entire concept is of the film is very thoughtprovoking and powerful enough to leave viewers with a paranoid feeling but at the same time pokes fun at itself with some laughter and clever charactersis truly a remarkable film sparkled with such an original idea and an incredible script this is definitely that will appeal to many jim carrey fans including adults and maybe preteens viewers should not go into this movie expecting a straight laugh outloud comedy like most of jim carreys films there are some dramatic and emotional moments from time to time overall this movie is something worth watching,black_comedy
is a marvel of engineering great cast high concept but its the overall illusion thats really impressive that it somehow all works if you really wanted to poke holes in this movie you could the enormous resources required to maintain that dome the ungodly costs and that doesnt even touch the subject of prostituting meryl but the script is adept at addressing such concerns or at least sweeping them under the rug you find yourself absorbed in trumans inner struggle and his blossoming sense of adventure this is probably my favorite jim carrey performance hes ideal ed harris too geez what cant that guy do the movies premise of reality tv isnt new and im not sure it was even back in 98 but its honestly an imaginative take on the whole concept and maintains a surprising level of depththe truth is there arent all that many 90s movies that hold up on rewatch but this one absolutely does910,black_comedy
truman was the first serious movie id ever seen from jim carreyheck it may have been his first noncomedy period this movie was stunning what was so amazing was the fact that they let you in on the secret pretty early instead of leaving it as a twist so instead of finding out at the end of the movie that it was all staged we find out relatively early which leaves us something else to look forward to will he ever find out and if he does what will he do carrey was great as the simple small town happy character he brought the character to life which made it all work truman couldnt be a skeptic he couldnt be a big dreamer he couldnt even be a roamer he had to be the exact type of character he was for it all to work truman the fictitious show worked and truman the movie worked,black_comedy
my mother let me watch the cassette for this film on my 10th birthdayshe knew how mind upsetting this film might have been when it came out there was a psychological phenomenon associated topeople thinking to be observed and followed by cameras 247 and for a long time after watching this film i suffered myself of this condition whenever i was looking at the mirror a tiny part of my mind was acting as there was someone else watchingi am sure george orwell would have been extremely proud of andrew niccol,black_comedy
if your looking for a jim carrey comedy you have looked at the wrong film is funny yes but the jokes are not the whole film this movie dives head first into the mind of a person who just wants to be free of his life and yes there is a twist hes in a tv show but even if we are not in a tv show like that we still want to be free and this movie really makes us think about our freedom there was no problems with this movie it is a underrated masterpiece that everyone should watch i cannot believe that this movie was not given a best picture nomination at the oscars but the true crime of the oscars is not giving jim carrey the love he deserves as an actor this should have been his oscar jim carrey gives us a complex character with layers of depth to him but at the same time he makes a character that we can all relate to a man who just wants to be free,black_comedy
i remember watching this movie as a kid and being really captivated by it watching it again now as an adult made me really appreciate films like this the concept and idea of this film makes it really captivating its interesting how this film and pleasantville came out at the same time while pleasantville is about going into the fairytale land and making a difference this one is about a man trying to leave the fairytale land it isnt as magical as it was when i saw it as an adult but i now appreciate it more for what it is after having some life experiences of my own its about not conforming to the same routine about taking risks to sometimes be able to leave the comfort zone in order travel abroad and have experiences that are beyond where you are at how some people can try to restrain you from exploring and and take away chances you dreamed of and how its your choice when it comes to what you really want to do with your life despite the really farfetched and a ridiculous concept this film has it accomplished what it tried to do jim carrey was at his peak when it came to stardom and was the topnotch actor at the time and he was the perfect choice for this role at the time as well overall this the style of films i miss now a days i highly recommend this one8110,black_comedy
originality is really important jim carreyto get the real meaning that this movie present to us you have to see it with another eyes new ones because in this movie is written the human being itself in an only manwe accept the reality of the world with which we are presented its as simple as thatmy personal opinion is that if you are really criticizing this movie you arent really seeing the wonderful incredible and creative story that composeits unique,black_comedy
you might have thought about a conspiracy theory before the movie truman show released in 1998 is such a story directed by peter weir who is famous for dead poets society this fabulous conspiracy is conveyed to audiences by its impressive lead actor jim carrey because the main character is played by jim carrey who is one of the most cheerful actors in hollywood there is feeling of melancholy in the end of the moviethe story takes place in a city called sea heaven truman berbank jim carrey is a normal insurance planner ever since he saw his father pass away in the sea he has had a fear of the water so he never thinks of going over the sea he is living his life as he has always done everyday however one day he meets his dead father on the street his father suddenly gets taken somewhere by two strange men after that he starts to doubt his life finally he figures out that everything around him is very strange after he feel that he begins fighting back to the situationthere are two memorable points in this movie first the movie actualizes a situation that people may have dreamed of the city where truman was born and grew up was a perfect setting for the show furthermore all the people around him were actors who deceived him to believe that the set is a real world even his wife because the story is based on common conspiracy theory it could draw sympathy from audiences secondly jim carrey shows that he is not just a light comedian he proves that he can tell a serious story however it doesnt mean he acts depressed he delivers the message which is worth considering while he still acts humorouslyif you see this movie you may not feel very comfortable when end credits roll truman show keeps us thinking about life skeptically however we feel something warm after the movie if you are hesitating which kind of movie between comedy and drama choosing this movie would be perfect then truman will welcome you with his characteristic greeting good morning in case i dont see ya good afternoon good evening and good night,black_comedy
there is a different ways to see this movie and explain it some of them relate it to god and existence but for me its more about how to overcome the fears that stops you from doing what you wanna do or being the person you want  your past experiencehow live taught you to play it safe not to take the risks what people expect from you and how they keep telling you who you are  and how they think that they know you but they never put a camera in your head  but actually what is preventing you from doing what you want is you and your mind you just have to get the will to achieve what you want cause yeah its hard  everyone fear the unknown and doesnt want to let people down and you dont know after you change whatever they gonna like you or notbut you have to leave all of that behind and get out of your island of fearscause it worth it,black_comedy
is an incredible funny and thought provoking satirical movie this movie shows you how strongly media influences us through showing you the reality of someone whose whole life is built by the entertainment industry one of my favorite parts about this movie is its use of satire i would recommend this movie to anyone as it teaches a valuable lesson that everyone stands to gain from learningmany satirical tools are used in to deepen the meaning of the movie there is a lot of connotation in the film for instance the character christof has many underlying biblical references christof is portrayed as godlike in many ways first of all his name has christ in it also christofs office is on a very high floor and people tend to think of god as in the highest of all places furthermore when people talk about christof they tend to use names that are typically used to describe god for example when truman comments about the beautiful sunset to marlin marlin gives all the credit to christof by saying that it is the work of the big guy up there the religious connotation of christof is used to show how we tend to worship television celebrities in magazines and all other forms of media and the people in them irony is another tool that is geniously used in to develop the satire situational irony is used to provoke humor in many scenes such as when truman goes to the travel agency and sees posters of planes crashing all over the walls this is to dissuade truman from leaving seahaven however it is also very ironic as posters exposing the dangers of travel are the last thing you would expect to see in a travel agencythis movies lesson about the way too large role of media in our society is an incredibly valuable piece of knowledge in fact the importance of this lesson seems to grow with time as it could almost be considered more relevant nowadays than it was when the movie was originally made this is because in the last decade we have only increased the role that media plays in our lives overall this movie is a great and hilarious satirical film that exposes how much media influences our lifestyle choices,black_comedy
one of the most sinister but still humorous satirical movies to date shows an actual world of reality tv with an obvious target of reality tv shows and their viewing audience this movie uses numbers of satirical tools to take stabs at what is a problem in the us and the world from inflating the idea of advertisement in shows to the immense amount of irony including a show filled with actors pretending not to be actors carefully pinpoints the silliness of reality tv this movie is also still extremely significant to todays world of reality tv one show that comes to mind is the bachelor the bachelor is viewed with much the same fanaticism as is viewed with in the movie the bachelor even has much the same concept as people trying to do normal things in front of millions of people even ends with a scene that is very similar to my sisters after the season end of the bachelor the show is treated like a life or death moment for them then five minutes after the show is done they seem to forget about its existence overall a great movie that includes concepts that can even be used in present day,black_comedy
this horatian satirical film illustrates the overly dramatic inflated version of reality tv as we follow the main character truman played by the always hilarious jim carreythroughout his daily endeavors truman illustrates to the target people who film reality tv and the audience anyone who watches or participates in the making of reality tv that being a part of a tv show that is about youre life will make it become youre life truman shows us that reality tv is more often than not nothing like real life in real life you dont get youre own individual raincloud people dont look straight into a camera people dont get escorted away for nothing and believe it or not people dont parachute from the sky to tell you youre on a show this movie though it was made a few years ago still applies to shows we have today to name a few keeping up with the kardashians dance moms big brother and survivor all share unrealistic traits but are still real enough to qualify as reality tv i think thats all i can really write about so in case i dont see you good afternoon good evening and goodnight ,black_comedy
is a satire showing the scrutiny actors and actresses undergo the movie executes showing this issue by taking it to the extreme and filming trumans life 247 without his knowledge although was written in 1998 the problems the satire is exposing are still pertinent today today with all of the new technology we have these issues are even more prominent stars cant go anywhere without something being tweeted posted or a news report about the latest thing theyve done overall i enjoyed this satire and i think it really helped open my eyes to just how much stress todays and past celebrities are put under to keep up their appearances for the media not only was a good satire but it was a good movie as well i was entertained throughout the whole thing trying to unravel the mystery behind trumans life and what was really going on it was fun trying to piece it all together and it never got boring i also really liked that it was comical and lighthearted without being childish i would recommend to anyone looking for a fun and witty movie,black_comedy
this movie in my opinions is an example of horatian satire it plays off of two human follies the want to control everything and our interest in things we have no business knowing things about it uses deflation to make the incessant need for control seem normal by making it a tv show that everybody watches and also inflation at the same time by controlling every aspect of a mans life but this also displays another human folly by showing that people often have an interest things they have shouldnt know about just because they are human and that is just a part of human nature this is still prevalent to today because these issues are part of human nature and likely will never go away but people might eventually learn to control themselves and suppress these aspects but in all this is the message that humans are messed up beings that we all have our faults and that we will never change,black_comedy
is an interesting example of satire that is interesting and entertaining the movie is about a man who was raised on the set of a tv show and knows of nothing else i found the beginning confusing as did others i know but after half an hour to an hour it will all fall into place and make sense the satire in this piece is several layers thick and much can be drawn from it one of the main points is the comment on television one of the things mentioned about what makes the show so entertaining is that truman isnt acting and is thus very real to watch this says some stuff into how tv at least at the time was not too relatable another comment was about how if it was too real that can be weird and not relatable some of the deeper stuff later without spoiling too much a comment is made by the director about how the real world is the twisted sick place and the studio where truman is is what the world should be like this is a comment on how people perceive the world and how people look at their own work it is interesting he sees the world he created as the perfect version of the world a vision of how it should be another message i drew from it was a comment on big brother spying whether it was intended i saw in the presence of so many cameras a comment on privacy invasions made by the government im not sure if im drawing conclusions that arent there but as well as being entertained i drew a good number of comments on society from this movie,black_comedy
is about a man who has had every second of his life caught on camera he was born into a reality tv show where everybody is in on it except him early on in the movie truman begins to suspect that something is up throughout the film he tests his boundaries and tries to understand his surroundings this movie is incredibly frustrating the first time that you watch it but the next time and the next time it is amazing once you understand the story then there are so many minute details that are hilarious being a satire this movie is most enjoyable once you figure out the deeper meaning this movie demonstrates irony throughout one of if not the first lines talks about how everything is completely real and what not but in reality the only real thing is truman the film aims to change the lack of privacy given to celebrities and reality tv show stars,black_comedy
this movie was very well put together when you are done watching it you want more it relates so highly to society today and how we constantly want to see famous people and catch them in their everyday life and paparazzi and tabloids make their reality our entertainment which is the main problem of this satire this movie definitely seems to be more closely a horatian satire rather than juvenalian mainly because it is very upbeat and laid back there are lots of innuendos that relate to the things we do in our everyday life the author uses a type of irony called blame by praise by showing that the world he lives in is derived to be this happy perfect place when in comparison to real life its not the target of this film is most likely paparazzi and the people all around the world who get too caught up in knowing every little thing about every famous persons life the film catches truman living his everyday life unaware of the fact that everyone is watching it is a remarkably entertaining movie which sparks a lot of questions in your mind all truman wants to be free free of broadcast free of judgment and free to find himself,black_comedy
this movie is a satire of modern media and its encapsulating effect on the general public at the beginning it is mentioned that is not just a job it is a way of life this is true for the audience of the show as they are seen spending all their lives watching this show one man is watching it in the bath a whole bar is dedicated to the show running it all day every day people have truman show memorabilia people freak when the show stops airing for a small while when truman is first found to have escaped even when the show does come to an end they just decide to watch something else their lives revolve around the tv the show sucks them into this world you are even shown this by the problem itself you want truman to leave as do the people in the movie you feel what truman feels want what truman wants and see what truman sees this movie is an example of the thing its satirizing the audience in the movie is a mirror of yourself when you watch it the issue of the humanity or lack thereof in the movie is deflated making you not think about how truman is practically a zoo animal we do this to unwilling tv stars all the time when someone gets famous we want to know everything they do we make them an exhibit for us to watch that was trumans entire life yet the issue is glossed over until it is brought up by his lost love of course the entire piece is an inflation of tv in general it takes the ideas of reality television and the moneyhungry industry and takes it to an extreme it takes a few wellplaced jabs at the entire television industry and at the viewers but it does fall a bit short first of all it is a movie it is the media that it wants to bring attention to this makes you wonder if the movie was actually made to bring attention to the corruptness of the industry or if it simply found another way to make money off of us and bring attention to itself second of all the movie itself is not that satirical you have to dig to find it and even when you do the satire never goes very deep you the viewer have to add your own thoughts to make it truly satirical the movie never blatantly states that is has issues with anything this could just be a wellwritten story that just so happens to be satirical at times finally this is just another work following a generic storyline weve heard countless times before a character grows up in a utopian controlling society he slowly learns about some major flaw in this utopian world and his wish to leave is brought about as he learns about how corrupt the world he lives in is his wish grows he eventually tries to leave only to be stopped by those he loves the society itself and the creator or ruler of said society he will overcome this and leave only to join the real world or start their own modeled after today this movie is a conversation piece but one youll soon forget about if it is not constantly brought up,black_comedy
in my comm arts class we were learning about satire so we watched this movie i thought it was very good personally it was a great story about how a man can be born on a movies set where his whole life is fake the movie pokes fun at reality tv and how they can change what really happens to something that would be interesting to viewers it made you feel bad for truman because he was trapped in a little town built inside a studio for the whole world to watch on a television screen this story was definitely horatian satire because it was humorous and although it was sometimes dark it was meant to be funny i am very glad i watched this movie it was very entertaining and was a great example of a satire,black_comedy
is a hilarious satirical film starring jim carrey as truman burbank in the movie trumans life although truman is not aware is actually a television show which is being filmed in the giant dome that he lives in where everyone is an actor and everything is part of a set throughout the whole movie truman becomes more and more suspicious that something is going on and he tries to find out what it is besides being funny pokes lighthearted fun at society and while the movie was released in 1988 the satire is still very pertinent today in the movie it is clear how captivates the world to the point where it is all the people can focus on this targets not just people from the past but our own society today the ongoing question throughout the movie is will truman find his way out shouldnt he get to have a choice whether he stays or leaves that is what makes so enthralling a light hearted comedy with still some more thoughtprovoking themes is definitely worth a watch,black_comedy
was a fantastically written story that keeps the watcher transfixed till the very end the setup of the actors and the camera angles really did make it feel like there was something weird going on behind the scenes there wasnt a moment where i was bored watching it the moment i realized what was going on i was astonished its amazing how the satirical intent of the movie is very modern and can still be applied to todays entertainment industry it made me reevaluate how i saw the industry as a whole as well as the media that surrounds it the movie redefined what a private life was and targeted the entertainment industry and reporters that broadcast the private lives of those who are famous for a living the movie made me realize that those involved in the entertainment industry dont really have a private life that they can hide from the world satirical elements such as irony was used when things in were described to be real and not staged there was inflation when they portrayed the idea of having no private life because in real life no one is actually filmed 247 and deflation was used to build the world making seem like a normal thing overall the movie was an entertaining piece and a fantastic satire that got its point across to the audience,black_comedy
is a satirical piece about reality television the satire has a bit of merit today because lots of people today watch at least one reality television show people who watch reality television often do not think about the effects that this show has on its stars is a good satire because it uses many satirical techniques uses connotation when the lady is calling the show to try and free truman she uses the word cell to try and convince people that the director of is holding truman captive and that truman would want to leave is targeting the watchers and developers of reality television and saying that they should stop making reality television is a hyperbole of the making of reality television because they greatly exaggerate the number of people and the amount on equipment that they need in the show the director says it takes the work force of a small country to run the show the show also has a good bit of comedy there are multiple lines that make the story seem very funny truman has lots of funny little jokes to keep the mood lighthearted did have its worse moments the show was not the best in the beginning because at first the story doesnt make tons of sense the beginning has the director introducing the show but its the director of which is watched by people in the movie if you do not previously know that the movie is a satire then you will have trouble understanding the beginning the story does not make much sense until about halfway through the movie also some of the people watching the show seemed very out of place people today watch lots of reality television shows some examples are keeping up with the kardashians dance moms and the bachelor these are some highly viewed shows is still relevant today because of these shows this satire is something that might need to be remade with todays technology because lots of younger kids will dismiss it the real thing that makes it something worth remaking is really just the technology the fashion and the lifestyle is relevant today but just could use some modernizing for younger people who are too young to understand this lifestyle,black_comedy
is founded on an enormous secret that all of the studios advertising has been determined to reveal i didnt know the secret when i saw the film and was able to enjoy the little doubts and wondering that the filmmakers so carefully planted trumans world is controlled by a tv producer named christof ed harris whose control room is high in the artificial dome that provides the sky and horizon of seahaven he discusses his programming on talk shows and dismisses the protests of those including sylvia who believe truman is the victim of a cruel deception meanwhile the whole world watches trumans every move and some viewers even leave the tv on all night as he sleepsthe trajectory of the screenplay is more or less inevitable truman must gradually realize the truth of his environment and try to escape from it its clever the way hes kept on his island by implanted traumas about travel and water as the story unfolds however were not simply expected to follow it were invited to think about the implications about a world in which modern communications make celebrity possible and inhuman,black_comedy
at first this movie comes across as quite comedic with very few hints as to what the underlying theme truly is truman burbank played by jim carrey is a happy and well known denizen of a coastal town called seahaven his neighbors and co workers are all great colleagues and friends and he appears to have no enemies after multiple uncanny events he soon becomes paranoid and believes that he is being watched which is dramatically ironic considering the circumstances that he is being watched as he learns more and more about the reality of his world he is quick to attempt an escape consequently the actors playing as the rest of the inhabitants of the island try to sway him away from his beliefs but fail in their efforts towards the end of the movie he flees from the view of the cameras and tries to sail to freedom in a conflict between ethics and profits the producer tries to kill truman before he can reach the exit reluctantly he is able to break out of the lie of the world that he lived inas the plot developed the true purpose of this movie emerged the director of this movie inflated the issue of what the media does in a desperate attempt to increase their viewers the fictional producer adopted an unwanted baby which is good but in hindsight they enslaved him for the entertainment of millions in note of the producers the satire also addresses the argument of utilitarianism very few people rebel against the philosophy of entrapping an individual within a madeup world because the benefit of the majority is valued more than that of the individual even though this movie was released in 1998 its themes can still relate to modern day society because the media constantly goes beyond the boundaries of what is acceptable in broadcasted entertainment with an everincreasing acceptance of explicit and inappropriate humor and criticism,black_comedy
one might wonder how you would view without the knowledge of the twist premise of trumans life it would be impossible to market but it would be an interesting study in deconstructing all the oddities in weirs direction and bizious cinematography their work in creating the world of seahaven is done with excruciating care and detail much like the work of godfigure and showrunner christof thousands of extras and covert cameras a gigantic dome complete with artificial moon and sun 400 life sized buildings props and costumes of all kindsbut biziou also injects a sense of hyper realism into the film the use of high key lighting the scenes slightly overlit create a subtle and controlled sense of artificiality its combined with the voyeuristic photography sneaky povs from behind car dashes and vending machines and cupboards vignetted frames suggesting surveillance the way the edits will bounce from normal compositions to handhelds from the likes of meryls necklace or the neighbours trashcam the almost too pristine and perfect production design of seahavens architecture and sets provides a lived in and yet unnatural world that truman resides inlaura linney is the consummate professional hannah gill who in turn beats out 5 other actresses to land the star role of meryl trumans college sweetheart and eventual wife theres plenty of love and sincerity punctuated briefly by moments of consciousness and recognition linney portrays these moments with such genuineness a nervous glance at the hidden camera at the back of the car as truman goes for maniacal joyride or the nuance of the startled expression and scoff that she quickly struggles to hide when truman confronts her you cant stand methats not true but she quickly re establishes the veneer and takes the opportunity to parade another product for the millions of viewers on several occasions her sweetness is turned up to 11 and the camera quickly and eagerly zooms her satisfaction and a clear view of the product name ed harris christof doesnt seek to hide the nature of his feelings the first extended sequence has him pulling all the strings from a sleek and moody studio in the sky heavily contrasting the cheerful seahaven he expertly guides the broadcast for maximum emotional attachment but is himself distant in the final scenes we are treated to an almost tearful monologue a last plea from the father figure to his son beckoning him to turn back into his loving arms harris plays this part out with such a tender sincerity that its easy to forget his showrunner persona the character of marlon was once given cancer amidst contract disputes in the bathroom or the shower there are no cameras and the sex scenes are only hinted at but ironically christof has no real regard for his sons privacy theres still complexity and depth after several lighting strikes and a violent storm christof witnesses trumans heroics theres our hero shot and relents could be described as satirical but also prophetic in a way after all the international hit big brother only debuted the following year but even that never hit the heights of trumans audience its clearly exaggerated in size and scope but the real question is by how much roger ebert makes a telling point even a decade ago you would not see the likes of celebrity culture focused so intensely on subjects like snooki or honey boo boo these days we have that in materialistic excess entranced by the manufactured stories and plots and the high turnover rate obsessed by every detail of their lives if 20 million can watch the neighbours wedding episode and millions more watch the royal wedding of 2011 how many would tune in to a real life truman special wedding episode especially with someone as accomplished as christof to elicit the maximum emotional connection i really like the role of natascha mcelhone as sylvia as a college extra who falls in love with truman it would have been easy to limit her character as just a unrequited love but she eventually transforms into a protester of sorts frequently calling in and pushing her agenda free truman its such a pinpoint reflection of reality it would be exactly the sort of protest group that would form if a truman show replica existed in our world with the ever raging controversial debates on free will and the ethical and moral implications of such a show the scary thing is that apart from sylvia the world is sparse of this sort of concern the parallel edits of the various fans of the show in different locations cheer and look on with hope and horror as truman attempts his sea escape and they burst into applause when he speaks his famous catchphrase and exits seahavenand then they switch channels and look for another source of entertainment they are like many reality show fans hugely invested in truman as a character but oblivious to his nature as a real human being i wonder how the film would play out with a more serious actor whether weir would forgo some comedic elements and add more drama but then you lose the charm and appeal of carrey in scenes like the beach pizza shop and the mirror astronaut playacting but even then it doesnt matter the illusion is never shattered the audience only care for the final catchphrase linney and the fake makingof documentary reveal a little insight on the character of gill as a child actress who finally hits stardom and is very concerned with the nature of her contract shes managed to negotiate a sizeable payment every time meryl and truman have sex its very easy to focus on that rather than the heartbreaking revelation that truman is faced with at the end of the film,black_comedy
although i have only see the film once i truly do have good to say about the film its an interesting film and its an original idea which of late the pubic has been craving original ideas seeing as most of the films that are in theaters right now are either squeals adaptations or are original ideas but are completely terrible cough cough jupiter ascending cough coughits an amazing film with great characters fantastic writing and a good original idea i could get into full depth of how great this film is but i dont want to spoiler anything for the person that is reading this reviewthis film will most likely stand the test of time i take that back it will stand the test of timejim carrys performance was amazing you can relate to the character unlike another recent terrible original film cough cough jupiter ascending cough coughi would completely recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a good original film,black_comedy
the story is indeed a great example of a thought demanding tale even for now the story still stands as one of the greatest especially for me whats lacking about the movie is that even though it runs at about two ours it doesnt really elaborate much on trumans unsuspecting life the movie immediately sets its conflicts and trumans suspicions as soon as trumans character is introduced nevertheless the movie can really hold on to its grip over the story and exploits all it can from the angles by using the lens filters and roboticsmoved cameras to give the actual spy cam feel the acting overall feels also nice jim carreys acting feels suiting to trumans character and the changes he goes throughlaura linney did her part well enough maintaining that smirk almost all over her screen time noah emmerich did also well by providing the balance needed for trumans dialogs natascha mcelhone and ed harris did nice in completing the needed angles this movie requires,black_comedy
is an extra ordinary movie to say the least it revolves around truman who has no clue that all his actions have been recorded since the day he was born things start to get out of control for the show when truman starts finding out about the reality of his lifejim carrey was just perfect in his role definitely one of his top movies a shame he didnt end up winning an oscar for this movie apart from that i found it very interesting how other actors interacted around truman it feels as he should have got the hints of his life being a tv show much sooner but of course it is just a moviei think that the movie could have been longer and more detailed it was just an awesome film but more plot could have made it way better its sad that they didnt show truman after he left the show but it guess that wasnt possible because they couldnt film him anymore because he was off the set i loved the idea they wanted to create a perfect life for a person where they dont get to get in trouble and can just live peacefully if it wasnt for sylvia truman probably wouldnt have escaped the set ever it almost made me believe by his last line that truman knew all along that it was a show and he is the star of it or did he know thats a question i havent seen explained anywherenonetheless a great watch perfect idea maybe it had some flaws like almost all the movies do but still  something different and interesting that makes you think,black_comedy
1998 dir peter weir  cast jim carrey ed harris laura linney noah emmerich natascha mcelhone sensational film about a life in full view of society it stars jim carrey as truman burbank whose life is an open book for anyone who wishes to watch he is unaware of the hidden cameras that observe his every move since birth anyone who attempts to warn him of his peep hole existence thus sabotaging the show are removed through space satellite program director ed harris has achieved the first fully televised human life everybody is an actor and truman is gradually suspecting that something just isnt right triumphant masterpiece by director peter weir whose credits include dead poets society could weir have predicted the influence his film would hail onto reality television filled with creative camera angles and art direction carrey delivers a sympathetic performance combined with comic wonder and bewilderment he is the ultimate modern hero and champion harris is fantastic as creator crissoff whose genius knows no limits until his creation challenges him laura linney is bizarre as trumans wife who speaks as if in commercials noah emmerich plays his best friend who stocks bending machines natascha mcelhone plays sylvia who attempted to warn truman of the reality of his lifestyle the result is an intriguing parallel of celebrity life score 10  10,black_comedy
a quiet topical observation of society is a deep and thoughtful film the thoughtful premise expanded under peter weirs competent direction and the boundaries of human imagination its simply delightful to watchjim carreys performance is much acclaimed and deservingly so hes charming but he despairs panics and explodes when the only world he knows begins to collapse around him he invites empathy and sympathy when the people closest to him turn out to be completely robotic in their approach in supporting turns ed harris steals every scene as the paternal puppeteering show runner cristof a man with nerves of steel and an almost singleminded focus on his passion project imagine a diabolical version of richard linklater i also think laura linneys performance was hugely underrated  cheerful but out of her depth hysterical and yet the perfect wife of a tv characterthe screenplay is simply perfect at times its a thoughtful observation of christianity with divine intervention by cristof and others its a meaningful reflection on reality television with everyone rooting for and against his trials what it does best though is capture every realistic aspect of such a setting  actors dont know how to respond to spontaneous behaviour actors force product placement on camera outsiders campaign for trumans release its all great right up to the films closing linewhat else is on,black_comedy
is a tv show in a movie starring jim carrey as truman burbank who lives in a utopiatype town where he is unaware that his life is a tv show and those around him are actors within the showthis movie starts off very slow and does not gain any traction until almost toward the middle of the middle where truman begins to realize that there is something wrong with the life he is living in that is where things gain steam and become more exciting as the film progressesjim carreys acting was pretty good as is natascha mcelhone the actress who plays carreys love interest much of the other cast members acted too carefree and theatrical which rendered them somewhat annoying it was also distressing to see all of the characters in on this conspiracy of exploiting trumans life in worldwide broadcasted tv show making you root for truman to outsmart the conspirators and escape the fake life they have envisioned for himthis movie sends a message that life is not simple and there is no such thing as a perfect world despite all the problems and turmoil in the world there is nothing greater than your own freedom to live your life and make your own choicesagain the movie takes quite a long while to gain any momentum and burkhard von dallwitzs music score for the film seemed very out of place for the story however the overall plot is quite captivating making the movie worth the watchgrade b,black_comedy
how this movie is shot is so interesting there are many first person shots and just the angles throughout the film are different compared to a normal film weir did a good job on giving a well mixture between comedy and suspensedrama there were moments that made me laugh and moments that kept really engaged with what was happening to truman thats also just good writing so kudos to andrew niccolthe costume design and set is very interesting the costumes give the set of the city a vintage era but its the 90s obviously also just the set in general imagine the set of edward scissorhands but not as creepy also the music is fantastic its not original but it is an enjoyable sound for your earsits a movie that i finally got to see and it made me happy truman show is a film that will not disappoint audiences with its great editing music acting and everything else overall only grouch is that i wish there was a bit more to the ending five more minutes would have been great despite that truman show is a film i definitely plan on seeing again and again,black_comedy
jim carrey plays it straight in and is superb plot in a paragraph truman burbank a brilliant jim carrey an advertising salesman is totally unaware that his entire life is staged for a tv showed harris was rightly nominated for an oscar for his work here but how could the academy ignore jim carrey here he is fantastic playing it straight and totally against type carrey shines and gives a performance with an amazing amount of heart laura linney does well as meryl trumans wife while natasha mcelhone is a joy as laurensylvia and holland taylor is her usual brilliant self phillip baker hall offers solid support as does pretty much all the cast this movie is unfairly compared to edtv while both deal with a man on tv 24 hours a day they are totally different concepts and movies and should not be compared to each other,black_comedy
watching this fantastic movie was no chore this movie severely screwed with peoples head including mine it made everyone ask is that possible could i be in a tv show this hysteria was even given the name of the truman syndrome now think about it readers a movie so realistic and well written that it could give even one person the thought that they could be in a movietv show i know after watching it i had my doubts i still do but dont tell the directors although i would not consider this one of jim carrys best movies i think he did a good job giving his character the emotions needed to give this movie life he steered away from his normal antics and over all goofballery i know that is not a word even with a few carryism he still pulled it off,black_comedy
you are pulled very closely towards the main character and get on the adventure of him exploring the possibility that there is more to life then island where hes been stuck on and monitored for a reality tv showit is moving jim c plays the character very well and gives you a comfort feeling while watching the movie the endfelt flimsy until it actually ends there it gave me perfect closure even when it ends openthe overall atmosphere of the movie feels exciting you get pulled into the story while truman searches for answers of where his father went or if this is all real in search of his lost lovethe scenery really feels charming the early 60s or is that 70s in my opinion the director in the movie feels bad acted but that is just meoverall this movie is a feel good movie rainy day watch it ,black_comedy
an insurance salesmanadjuster jim carrey discovers his entire life is actually a tv showthis movie has been brought to ethics and philosophy classes and used as a tool for discussion unfortunately it was never used in any class i took despite being a philosophy major but i guess we cannot all get that experienceso much to ponder was it right to treat truman this way was the television executive playing god if the wife laura linney was only in it as part of a contract and not because she genuinely cared for truman what does that make her and what if this really happened would people watch it or rebel,black_comedy
truman burbank jim carrey lives an ordinary life as an insurance man in an idyllic seaside town seahaven he would love to go to fiji but he is trap on the island by a fear stemming from a childhood trauma it turns out his whole life is manufactured by tv artist christof ed harris is the most popular tvseries in the world his wife meryl is played by actress hannah gill laura linney his best friend marlon noah emmerich along with everybody in the town as well as the town itself is completely fake even his childhood trauma was manufactured questionable things keep happening sylvia natascha mcelhone who played his dreamgirl lauren tries to help him escapeon one level this is a profound drama about the tv world and modern life on another level this is a great character and jim carrey carries it off beautifully it is both funny and thoughtprovoking its probably looked back on as a signpost for the 90s this is a movie that is completely original and compelling,black_comedy
this was an incredible heartbreaking yet uplifting story of a man who discovers that his entire existence is manufactured jim carrey gives a powerful performance as the titular character whose wideeyed optimism and sense of humor make it nearly impossible not to root for him we as the viewers are treated to three different perspectives trumans world christofs world and the rest of the world who have been watching trumans life unfold since the day he was born beyond the creepy suburbanesque world that christof created for him is the real world where billions of people watch him day in and day out one thing that movie does extremely well although i dont think it was the first is how eerily prescient it is in predicting the nature of reality tv and its effect on our culture it also explores themes such as the nature of reality its just an incredible film all around and should be seen by everyone,black_comedy
i watched this movie because i went to florida at seaside and people asked me if i saw who was filmed there now i wish i had seen it before  its a really good movie the tension increases slowly and you feel sad for truman its not a simple comedy it has a profound meaning it criticizes the reality show it was released in 1998 but its still modern unfortunately after watching this film you will never look at reality show the same way  anyway i recommend it love it  after watching this film you will never look at reality show the same way  anyway i recommend it love it  i like it i like it i like it i like it,black_comedy
the concept of someones entire life being turned into reality television seems remarkably prescient given the boom in reality tv that has happened since the plot line of this movie which follows jim carreys attempts to a understand some of the oddities about his world and b escape from it altogether could never really fail and it doesnt disappoint its a really enjoyable watchi cant help feeling however that in the hands of a better director and as much as i love jim carrey with a different lead actor this movie could have been even better it has all the markings of a scifi dystopian classic but never realises its potential preferring to remain primarily a quirky american comedy drama,black_comedy
i am not hater of this movie but some of the songs where bit bad in it i am not saying its not an awful movie but being that some of the songs where bit bad there some good songs in it ok about the story its about guy who has beem taken care of some actors in this and he does not know its real and many people try to get in his way to stop him getting into other places as well he trys to get out but fails he trys one more time to get out because in his teenage hold he find someone that he really loves and they took her way from him which is the fact he want to get out and find his true love that was the fact that made this movie really good not to bad not to stupid i love the boat scene where he trys to get out which really good but and thats how movie should be i know that some people disagree about this but i dont disagree about hating this movie its pretty good but some of songs where bit bad and some good but its great for all ages but great movie its show how we feel inside great movie 7 out of 10 pretty good,black_comedy
i liked the film because jim carrey was in ithe is a good actor nd very funnyhe is truman in the the main character in the filmthe film is about trumanwho has been filmed for 10909 days of his life by 5000 cameras in a huge movie sethe think its all real until one day he suspects something and doesnt stop he thinks theres something fishy going onsome ideas the directors wanted to get across were you have to be determined to do something that you want to do not just do it and think it will all work out but it wontthis film is a lot more serous than jim carrys other films like the mask and a little similar to the eternal sunshine of the spotless mind,black_comedy
truman jim cerry is a person who is always happy and wants to explore every time he tries to leave there is always something stopping him for example he tries to drive out of town and the roads are filled with trafficthis movie is better than other jim cerry movies such as the mask  series of unfortunate events in the end of he gets to leave the islandmy favorite part of the movie is when truman talks to silvier i thought this movie was great because it caught my attention and made me wounder what his life would be like in the real worldi think the directer wanted you to think what if my world is fake,black_comedy
the film is based around the character truman burbankplayed by jim carrey his life was filmed all day every day the world and everything in it was made for him and he starts to notice itthe director peter weir did a great job on this film it was as if you were looking into trumans world he also showed us what he thought a perfect world was the style was like it was in the fiftiesi really enjoyed this film because it was a very original story jim carrey played truman burbank really well his role was believable if you liked this film then you would like eternal sunshine of the spotless mind,black_comedy
truman burbankjim carry is the star of the famous reality program broadcasted live 24 hours a day all over the worldhe lives in his own little town designed by the creator of the program christof this townlarge movie set was made as a good example of christofs idea of the perfect world would be everyone in the town of seahaven is an actor except for truman himself and their job is to act like everyday townfolk and keep him away from the possible showbreaking truth the closest people to him are his wife meryllaura linney and his best friend marlonnoah emmerich one day an exshow member sylvianatascha mcelhone appeared and tries to tell him that its all fake none of its real its all a show etc so his wife and friend marlon have to convince him otherwise but he got curious and tries to escape and the creator tries to stop him but he insists on being free jim carrys character is a little calmer and less crazy compared to movies such as ace ventura for example but makes up for it in other ways this is a really good movie written by andrew niccol and directed by peter weir,black_comedy
i thought this movie was about a 7 out of 10 i didnt like most of the characters except for truman and his friend marlonthe main characters are truman jim carrey his wife meryl laura linney his friend marlon noah emmerich and the creator of the show christofthe movie was about truman being in a show that broadcasts 247 all around the world without him knowing about iti think the director wanted to say that not everything is what it seems likeif you liked napolean dynamite you may like they both have the same kind of jokes and stuff,black_comedy
is a film about truman jim carrey he is one real man living among a town sea haven with a last cast of actors  during the film truman starts to realize that everything is too perfect and it all seams to be made up around himi enjoyed watching this film and rated it seven and a half out of ten a few things i disliked were when the actors were advertising products they over did it giving it away to truman that they were talking to someone else i think that the director wanted to show what a perfect world would be like and what it would drive people to do i think that he successful in doing this compared to other jim carrey films he was not as crazy but he still made random dictions and he was very determined to do what he felt he needed to do,black_comedy
was a exciting and strange film it was a mixture of comedy and reality but what i liked most about the film was how it all unrolled till the endjim carrey was a great actor in this film he brought his character to life and made me think that he was confused and lost but yet some how he knows what is going onthe plot of the show was an original one a mere child born on a reality tv show and filmed all his life every day went basically the same until there was muck ups which later on where covered upone of the ideas i thought that the director was trying to show was that even in a fake world created by people it still has the same values lies and every think that people do or dont want in life are in the real world is well by vedsta,black_comedy
can you imagine crying at a jim carrey movie if you plan to see this movie you dont have to imagine it will become reality an ordinary man named truman jim carrey lives with his wifelaura linneygoes to work everyday the usual but his world gets turned upside down when he find that his life is a popular tv show created by ed harristhis movie only has one word to describe it underscribleits so original and jim carrey gives it his all ine of the best performances in his entire career this movie has an amazing storyline scenery and ensembleafter the movie ends youre sad cause it ended but you cant help to smile knowing that truman had an happy ending truly is one of the best ive ever seen,black_comedy
in an age in motion pictures where heists explosions action set pieces love stories and comic book adaptations dominate the silver screen its remarkable to come across a picture as fresh as original and as alltogether fascinating as director peter weirs part drama part comedy part social commentary on the nature of television and ones right to privacy and a normal lifetruman burbank jim carrey is an ordinary man good natured and kind to all who lives a sweet life of bliss in seahaven where he works for an insurance company he has a nice place good neighbours and a loving wife laura linney but what he doesnt have is any knowledge that everybody hes ever known is an actor that those he doesnt know are extras and that seahaven is a concealed dome a giant stage in los angeles he has no idea and that every second of every day of his life has been recorded by over 5000 carefully placed cameras and broadcast to the entire world hes the star of the first unwanted child legally adopted by a corporation when a figure from his traumatic past revisits him on the streets of seahaven truman begins to notice a series of strange occurrences that offer clues of his actual existence i suppose its an inevitability that truman will eventually discover the truth its not the films best kept secret but the way in which it all occurs to him is certainly more than half the funin all his films jim carrey has never put in a performance so composed and articulate as he does in  possessing just the right amounts of humour and innocence necessary for truman burbank in some ways hes even funnier than he can be with any number of the overthetop faces he has in his comedic arsenal ed harris as the shows creator and director christof has a small role but delivers well and the scene where he and truman finally speak like man and god is terrifictheres nothing flashy in the production of weirs documentarystyle approach to bar a few wellcomposed shots from various hidden cameras in seahaven what he achieves is effective though in the way he proposes that what society can be so engrossed in  of all things  is an ordinary man living an ordinary life that we are willing to accept the complete sacrifice even if not in a literal sense of a mans entire life for the sake of entertainment its what makes ultimately so interesting for the audience who watch it as beings even higher than christof its so captivating that i felt a little dissatisfied at the end of the picture having wanted more of truman more of behind thescenes more of the same monotony if it werent for the story feeling a little too rushed before it was all over could have been even more deep felt and enjoyable than it was but that being said it is an excellent and highly original motion picture,black_comedy
have you ever thought that may be your life was a reality show watched by millions of people and that everyone around you was just hired actors well takes that idea and runs with it in this dramacomedy staring jim carey as truman burbank the man known around the world i found this movie extremely pleasing considering i did not go in with high expectations i was never a big fan of jim carreys comedy before this but i really did find this movie quite enjoyable definitely suggest watching a fun movie that is not too long but keeps you into it never really gets dry at all throughout the whole movie and has some hysterical moments,black_comedy
one of my favorites just an excellent thought provoking movie with some flaws but still goodone of the first movies where jim carrey proves he can act very well most of the cast is good highlights include ed harris as creator and laura linney as trumans wife visually stunning and very very very fun to watch its a good thing peter weir directed it because something like this takes a lot of creativity it was also shot very well and the cameras barely move the movie has some other flaws but is still a masterpiece it doesnt matter what kind of movies you like this one is fun to watch for everybody watch ittwo thumbs up,black_comedy
6553265532trumans dadmy topic   1 cassie sharpe 84chistoffs view of his created world is that it is well to him perfect to others it would seem to be cruel sick unkind corrupted and unusual to have a person trapped in a world that is not real i feel that it is a very strange thing to do to another living human being every thing truman does the studio is prepared for they know how to deal with him and his sudden actions there are thousands of actors with one little ear piece but there is one specifically trumans best friend since kindergarten and the one truman trusts the most is marlon but marlon is also the one who has to lie the most even though he doesnt want to he does one of the most ironic quotes from the movie was said by marlon as he talked to truman this is what he said  truman the last thing i would ever do is lie to you as i look at all of the personal and public things truman has said or done i disagree with christoffs view of the worldin the dome that trumans life is taking place truman is the only thing that is real in the dome there are more than 4999 big and small cameras which are placed all over the little town with lights and speakers it is a little scary that everywhere you go someone is always watching you at the beginning of the movie one of the lights fall from the very top of the dome so far up you cant even see it of course on the radio the next day they announce a plane was losing parts while flying through the air lucky for the studio and christoff truman believes it as for me i would become suspiciouschristoff working as the main producer is a very smart guy he really knows how to make a really good show a very thoughtful quote from christoff was we accept the reality of the world with which we are presented meaning every problem every speed bump we hit we will over come because we can deal with what we know we can handle i think that this statement is a very true one because if you are really set to some thing you can overcome any obstacles because this is what you really want this quote is a very smart quote from a very unusual man a monster some would say some like many others too i think he is an awful man and lauren thinks so toolauren is a female actor which truman meets at school and talks to in the library lauren tells truman she is not allowed to talk to him truman replies with a cheesy answer yeah well i can understand that im a pretty dangerous character lauren is determined to tell truman the truth about his life as lauren takes truman to the beach to tell him the truth she begins to tell him that they are coming for her so they need to talk fast she also tells him her real name is sylvia and that she is an actor and so is every one else and that his life is real but his reality isnt for me i agree with laurensylvia if i were in her shoes i would tell truman as well a car comes rolling in her father jumps out and tells truman they are moving to fiji as truman grows older he becomes determined to move to fijitruman as determined as he is goes to a travel agent to book a flight to fiji he sees tons of warnings and safety precautions of why not to fly on airplanes they say we can book a flight for you in july next year fiji is very popular truman decides he wants to sail there himself truman is terrified of water ever since he was a little boy because the studio made his father diedrown in the water christoff being so smart made it so he would never sail away i feel that it was a very smart move but still it was really mean to kill off some one who is so important to a child but truman is seriously determined to get out of his small town once every one is asleep truman sneaks away he tries to sail away christoff has a determination for himself not to let truman escape he thinks up a storm literally the storm is so huge he almost kills truman an associate says you cant kill him in front of a live audience christoff replies with a smart but true answer he was born in front of a live audience why cant they be part of the end as truman recuperates from the storm he runs into a gigantic wall with his boat there are stairs truman leaves and successfully got a real life i believe that christoffs view of the world was wrong it must be scary to always be watched by someone you dont even know or maybe its fun to always be the center of attention i believe that you can do anything that you set your mind to truman worked hard to find out the truth once he knew something was wrong this is a good way to be in the end i think that it is a good way to live your life you need to be persistent and truthful and go with what you know is right,black_comedy
you left ed harris out of the credits despite the fact that he plays a key role christof creator of fictional truman show and received an oscar nomination for his acting in the film harris is of course a fine actor who was also nominated twice before for roles in pollock he played the title character and apollo 13 as creator of essentially trumans life in the film writer of the generalized story line given to actors director and supervisor of all else relating to the television production he is a kind of father to the truman character 16 of 6 pages with references to multiple selves inside this book return to book 1 on page 16 argument is the proposal that social saturation brings with it a general loss in our assumption of true and knowable selves as we absorb multiple voices we find that each truth is relative to our simultaneous consciousness of compelling alternatives we come to be aware  2 on page 71 dismay the drama has so often been played out on television and movie screens that one is already prepared with multiple options if one wins a wonderful prize suffers a humiliating  to put it more broadly as the century has progressed selves have become increasingly populated with the character of others 3 we are not one or a few but like walt  3 on page 72 i am not doing so well in closely related work the psychologists hazel markus and paula nurius speak of possible selves the multiple conceptions people harbor of what they might become would like to become or are afraid to become  in each  4 on page 150 playing a role the sense of self as strategic manipulator derives then from the modernist context in which real authentic selves existedor should existand to act in any other way was  sense of superficiality the guilt at not measuring up to multiple criteriagive way to an optimistic sense of enormous possibility the world of friendship and social efficacy is constantly expanding and  5 on page 157 objects and with his image is played out we no longer exist as playwrights or actors but as terminals of multiple networks 21 it would be foolish to propose that a consciousness of relational selves is widely shared in western culture however in many ways one senses its presence in everyday affairs it is there  6 on page 249 aspects of the self personal identity cannot seem to be fixed    the person experiences himself as many selves each of which is felt to have     such an orientation as vastly liberating in this sensitivity to multiple forms of spirituality he sees the possibility for a person to move meaningfully through a pluralistic universe  by contrast  return to book,black_comedy
i only came across this film around 2004 so i am well behind the times but was extremely impressedreally at a loss for wordsbut there was a point in the film that reminded me of an idea that was going the rounds when i was at university and people were smoking pot and dreaming of changing the world via counterculturein fact 2 ideas came back2 pictures i remember that seem to have cropped up in the film to opposite effect  the first chronologically later was in the french film lan 01 which was based on the idea of a sudden change of perspective and life reality that would supposedly take effect when people all around would suddenly just get it and everything would start from scratch from year one so to speakby the way this film occurred around the time of the events in cambodia and i sometimes wonder whether old pol pot was a fan of it as there were a lot of those bastards in paris ho chi mingkhomeini etc anyway the other thing i remember was a cartoon in a counterculture magazine and the idea was that the character would be living in the mundane regulated monochrome environment of society when he would suddenly make a contact with a fellow human being and hey presto they would notice a little crack appear in the wallof course on closer inspection it is revealed that they can look through the crack and even go through it on the other side of the crack the cartoonist has painted in the alternative view of the world lots of cows i seem to recall and riversmaybe you get the picture so when i see the bowsprit of careys boat pierce the edge of the ocean sky it reminds me of that image but in an opposite kind of a way its back to reality and not some kind of a pipe dream,black_comedy
has come at a time when cloning and identity theft are subjects which are so often raised it is now that these subjects penetrate our every day lives involving usnot just fictional characters in movies there have been many attempts by multinational corporations to register a life form as intellectual property so they can do what they please with what is their property and so the cloning world has begun this would allow a child to be genetically altered for medical reasons to avoid spinabifida or another ailment and in the process be registered as the corporations intellectual property they can then use that child throughout its life to harvest blood or tissue without any legal limitations all pieinthesky stuff but this has been an issue discussed by governments and pharmaceutical corporations all around the world for over a decade i loved for its humour and skillful use of presentday technology it was a late night viewing choice of this movie on tv or our latest version of big brother on another channel here in britain which made me realise how prescient this movie had been in 1998 the other coincidence is that of a book written years ago about a woman who was diagnosed as schizophrenic and had delusions that her whole life had been run by people called operators and she was just theirthing to be tested and manipulated for their amusement and curiosity they revealed to her that operators had been around since the dawn of man and had constantly set tasks for their things which inadvertently caused man to evolve they said if it hadnt been for us you humans would still be bumping into each other in caves her life was a series of struggles to break free from this observing and testing by the operators christof could slip straight into the guise of operator in for it was his setting of tasks and emotional tests that caused truman to grow and mature in the way he did a great movie on many levels but a good piece of entertainment too hollywood doing it the way it should,black_comedy
whats great about this film is that although ostensibly its about societys obsession with tv and voyeurism the influences appear to be things like 1984 the prisoner and even mans attempt at spirituality theres a little bit of truman in all of us  seriously how much freedom do we really have dont you ever feel like you have no control and wonder if there is someone out there plotting your destiny a clever film indeed if only because it raises issues and encourages us to ask questions also beautifully played  for the most part straight  by carrey natascha mcelhone is wonderful if underused harris is surprisingly good as the selfappointed creator of what exactly  in his mind original inspiring warm and funny the very last line of the film is perhaps the most telling of all,black_comedy
my friends and i agree that this film is underrated to many it came out roughly in the same time as edtv so there are comparisons made however as in eternal sunshine of the spotless mind carrey demonstrates his skills as an actor a straight actor and to be honest i prefer carrey in truman show and esotsm and even man in the moon to his comic performances a funny man he is but unlike say bill murray a fave of mine nonetheless carrey can make the change from funny to straight easily watch this film and question life itself like the prisoner and other such things it can throw up some questions the whole big brother angle on life and whathaveyou but mostly just watch this for a drastically underrated performance by carrey,black_comedy
is a great movie that shows the faults in reality tv it satarizes how ridiclious reality tv is and how people are paying to much attention to it by having a show that revolves around one persons life it shows how people will watch anything his whole life is a fraud and he does not know this by showing in the movie the director clearly satarizes reality tv and shows how bad it is i felt this was a very entertaining movie it shows how truman grew as a person and found the courage to search for more and to reach his dreams he wanted to leave and go off to fiji but there was always something stopping him when he finally found out the truth and got out of the show he realized his dream and found more to life,black_comedy
i believe that there are four main satires during this movie they are the following reality televisionthe american dream sense of safety for a person and consumerismthe reality television comes into play with the whole television in which it is a show that people think is real but in reality it was all fake reality shows are also addicting and as they show in the movie they make fun of the people who are so in love with the show that they always have it on since it is a show that just keeps going on and on the american dream is shown in that trumans wife is pretending to be the perfect wife and be all old fashioned the sense of safety is shown in that the town no one is able to leave and they live in this small area the reason is for truman to not get hurt but you have to learn from your mistakes lastly the consumerism is shown throughout the movie in weird places and that is making fun of how much america uses that in television shows and movie so now that i have stated my opinion what is yours,black_comedy
jim carrey does an immaculate job of actually playing a serious role the problem is that jim has played so many comedies that a semisweet role isnt really approved by the common public in my opinion he is still very funny and plays truman very well the question for isnt did jim carrey play his role well or not rather it be is the satire to this film too realistic to how american minds think the director peter weir does a very good job making fun of us he shows through comedy triumph and weakness how to advertise the way that weir makes fun of reality tv makes all americans look like cruel idiots the truman network that people watch almost 247 is pop culture at its weakest this is saying right there that we are sort of interdependent to it also it proves foreign countries opinion that americans are lazy by showing people of all ages watching overall jim carrey and the rest of the cast does an amazing job of portraying the fairytale life of truman,black_comedy
the concept of this film is genius truman is the star of his own series and he doesnt know it a wonder that hollywood finally managed to create an intelligent funny emotional esoterical mysterious philosophicalin short an all covering film that is really touching in the first somewhat overlong half the story is following the main hero truman through his point of view and elaborating his quiet normal life while the director peter weir is cleverly choosing strange camera angles to give the feeling as if he is being spyed by someone in the second and much more intriguing part the story shifts to the outside world and to christofs 10 mile wide studio from which truman is being monitored by 5000 cameras 24 hours a day for a tv show the themes of this scifi tragicomedy are quite fascinating existential  finding out who we are and stopping anyone who wants to control our life  philosophical  what is real and what not  and even subversive  the media changed the world so much that even a lie can pass as truth  one of the best scenes is the one where christof touches the sleeping truman on the screen at night creating a strange feeling how he is present in his life although he never met himdeservedly won 3 golden globes for best score main actor jim carrey and supporting actor ed harris who was also nominated for an oscarstill as much as i love it i have to admit that the original shooting script by andrew niccol overshadows it there we had a much more intimate storyline and original ideas some of the highlights there were that the location was new york  the scene where truman accidentally discovers the word trumanesque in the dictionary the building of the fake town sydney chloes marching in into christofs room and telling him that truman didnt masturbate for 2 months the dialog between a caller and christof  i enjoyed your work christof but i cant say i saw all of it  who can  or when truman disguised himself while entering an xxx store all the while some two viewers had an ironic dialog  whats with the disguise  maybe he doesnt want to be recognized  i cant understand why those scenes were deleted true the script ending is much weaker than the movie ending but all in all it gives an better impression  and elaborates the plot more its sad because with that script this could have easily been even bettergrade 910,black_comedy
thats all i can say after watching this movie i just finished it not five minutes ago and the things i am feeling are beyond description by the end i was sitting enraptured on my couch staring unblinkingly at the events happening on my screen i began to feel so insignificant so small like my life was equivalent to that of a housefly it felt so strangethis was definitely definitely a 1010 film pure wonder on all counts in fact im beginning to wonder why im writing this review as it seems unlikely that ill meet the tenline minimum there is simply nothing i can say except for amazing amazing amazingi cant even begin to imagine the moment of reality the moment when you realise that your entire life has been scripted has been surrounding you the moment when you realise that your life is nothing but a thing of entertainment there is no originality everything is planned it must feel so unbelievable unthinkable incredible inconceivable these are only a few of the adjectives there are to describe that mindboggling feelingif you havent seen this film i absolutely and completely urge you to do so your life as you know it will change forever,black_comedy
i first saw the movie when i was really small i think that it was 1999  one year after it appeared and my father took me to this unknown cinema and didnt tell me what i was about to see i was absolutely fascinated by the story at that time the plot itself is interesting and intelligent after a while i saw the same movie again and i figured out the hidden meanings and the real beauty in trumans story and i was indeed surprised actually trumans story is no different from our story he was the essential piece in a big plan but didnt know it because he had no eyes for it he was closed inside a little incomplete world and could not escape finally truman is your average man who suddenly realizes that there may be more to world than he is able to see,black_comedy
amazing film one of the best of my life it opened my conscious to the concept of programmed world that even i am a part of all is so clear and easy now jim carey is excellent in the film the 2nd last scene where his boat dashes with the boundaries of studio and then he cries vow that was too good by jim hats off to peter weir the concept of fear which with this world is controlled has been brought beautifully with a subjective pov i think that was simply too good again the concept of creator or metaphoric to god was impressivei think similar stage comes in everyones life where one feels that all this world is false and our existence doesnt matter to all out there someway or other they are hear to earn thatper day from us i hope like the film even we all get that exit door very soonyou never had camera in my head  that line was simply vow,black_comedy
i personally like carrey if simply for the reason that ive not seen any of his more off the wall stuff my experience with him has been the mask bruce almighty and the majestic is an astute commentary on our lives funny how we go through them as the director stated accepting the reality that is presented to us could it then be that what we know and see isnt really what is at all from the heavens many of us know of a god that watches over us loving us unconditionally on the pretense and within the world that he has created for us he believes with all his heart that it is the best for us yet what if what if it is not the best what if we do not want what we are given what if we long for something else something inexplicable that we can not even put in to words it seems that questions are the very life blood that pumps through us that and an unconquerable spirit to have ever more than we know is that why poets write explorers leave and dreamers find another reality perhaps as we contemplate our own little worlds we will pause now and again to question what we see and what we believe we know and maybe just maybe we will learn in bruce almighty i asked my son what he had learned he answered with that we dont know everything i thought that was a pretty astute observation from a 13 year old who usually believes he does he also commented on how it was best to think about why we want something not bad for a couple tenspots ms  chantaclaircomchristof we accept the reality of the world with which we are presented,black_comedy
i truly believe this is the citizen kane of our time from the first reel to the last it intrigues us pulls us in makes us cry and truly makes us question the world around us the metaphoric meaning of truman fairbanks is phenomenal as are all of the performances in it although it was mainly recognized for jim carreys first dramatic venture the movie itself is so much more and he perfectly fits into his role in what is truly an ensemble piece carrey has an amazing ability to relate to his audience especially for one whos comic movies are incredibly over the top he reminds of a young jimmy stuart in how amazingly likable he always is not surprisingly stuart is one of jim carreys idolsa final testament to this movies greatness is the stir it created at the oscars after jim carrey had won the golden globe for best actor he was not even nominated for the oscar similarly a movie many critics thought was the finest of the year was not even nominated for best picture in an rare show of defiance the directors nominated wier for best director despite the movie not making the listif youve never seen this movie do so you will not regret it,black_comedy
my cousin asked me if i wanted to watch or malcolm x i thought about it malcolm x was certainly a great person i didnt know anything about the movie on that day i wanted to watch something funny no serious stuffi asked my cousin who was in he told me jim carrey and before he could go on i stopped him and said i want to watch this one i thought itd be hilarious like any other jim carrey movie but boy was i in for a ridethe movie started out well somewhat confusing some people started talking about i stopped worrying what that meant and i guessed the plot within the first hour of the movie fantastic idea for a moviejim carrey did a brilliant job one of his best semiserious movies peter weirs direction was stunning i also liked ed harris good job to the rest of the castthis movie is superb it is a must watch for everyone,black_comedy
i remember when this movie first came out in the theater and i had a chance to catch it back then it was considered a vast departure for jim carrey seeing as hes only been in comedies such as the ace ventura movies in retrospect was only a harbinger of the kind of acting he could do but it wasnt his movie alone andrew niccols script and peter weirs direction and the rest of the cast that make this movie work on so many levelsone level in which along with its counterpart ed tv works is that both movies predate the whole reality tv craze by a good 2 or 3 years oh we had the real world but that was the extent of itthis was before mtv was milking its incarnations for all its worth and definitely before survivor the simple life and those celebreality shows on vh1 the scenes in which people react to the things truman does and hang on his every movement is no different than how people tune in for the next episode of survivor waiting on who will be voted off the island another theme that is evident in the movie is the desire for absolute control as shown in the character of christof he has structured trumans world as to who could or couldnt talk to him using any means necessary to keep him on the island and ultimately losing while it seems that christof has a connection to truman he is merely a means to an end which is a televised life from cradle to graveone thing that i need to point out again is jim carreys acting is his first serious role departing from the sightgag movies of his earlier career his acting is so reserved and yet there are funny moments of his but it doesnt break from the tone of the movie or his overall character everyone was caught by surprise in this apparent 180 especially film critic duo gene siskel and roger ebert they were so impressed by carrey that they publicly apologized to him for panning ace ventura pet detective overall this movie i like to fall under the category one of the best films ever made on my hierarchy of movies i would put this under worth full priceadd this to your dvd collection grade a,black_comedy
take the director of a classic like picnic at hanging rock or gallipolli and add someone best know for his wacky rubberised facial characters and you could have a very uncomfortable recipe for disaster in fact peter weirs direction and the inspired casting of jim carrey alongside people like ed harris brought a pathostinged magic to the screen thats rarely been seen since the likes of james stewart if youve not seen it then i urge you to do do and if you have then get it down off the shelf and watch it again now better still show it to someone you care about now in all honesty that was all i wanted to say but this website has said i havent met the minimum criteria of 10 lines so im now just waffling until i can get my copy down off the shelf and start watching it,black_comedy
this 2005 is only the second time i have seen this film since it was released it holds up really well but todays viewer must realize that this was made before reality tv the perception at the time of the making of this film 1998 is that people would hate to have cameras record their every waking and sleeping moment how wrong that has turned out to be now my question is why isnt ed harris name in the credits he played christof and even won a supporting best actor award at the academy of science fiction yet his name is missing from the creditsone casting question why did they choose three actresses to play his love interest who all had the same blonde streaked hair style,black_comedy
was an intelligent and stylish social commentary about lost hopes and dreams as well as the effect the media has on us writer andrew nicol and director peter weir take us into the extraordinary world of truman burbank a sheltered young man with an alleged perfect life whose life as it is slowly revealed to the viewer is a 247 television show directed by a godlike dictator ed harriswho has televised and controlled trumanlife from birth and is determined to hold onto truman even after he has caught onto what is happening the thing i love about this story is the way it unfolds slowlythe story is told at a leisurely pace and we are only thrown subtle clues at first theres a wonderful moment where truman is walking down the street and is almost brained on the head by a spotlight the expression on trumans face at seeing a spotlight fall from the sky is just priceless and we are scratching our heads the same way truman is once truman realizes what is going on he wants nothing to do with it and attempts to escape whether or not truman escapes is unimportant what is important is watching truman trying to figure out what is going on jim carrey redefined his career completely with this completely captivating performance in the title role carrey proved that he knew how to do more than pratfalls and mugging with this thoughtful and riveting performance and it was outrageous that carrey was not nominated for an academy award i dont know about winning but he at least deserved a nomination ed harris as cristof the director of trumans show gives the performance of his career that should have won him the oscar he was nominated but was robbed a wonderful film that is worth seeing if for no other reason than to marvel at the amazing performances of carrey and harris,black_comedy
is refreshingly creative and has a unique plot jim carrey gives one of his best performances as he acts more serious than usual i am not a fan of other carrey movies and do not appreciate his sense of humor the way most people do but that aside i loved him in this movie parts of give you chills up the side and you really get a feel for the characters involved the scope of scenery and the dome the movie is shot in is magnificent the movie is also logical in its design and one gets the feeling that this could really happen i would describe this movies genre as a light drama that has comedy but not slapstick humor one of my favorite movies of all time,black_comedy
has received quite a lot of praise since its release in 1998 but its never really managed to achieve the status that it rightly deserves what we have here is a film that more than delivers on the entertainment front while still finding time for a backbone of thoughtprovoking substance more often than not with movies that work from a premise rather than an actual plot they miss the mark because of a lack of ideas to populate the premise with but that certainly isnt the case here the film follows the story of truman burbank truman is an insurance salesman but unlike most insurance salesmen he has his own show and unlike most people with their own showhe doesnt know about it truman burbank is the unwitting star of the massively successful tv show his whole life has been the subject of this show and everything that he believes to be real is actually the brainchild of the shows creator the flamboyant christof we then follow truman as he goes about finding out that the real world and his world are different places entirelyas you might expect this plot gives the film great basis for thoughtprovoking ideas the idea itself of having a tv show filmed around your life is intriguing to say the least and is more than enough to inspire paranoia from more than a few audience members the idea is fused with the drama surrounding trumans life and the two blend brilliantly adding to this is the way that the film gives a commentary on the waive of reality tv shows the substance is more than evident as we are shown that truman is a prisoner within his own life and the tv crew are in effect god features what is probably jim careys best performance the way that he amiably portrays the character makes the film a delight to watch carey was of course more known for his over the top and very good comedy roles before this film but here he really shows his worth as an actor the rest of the cast is mainly made up of lesserknown stars with ed harris standing out and the rest helping to build the film into a great ensemble drama before this film peter weir was known for making okgood films such as dead poets society and witness but this film is his masterpiece,black_comedy
truman burbank leads an every day sort of life he and his wife merril live in beautiful idyllic seahaven island where she is a nurse and he is an insurance broker but its actually all part of a large tv show everyone but truman is an actor and the city and buildings are all sets truman was born on live tv and his every moment is carried live to millions then after a few glitches he starts to suspect that he is being watched simply put a masterpiece who hasnt at some time felt that we were being watched paranoid or are we on tv jim carreys performance of truman still ranks among his best and that covers a lot of ground even people who arent carrey fans agree that his truman burbank is a fantastic piece of work its also fun seeing the goofs that are posted at imdb and elsewhere how can they be goofstheyre all scripted into a tv show what a work of genius the story of a man whose every moment of life was broadcast to millions in a way it was predictive of the future today seven years later with the multitudes of reality tv shows this originalreality show is even better than when i first saw it time has actually raised it from a work of art to a masterpiece,black_comedy
 thoughtprovoking touching intellectual story formed into a memorable motion picture its unique craftsmanship takes on a new dimension in movie entertainment jim carrey is truman burbank an assurance salesman who lives inside of a world that seems questionable as the story unfolds several strange occurrences leads truman to question the normality or lack thereof of his life he believed once made sense this wonder intensifies as the film continues to follow trumans adventurous search for the answer the truth the meaning of his life little did truman know that his entire life was secretly filmed and watched hour by hour and day to day by an engrossed world this is a motion picture that especially showcases peter weirs ability as a director jim carrey gives an eminently exceptional performance in the leading role the films frequent transition from clever comedy to inspiring drama is pulled off without affecting the excellence of its originality,black_comedy
wow this movie is great i love the end this is an excellent movie with a very original plot line one of jim carreys best filmstruman thinks he lives a normal life but discovers that his entire life has just been a tv show nothing is real he starts to discover all sorts of different things that are notnormal he begins to wonder why his wife describes different food products in detail and how they are better than othersi am not going to say much more except that this is a must see movie and in case i dont see yagood afternoon good evening and goodnight,black_comedy
 a true mans realityits an excellent interpretation of demigod  human relationship although a poor mans representation  but surely a pretty good oneever since the infant jim was in the womb  the directordemi god  with the help of scientific advancement  technology took the entire growth process delivery childhood adulthood marriagebasically outlined the life cycle of the child born the human director was trying to act god in front of the other viewers and the rest of the viewers  ie common mass were watching it helplessly  rather enjoying the candid attitude and behavioral pattern of jim carreythey stopped him from pursuing his own desires failed him in school rest of all the others who were with him were just a part of the huge studio as made by the director and were acting all the time  making a fool of him  so basically he had no true friend  all actors but a human director is after all just a human in comes a lady  who tries to warn jim of his delusion and gives him hints of his freedom but soon the director and the other team members take over and make jim fall in love and even eventually marry the one they chose for him he was shown carrying on with life reluctantly when suddenly he realizes that things are not what it seems to be  he then starts to investigate and finally break opens the cocoon studio premises he had been living in for so long  demigod aka director tries to give him a lot of hard ships  storm tempest etc but he could not stop truman jim from manifesting his own true self this is the case with every human being  but most of them are happy as actors  some as helpless knowledgeables witnessing the suffering of a poor man who is being fooled by the entire world but are still sitting pretty about it  very rare few have the guts to break open the cocoon like swami vivekananda and his kinds who when open up their respective cocoons let the entire world know of it and its possibilities ,black_comedy
the matrix teratology  dark city these 3 movies have the same goal searching for truth  the real self what is real are the things you can see hear or smell real think about it one can meditate on it thats the everlasting question of human kindbtw these quotes are greatthe early bird gathers no moss the rolling stone catches the wormgood morning and in case i dont see ya good afternoon good evening and good nightoh youre too late theres nothing left to explorei have given truman the chance to lead a normal life the world the place you live in is the sick place,black_comedy
is a brilliant film and is unlike any other film jim carrey has starred in i think it is by far his best performance the film is certainly uplifting due to peter wiers brilliant direction and it works brilliantly the idea is a bit farfetched ill be truthful it is incredibly farfetched and will never happen because creating a world within a world is not humanly possible forgetting about that its very enjoyable and has one of the best ending climaxes ive ever seen in a film is like nothing else and is different for all the right reasons i dont normally like jim carrey infact i hate him but i loved him in this film and id recommend it to anybody ed harriss portrayal of christof the creator is brilliant and he certainly contributes to the brilliant ending its a brilliant filmsee it,black_comedy
theres an old doors song that has the chorus line break on through to the other side and it comes to mind as i write there are many movies now that begin by showing us an everyday mundane version of our world and then have the central character breaking through to something much more meaningful and significantprobably the matrix is the best example of such a movie where a computer message implores neo to wake up and begin a journey that has him uncovering an alternate reality and then there is groundhog day where a nice cosy small town visit leads phil connors to move beyond the selfishness that has trapped him to being a more expansive and loving human being even star wars has a dual reality theme with a deeper reality being evident in scenes with the force the light sabre scenes with darth vader in particular are fights between spiritual warriors not ordinary beingsand then we come to where wideeyed truman true man burbank jim carrey begins to suspect that his calm and routine everyday existence in the town of seahaven has another side to it nothing is quite what it seems its as if truman is in a prison and gradually he pieces together the jigsaw puzzle of his entrapment faces his fear of water and literally opens the door to another worldis yet another example of a movie that can be enjoyed at two levels a popular film from hollywood as well as a spiritual allegory that raises fundamental questions about our lives what could have been an ordinary film is lifted up by an intelligent script as well as good acting and directing its a movie that is well worth seeing more than once,black_comedy
how great can a persons imagination be is the question ppl ask when they finish watching this masterpiecedont start doubting yourself after seeing this movie the point worth mentioning is it is a recursion  u watch the people watching someone else  jim carry with one of his best performances the direction and screenplay were just perfect and the settings too good to be true overall its a collection of gr8 things the movie is about trumanjim carrey in a small island and guess what there are people watching truman other than you to be precise because of his childhood incident he is afraid of water and so he never left the islandthe overall performance was good though majority of the time its truman on the camera or shud i say cameras the climax is excellent signifying what a human wants and that no one wants the world to be perfect and safe its just a get together of goodies dont miss the fun and the adventure of truman and his show,black_comedy
whether this film man on the moon or eternal sunshine of the spotless mind is the better film is your decision but you cannot deny that is one of the better movies of the 1990sa giant studio made to mimic a town is built for just one man and just one show a weirdo that has some dream of some controlling every aspect of one mans life a weird nerd that is loved by all played of course by jim carrey this film has everything what more could you ask for sure some of the things that christof says can get annoying and carrey isnt doing a superserious roll but who cares its just funwhat isnt fun is the weird feeling you get watching this movie you know that the matrix feel as you watch you start to wonder could this happen to me is this happening to me how would i know it really adds some flare to the story,black_comedy
i thought the trueman show was one of jim carreys best performances he should be playing more serious roles in films like this one i think since he became really successful through comedic movies like the mask or ace ventura he was categorized as a comedic actor i think if he didnt accept those roles he would be offered more serious roles today and i think he would be successful at it i liked all of the irony in the movie like all the scenes that were related to the bible this is one of the movies i really paid attention to the detail and not just the entertainment aspect of the film id like to see jim carrey in more serious roles in the future if youve only seen jim carrey in comedic roles this is a movie you should check out,black_comedy
within the first few minuets of watching this movie in my film studies class i immediately knew i would like it our main character truman burbank played by jim carrey is just about one of the most famous men in the world and he doesnt even know it he is raised entirely in a television show which changes his entire world he goes around thinking that he is this normal guy with a normal life but unknown by truman his entire life is one of the top rated tv shows of all time 24 hours a day 7 days a week for all of his life thousands of hidden cameras have been following his every move threw this entire movie you find yourself cheering on truman and hoping that everything turns out aright in the end you will just have to watch the movie to find out what happens,black_comedy
have you ever felt like this movie was telling your life story after seeing this movie ive always thought what if it kind of seems like i am being watched or i am the main character of a huge tv production sometimes jim carey does great job being the overfriendly perfect person his quirks and humor made watching more entertaining at time i really felt bad for him and i really got into the film and the plot some of the zoomouts used were really well done the one shot where it started as a zoomed in shot on truman and then to a quick zoomout making the it seem like u were looking from the moon i think overall this movie was a great one and worth the time spent watching it,black_comedy
jim carry gave one of his best performances in they couldnt have picked a better actor all of the supporting actors and actresses where just as good they made this movie believable is one of the best films i have ever seen you get all the emotions and drama that makes a movie good how they come up with this idea for a movie is incredible if this were a true tvshow it would definitely be the ultimate reality tv show there isnt a person out there who i think could say that they didnt like this movie jim carrys performance was unforgettable and definitely oscar worthy i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes good movies,black_comedy
ive seen many movies  and of course  many hollywood movies although of other descent  i usually favour european film  yet  more and more  and so often in the past  the us makes the most wonderful and deeply moving films  yet does not recognise its own art for its worth especially in terms of awards but  they  the awards are just objects  the celluloid evidence lives on and time proves the real worth of films well  lets move beyond that issue this is a disturbing and wonderful film so well directed so insightful so moving i am so sure this will stand the test of time have you ever thought  in a shakespereanhamletclichd sense that all of life is but a stage have you ever thought of a play within a play of course we all question our existence  our god our creator our boundaries limits loves the things we think we remember this film addresses all those issues in a fun deep and very sensitive way moreover  in this age of reality tv this film takes us to what surely must be the natural conclusion of this trend the absolute and utter abandonment of the viewer to an existence of vicariously living through the idiots lantern in the corner of the room any film that makes us think that poses more questions than it answers is wonderful any film of that kind sensitively directed wonderfully shot and with incredible casting script and acting  is more than wonderful thanks mr wier et al for a masterful creation  i would recommend anyone to watch this  it works on many levels and will appeal to many people from all vestiges of society watch out for the boundaries in your lifewatch and youll see what im talking about ac,black_comedy
this film was a great film which relates to the american dream that every american family wants to live it has an awesome twist at the end and a unique plot its a film that no one has thought of and different from any other film its originality and cute humor in the film makes you smile and think at the same time i enjoyed this film and jim carrey is the perfect actor to play truman it really makes you thinkis rated 8 in my mind because it was mind filling and humors it makes you wonder if maybe your life is just one big television show i give it two thumbs up and a smile because i loved jim carey in this film and in case i dont see yougood afternoon good evening and good night,black_comedy
at first i didnt completely understand why there were so many different shots or views from different angles but after awhile it got the audience to put it together that truman was actually being watched it was interesting to see how truman got pushed against posters for advertisement even his own wide did a hot cocoa add in his house it was funny to see how far people would go just to get a product out in the public since they know that people were always watching in a way i dont think that it was fair that truman had to go through his life thinking that his father died in a horrible accident but the movie has a good ending since truman comes to realization and finds out that his father is still alive,black_comedy
the first time i saw i was amazed for many reasons one of them was the wonderful acting skills of the cast especially jim carrey and laura linneythe story is basically the life of truman burbank who isnt aware that his life is the most popular reality show in the history of television there are many moments in the movie where i felt like killing some of the characters or feel incredibly desperate for trumanweir uses clever camera angles as if were really watching i wouldnt change anything about this movie its original touching and has a great plot i give it 10 stars,black_comedy
can someone live his whole life surrounded by a madeup world truman burbank jim carrey was living it adopted at birth his life was a fake but he was real unbeknownst to him he was the star of the most popular show in the history of television but when something happened that triggered his omnipresent curiosity for what lies beyond the boundaries of his hometown truman decided he might want to see what actually is the rest of the world like the magnificence of this film is just as much as the magnificence of christoff ed harris the creator and director of brilliant acting marvellous storyline beautiful direction thumbs up to the creators,black_comedy
ok i loved this movie i thought the story the screenplay and the acting were all excellent this movie is about truman burbank a man who has been on tv ever since he was born he starts to figure out whats happening and thats when this movie really gets interesting i thought that the whole idea of a man inside a tv show was insane of course its just a movie although when you actually see it its an amazing experience by the end you will be amazed this movie is for people who want to watch something thats very unique from other films this definitely qualifies as that as i said earlier the screenplay is amazing they use types of camera that wouldnt be seen on a movie but of course tv the acting was excellent every character seeming believable to their roles as characters who befriend truman in a fake world all except for truman and christoff the creator of of course filled with excellent drama and wonder this is a movie not to be missed 910,black_comedy
filmed in floridas town of celebration reminds me of the bbc series the prisoner a man fighting to reclaim his own freedom from those unseen forces keeping him captive ive never got tired of this movie the performances the humour the social engineering the overall themes seem to ring true for all of us at one point in our lives or another watching this movie i felt myself identifying with truman and i suspect most people do because he too works and lives a predictable lifestyle that he yearns to get away from and have an adventure ed harris performance is astounding i felt for him just as much as i did for truman and i think thats the beauty of this picture knowing that were seeing all sides to the story and not just one perspective is unusual for a movie that typically revolves around one main character without question i give this movie five stars the soundtrack is good too,black_comedy
this movie is undoubtedly one of those movies that are so original among movies that you could say they are out of this world like for example fight club the matrix 1 etc just the story in itself is already something that one might never imagine in their wildest dreams even though it has the air of a nice and sweet and especially funny family movie and i guess it is meant to be just this the story is one of wild imagination one could not imagine living in a world for 30 years not knowing and not noticing that all the people and i mean all the people that he knows are actors and thus not really the people he thinks they are i mean your father your mother your wife how can this happen it seems not possible but when i got more comfortable with the idea it seemed to me that this could be reality to a certain extent all it takes i guess are some very strong actors close to a person that likes more to be noticed than to notice people around him and jim carrey puts such a person down with great virtuosity and a big group of part figurants part actors who are dedicated to their job and ready to act when they have to and then to think what he must have thought when he found out you can see him getting more and more suspicious and when he first starts to get this suspicion you see him trying to act inconspicuous not knowing which people are part of the conspiracy imagine the train of thought he had when he realized the vastness of this conspiracy containing all the people he knows in it this is too big for words normally when a person has this kind of ideas people say he is mentally ill and probably he is but then to slowly find out it is real what a tremendous doubt this would bring in a person not in the person jim carrey plays because truman has enough of a childs mind left to be able to accept this far fetched an idea if i would have to choose one word for this movie i would most humbly choose the word outrageous,black_comedy
director peter weir is no stranger to challenging subject matter gallipoli fearless as well as the surreal picnic at hanging rock but this film is far more daring than those earlier films  unfortunately marketed as a comedy i was more intrigued with the films dramatic elements and wish that this film was made without the general moviegoing audience in mind   while it works as both a comedy and drama the subject matter is so twilight zoneish and totalitarian that it could easily be turned into a much darker film  but who knows if that would be betterthere are great moments in this film  example trumans who the hell are you talking to as his wife drones on and on to an invisible audience about the wonders of a nicaraguan coffee  ed harris final line sums up the whole tv mentality say something goddam it youre on television  this is one of endings that draws tears no matter how many times youve seen it just because of jim carreys brilliant portrayal of a man who realizes that his entire world has been a fabrication  seeing him banging his fist against his lifes wall rivals anything from any other fantasy films brazil included,black_comedy
so now peter weir has a bafta  for some boat movie  well whoopeedo never mind his earlier better movies  such as this  a story about the ultimate betrayal on one hand a deconstruction of the hyperrealist nature of our postmodern lives on the other and an unintentional retelling of doctor who  vengeance on varos on the side this is really something of a minor masterpiece  carreys truman burbank is a putupon hero to rank with george bailey from its a wonderful life a man whose destiny is to come face to face with god and its also better than bruce almighty  one of the more perfect endings put to celluloid caps it,black_comedy
i loved this movie when i first saw it and it really has held up after multiple viewings  if youre looking for the slapstick that carrey is known for then look elsewhere  however if you like original stories presented with great production values and a talented cast then this is your movie 910,black_comedy
would have to be one of the best films of 1998 the film has its comedic parts yet also is very dramatic it marks the suprise turn of slapstick comedy actor jim carey into the dramaserious movies and does it not that badly the themes resonate throughout the film and in the space of 100mins you grow to love the characters and the ending leaves you feeling sad yet somewhat happy for truman as he embarks on his final leg of the groundbreaking show 810,black_comedy
the first time i saw this movie i was a bit confused as to what was going on but i rented it afterwards and then i started to figure it out i have a feeling that jim carrey added a few jokes when he was filming this because they sounded like something he would do it was an interesting story though but a thinker i liked it 10 out of 10,black_comedy
peter weir is one of the most versatile directors ever with all of his movies covering a vast amount of subjects but the other day i realized something else about him that is quite fantastic he has taken several actors who are known for playing a certain type of role and put them in challenging roles that have changed their careers such as jim carrey robin williams and harrison ford i watched ace ventura the other day and was blown away by how annoying carrey was in it almost all of his films before truman show were equally annoying yet weir was able to turn him from a onetrick pony into someone that delivered one of the best performances i have ever seen the same can be said for williams who was not known for his dramatic acting abilities yet weir cast him in a role that was quite touching ford was known mainly as an action star before starring in witness but in that movie he gave a realistic brilliant performance all i can say is weir is the man,black_comedy
yeah well like the title says i always thought this movie would be a lot more in your face especially with jim carrey as the lead but i have to admit i was wrong and it was a really nice movie sometimes even subtle i never thought id use this word while talking about carreyand of course a sublime ed harris as always does this guy ever give a bad performance and the ending was surprisingly unhollywoodi mean in most mainstream movies i always get the impression they feel they have to be too elaborate and exaggerate with explaining everything that happensoverall i give it a 810,black_comedy
how much of an illusion of reality can one create even with the unlimited resources of a profitable tv enterprise a tv producer one christof devises the most artificial environment possible must seem real  indeed the only possible reality  for truman burbank whose life is a tv show and every scene is a stage and every person is an actor except him the ultimate fool from his birth nearly thirty years earlier truman burbank must have the illusion of complete freedom but he cant have it he must also have the delusions of privacy and the genuineness of all of those in on the 247365 scam if he ever figured it all out hed go insane from the absurdity of the situationall is beautiful and everything is a setup even his love interests who must be in on the plot to delude him into thinking that there is but one accessible reality  a world in which everything is a sham if a pleasant one truman has been part of a 24hour tv show the ultimate reality program now in its 10909th straight day and knows nothing else hes beginning to chafe in a world in which he has been legally adopted at birth by a corporation an enterprise created by one christof a tv producer everything depends upon truman burbank staying right where he is in an unreal setup if you enjoyed the old british tv series the prisoner then you will enjoy this too as an intensification this is a brainy movie not so much a blockbuster as a kafkaesque or at least serlingesque tale,black_comedy
what is reality our perception of the real world is based on our immediate surroundings and we have no notion whatever if we are being manipulated or not this is the true philosophy on which this interesting movie is baseda sequel to 1984and brave new world which stresses how modern techniques have evolved to a point where their hold on human beings has become an all overwhelming godlike power jim carrey is great at finding the right balance between humor and seriousness the plot evolves well and succeeds in convincing the viewer that all of this could happen or is happening now admittedly in a deliberately exaggerated representation when truman steps out of his fictitious surroundings one asks oneself if he is going back to reality or just to another form of an imaginary world this is a powerful movie which really makes you think,black_comedy
the movie wouldnt have such an impact on me if i saw it in 98 however now they made a new reality show in israel in trumans style a poor man is being fooled for a few weeks to think he is being elected to play in a new soap opera and the most ironic thing is that they are actually marketing their show by showing us trumans show and advertising their steves show all along the moviei would think that they actually learned something from the trumans show i guess some people are inspired by movies in all the wrong way,black_comedy
a slickly veiled philosophical allegory of platos cave is a triump of social commentary of in the box living and prophetic warning of the surveillance future into which we are all heading yes for in real life truman is you albeit in a sinister vein the film is a also a good representation of spiritual awakening and the need for constancy and aim in overcoming all troubles to walk the path to freedom while appreciating the help we receive along the way,black_comedy
forget big brothered tvall the reality tv shows you see these days this is the real deal the granddaddy of them all the one that got the ball rolling this movie is also significant as it was jim carreys first serious role of note despite the scepticism of the critics jim carries the role with aplomb an outstanding performance in a challenging role,black_comedy
the first time i watched this movie i sat in rapt attention not even daring to jump up for a snack or bathroom break  though ill never relive the experience of watching it for the first time this movie is still phenomenal  underrated this film seems to have attracted a cult following everyone i know whos seen it which isnt many loves itjim carrey ed harris and laura linney give wonderful performances in this film about reality and unreality fears and desires and godhuman relationships  i cant identify one overarching theme because this movie deals with so many different philosophical ideas as well as raw emotions just watch it and be amazed,black_comedy
this movie in my opinion was very well done peter definitely has a great imagination i enjoyed watching the movie because it seems to have a little bit of everything in itfor hollywoods films this one turned out good i would suggest anyone over 13 could see this movie it is appropriate for children around age 10 but they would most likely not understand the plotbut if you have older children and you need a warm sweet enchanting movie this is definitely a good choice,black_comedy
i have seen this movie about 10 times and everytime i see it i love it more one of my favorite parts of the movie is the opening monologue that truman speaks when he is infront of his bathroom mirror it is great about the mountain climbers i enjoy the part of the movie where he starts to catch on as to what is going on around him overall i would say that this is my favorite jim carrey movie to date then would come dumb  dumber and ace ventura pet detective and once bitten,black_comedy
truman burbank a nice insurance salesman living in seahaven one of the last 1950s suburbia left life is the closest thing to perfect not a glitch or a hitchbut then truman played by jim carrey in one of his most countercharacter features starts to realize that his world is just meerly a synthetic model you join him in his quest to find the truth why the world fights him and to find his true lovelight and airy delightful to those young and old but sadly any attempts at a distorted past a darker life or practically anything that the great classics have is left out it strangely marks reality television just a few months before the world saw the synthetic model of survivor and suchfor lovers of jim carrey expecting dumb and dumber or the mask will be dissapointed and others will be whisked away in a very good movie jim carrey plays a role he has only done since in the majestic and scores big,black_comedy
i must admit  when i first saw this movie i was dissapointed probably as i was expecting a jim carrey movie funny and quirky but the the subsiquent times i have watched this has made it a firm favoroute of mine  definately in my top 10 movies of all time and thats a big list belive mewhy you might ask well im not going to describe this movie or give away the plot if you have never seen this watch it and dont think of it as a jim carrey film just think of it as a movie have no expectations and you should be entertained if not wait a month or 2 then watch it again chances are you will watch it again and aginwell thats the way it happened for me this movie and the majestic proves that jim carreys repatios extands to more than just a funny madman not thats theres anything wrong with that,black_comedy
i remember in 1999 there were lots of news stories about how jim carrey was angry at the academy for not being nominated for i think jim carrey was very proud of himself at taking on a serious role and being able to perform it almost flawlessy but this is just a good moviegood not great if anyone deserved an oscar it was ed harris in the role of christof or laura linney as his wife merrill,black_comedy
acting 44screenplay 44preditability 14stomach intensity 14overall 354comments wow this film really gets you thinking jim carrey and ed harris give superb performances the screenplay is entirely original and the directing was astounding easily one of the best films of 1998,black_comedy
this film is suspenseful dramatic funny and wellacted  jim carrey plays the part of truman burbank a man whos life is a television show and hes just realizing now  thats the most unrealistic part of the movie though that he couldnt figure it all out until nowsome of the performances like from linney and emmerich were overacted a little  ed harris plays christof the creator of the show  he plays the character perfectly so well that you can see the emotion in his eyescarrey acts very well too but some of his lines sound like hes bored of being dramatic and wants to be goofy againgood drama 810,black_comedy
peter weir is a genius and this film is the best way to prove it  dead poets society was a better movie but it had a better script to work with and better all around acting  this film rests almost entirely on the shoulders of the morethancapable weirthinking about the positive points of this film it looks like a cant miss 1  andrew niccols mind providing an idea and a script but his hands getting nowhere near the camera hes just too heavyhanded as a director see s1m0ne for proof 2  jim carrey in a dramatic role the man can act but hes not funny and 3  peter weir behind the camera but staying away from the script green card was okay but it was a pretty generic script how could you miss with that  about the only way to improve upon that would be to bring in kenneth branagh robin williams andor kellie martinperhaps the most easily overlooked aspect of this film is the brilliant performance of laura linney as meryl  her performance is purposely more loaded with cheese than many pizzas that i have seen and in fact is the funniest part of the film which incidentally is really a comedy more than a drama or a fantasy  the cheese goes away only when she is truly disturbed by trumans actions and asks how can i be expected to carry on under these conditions  its just not professional  hows that for a bit of a subtle nudge at actorshowever the film is loaded with good performances especially including that of jim i need to quit trying to be funny carrey and that of ed harris  the next two sentences contain a spoiler the look on harriss face after truman walks out the door is one of the greatest facial expressions i have ever seen  one can see in his face that he has lost essentially his son and that his child essentially chose to live in another world without him  the power of that scene cannot be questioned    meanwhile carrey manages to make his loveably quirky somewhat dullwitted character very believable throughout the film though he does not have a scene that gives him the ability to create a look with the power of the aforementioned one by harrisyet the films power comes mostly from its direction  weir knows exactly what he is doing with the camera placement  in fact it is almost as though he has been planning this show in reality  there is never a shot in seahaven that seems impossible for a camera being used inside the set to portray and the idea of using the television screens for the cameras in the homes of the average people is amazing  he even consistently manages to bring out christofs fatherly relationship to truman in the scenes in christofs studio is that what youd call it with the way christof is almost always looking down at truman and other small details like that while niccols screenplay is certainly not bad even a director like steven spielburg probably would have ruined this film  it had to be peter weir and since it was the film turned out brilliantly,black_comedy
this movie tends to elicit strong emotional responses who doesnt feel lost with truman against that oceantruman show is a brilliant movie subject matter is equal parts entertainment culture and life in private bubbles with some interesting side commentary about education intelligence gathering little white lies family matters mass marketing and many thingsim not too pleased with the academy awards to say that carrey harris and weir should have each received more than nominations for this some people have a quiet modesty about accepting and supporting the choices of the academy awards and there is cultural impoliteness in reaction to criticism of academy award judgments i no longer understand why people should feel modest about a system they do not take part in but i can understand that people believe theyve taken part in that system when its judgments reflect their own in any case sometimes seeing great artists receive nothing more than lifetime achievement awards as a concession for the judges overlooking them for so long is not very rewarding people who work very hard should receive at least recognition people who are good at their work should be rewarded when an actors career is marked as carreys is by numerous upsets against the academys judgment it becomes obvious that the academy has seriously lost its way,black_comedy
has been described as jim carreys attempt at a serious movie but that statement is a poor representation of the film i would describe it as a brilliant and thoughtprovoking film starring jim carrey carrey is incredible in this film delivering an oscarworthy performance that is both humorous and serious is about a man truman who was adopted by a television company and then placed in a fictional world where he grew up in front of americas eyes unknowingly on television its the story of him discovering this and breaking free after the films terrific conclusion youll question your surroundings and your life a sorely underrated movie10 out of 10,black_comedy
personally i really do think jim carrey was robbed a nomination for an academy award i feel this role and how he executed it was surely worthy ah well life goes on theres always man on the moon damnthe trueman show is a nicely directed and acted affair with a brilliant feel good ending the support cast are great and i was certainly left totally satisfied when i left the theatre when i first watched this filmthis was definately carreys first great performance doing the thesp thing810,black_comedy
after watching multiple times i have decided that it is one of the greatest movies of all times  while i do not consider myself a movie buff i will say i have seen a number of movies in my life and this movie was not only captivating but it moved me  while many people say movies are moving this film made me truly think about the world around me  it was a great cinematic achievement by the way one of the comments said that the town in which truman lives seahaven is unrealistic and i would just like to say that not only is the town realistic but is actually filmed in seaside a planned resort community on the coast of florida  further showing why we should look more closely at our lives,black_comedy
maybe this is going a bit far but personally this is my favorite movie of all time and think this was so well done that everyone must see itthe people who wont like this kind of movie are not opened minded the first time i ever saw this movie i actually dozed off but decided to watch it again and i am extremely happy i did because this movie was so well toughtim not too high on reality tv anymore because there is so many and getting sick of it but probably started all this reality tv i would be very curious to see if they did do something like this in real life i would for sure watch it out of curiosity i saw a few movies saying this was a very unrealisic movie and it sucked because of it well it was meant to be that way and what lord of the rings and harry potter are fictionalanyways great movie carrey at his best and weir incredible director1010,black_comedy
jim carrey plays truman burbank a normal guy who soon discovers his life is a television show he rushes to find the truth as the whole world watches very good movie you somewhat are in trumans journey i liked the film very much jim carrey gives the performance of a lifetime it gives a lot of laughs but is very serious it is able to stay fun truman is a character that everyone can admire see it because it is powerfulbut also fun why didnt jim carrey never got an oscar for this 44,black_comedy
this is a perfect film andrew niccol a genius of frightening allegoriesgattacca s1mone created a brilliant story of a reality tv showbefore we had reality tv shows created by a demented genius known only as christofed harris about the life of truman burbankjim carrey in what is his first and best dramatic rolei cant believe he wasnt nominated who lives the american dream in a pictureperfect island town from the start as you see that everyone he meetsor is supposed to meet is an actor and people are glued to the tv 247 to watch his life unfold the movie is a frightening tale of manipulation reality environment and a number of other things that havent come to mind yet laura linney as trumans nurse wife meryl is hilarious when she picks up an object and speaks to the camera advertising the item to the audience while truman just watches a little bewildered by her enthusiasm noah emerich as trumans beerguzzling best friend comes up with some subtle yet humorous lines youve got a desk job id kill for a desk job natascha mcelhone also shines as the girl who stole his heart exposed him to the truth and now is part of a minority of people protesting to free truman as trumans suspicions arise about his life we feel with truman we become just as intrigued by his adventures as the people watching him on tv and perhaps more compasionately ed harris adds subtle charm to his character as a man who admires his art so much and takes it so seriously that he has come to forget that hes not god and that truman is a person just like everybody else as long as he can keep him afraid of the water truman is a prisoner never going to fiji,black_comedy
i was amazed reading some of the comments about this movie if i hadnt seen it  i would have thought it was the most wonderful thought provoking movie ever made  having seen it  i wonder what all the hype is aboutjim carrey was good no doubt about that  the story was an interesting one but you have to suspend an awful amount of belief to accept the general concept unless i missed something along the way i have to ask where did the money come from to sustain a setup of those dimensions surely not from a tv show that had run for zonks of years  if tv audiences are nothing else they are fickle something like that if it were possible would hold audiences for a year or so at best then  consider the fact that hundreds of people would have to put their private lives on hold for the purpose of convincing one person that his life was real  come on i found that the whole thing was presented with such seriousness to deliberately make the impression that it was making an earthshaking commentim happy to accept this movie as a fantasy an entertaining one on which cast and crew did a good job but earth shaking it is not the best movie of all time  not,black_comedy
this is simply the best movie i have ever seen i think its amazing how it came out in 1998 before the reality tv craze it almost seems like andrew niccol the screenwriter is some kind of prophet jim carrey ed harris laura linney aw screw it everyone does a great job of acting and peter weir is a great director the way he mixes all the different kinds of camera lenses and angles and views is really interesting anyway to sum it all up this is the movie that should have sweeped the 1998 academy awards ive never seen shakespeare in love but i firmly believe it stole the best picture oscar from anyone who has not seen this movie i urge you to see it soon,black_comedy
to state it simply is a modern day classic great concept great script great direction and great performances the movie works in two ways first it is an often hilarious satire of the entertainment industry but its not really a satire of reality tv when truman came out in 1998 the only mainstream reality shows were real world and cops nicols script actually predicted americas and the worlds fascination with reality based programming second and more importantly truman show is a statement about human existence truman represents all of us he is the every man the trueman that may sound pretentious but it works beautifully throw in weirs tight direction and amazing performances by carrey harris and linney and you have one of the best films of the 90s a must see,black_comedy
screenwriter andrew niccol followed up his inspired but slightly uneven debut gattaca with this brilliant peter weir directed film  those looking for dumb and dumber should look elsewhere  i can still remember the inappropriate laughter from those in the theatre during a very profound scene in which truman burbank jim carrey actually touches the limits of his known world for the first time  those who were looking for ace ventura were just dying to laugh at something  those who werent saw the scene for the philosophical statement it really wasthis is an intelligent innovative take on what is actually a fairly standard sf convention  the idea of an enclosed universe combined with the discovery by an inhabitant of that universe that reality is not what it seemsmany thought jim carrey got snubbed for a best actor nomination most prominently carrey himself but the real injustice here was that the film was not even nominated for best picture  niccol was nominated for best screenplay and deserved to win as wellthis is speculative fiction of a kind that hollywood rarely produces gattaca is also highly recommended and despite niccols misstep with simone hes still a talent to be watched,black_comedy
this movie is kind of a take on reality tv the show focuses on jim carreys character truman the cameras follow him everywhere as he is actually living in this big tv studio everyone he thinks he knows are actors including his wife interesting enough but i just have a hard time believing this show would have stayed on the air from this guys birth to the point of being a grown man with a wife no show lasts that long and this show would be rather dull one to watch this one is at its best when it is more comedy oriented unfortunately it is more of a drama and takes itself to seriously when it should be more fun to watch carrey does do a good job in the main role but ed harris is just too bland for me i cant believe he was nominated for an oscar for this rolehe just was not very good to me i also dont think this tv show is realistic in that i would think it would be illegal to keep someone basically as a prisoner without their permissionall the faults aside though it is a rather good movie to watch i just wish it were a bit funnier,black_comedy
i saw this movie when it first came out i thought it was intelligent witty amusing and an interesting concept i also thought it was jim carreys greatest performance at that time little did i know that a lot of television show executives were apparently watching as well now five years after its release watch this movie then look at the programming on tv and ask yourself one question  could be that far off the answer may surprise you,black_comedy
ive seen the movie and my commentary fantastic this film shows the modern society by making it ridiculous truman is shown as a controlled man who doesnt know anything about the real world in this film the society in this case the movie society is shown in an exaggerated way and by this the producer wants the people to think about this its like a parable in the bible it shows that people often dont think about what they do and that everybody does everything for money or repotation,black_comedy
the worst thing about this film is that is was probably the direct inspiration for all the big brother reality tv crap that saturates the tv listings these days but still its now a satire immaculately directed with an ingenius script and jim carrey doesnt become annoying after watching it a second time,black_comedy
i saw this movie when it was shown in the theatres it stuck and after having watched it recently i labelled it classic fine performances from carrey who shows us that he can do drama too serious romantic lead and from harris didnt even recognize him damn that man is good this is one movie that makes you think the take on the film world the triplelayered jokes the fun poked at a very serious matter the lack of respect for privacy that stars generally entertain trading off against financial opportunity it certainly is a filmmakers film and it is accessible enough for us  general filmgoers bonus it is funnyfour stars from me,black_comedy
sporting performances of depth and subtlety and with a brilliant storyline is an exhilarating satire on media saturation in the modern world  whilst it is certainly flawed to a degree the pictures plot and theme ring true all too often  the effect is chillingjim carrey plays truman burbank a quiet mildmannered insurance worker in the small coastal town of seahaven  what he has been unaware of up until this point is that his entire life from the day he was born has been filmed as part of 24hour tv show and that everyone he knows even his wife and best friend is an actor  seahaven itself is really a gigantic set built for the show  but little by little truman begins to suspect the truth culminating in a rebellion that shatters the very foundations of his existencewith shows like big brother and castaway playing with the very idea of reality tv not to mention media obsession with celebrity really hits home and acts as a very powerful cautionary tale about media greed power and intrusion  the film argues that surrendering to media power will mean we lose the ability to think and act for ourselves the film ties this in with an attack on smalltown life seeing it as stuffy restrictive and fake  this theme is embodied in seahavens surroundings which are beautiful but ultimately synthetic and the people that inhabit them actors who have become too used to routine and who repeat the same lines and moves day in and day out  the analogy to the real thing is both subtle yet shockinggradually seeing through all this is jim carrey as truman  unlike films like ace ventura and dumb and dumber this is a role where carrey really gets to stretch his acting as opposed to just his facial muscles  he pulls the role off very well creating a convincing character who never loses his essential goodness even as the disturbing reality of his life eventually becomes clear to himanother terrific performance is ed harris as the shows creator christof who controls trumans every move from a room hidden in the sets moon christof appears to care alot about truman but hes really only concerned with ratings and money and this is what finally proves his undoing carrey and harris are supported by an array of brilliant wellcast supporting players who served very well by a witty and suspenseful script the scenario isnt entirely perfect  in fact the whole setup appears so fragile it seems a wonder truman didnt work the whole thing out earlier but this is a very minor flawwelldirected and very wellacted stands as a frightening but thoughtprovoking parable on media power that is still very relevant in these chaotic times,black_comedy
is a work of genius peter weir deserved every accolade you can throw at him and should win best director for this film he wont though stever spielberg will grab it for the much overhyped saving private ryantechnical stuff jim carrey is a perfect truman burbank others could have played him just as well but jim carrey was spectacular and should not be penalised for not conforming to the roles the public wants him ined harris is unbelievable as christof and deserves an oscar nominationthe story is scarily possible all thats needed is that the government legalise a corporation adopting a child from there very very few laws would be broken the only possible one i can see is illegal arrest we can assume they managed to beat that one once early on and from then on simply refered to the precedent otherwise all the technology exists and if the ratings are as good as the film claims itd probably be profitablenow the meaty stuffthis film at its core is not about human mentality or about the morality of captive lives it is about predestination truman is the job or peter figure of the story a true man among a sea of false men christof whose name clearly derives from christ is a powerful god figure deliberately written as on a god kick and why not this is his world with his perfect script in action to him when trumans old father tries to come back into the show its not just a rebellion its sinthe question ultimately asked is this if you know the way your life will progress and cant change it but it is a happy path will you accept it or attempt to take the reins of your life back into your handstruman burbank is told ever so subtly shut up and well get you the best life you could ever have when his mariage breaks down a new wife is conveniently found because hes behaving to plan when he misbehaves hes quietly shown back to his houseand yet he keeps persisting now certain that something lies beyond his life and that somehow that something else is better the final confrontation deliberately cast with biblical overtones emphasises this point and when truman passes even this test with his life in the balance christof talks to truman with infitite pride and love this is his sonand as we learn a prodigal son,black_comedy
is truly one of jim carreys best performance besides talking through his butthole but us carrey fans will not forget his first drama doing time on maple drive im very surprised that maple drive got 90 out of 10 and truman got 82 out of 10 his performance might be a breakthrough or a breakdown maybe if he wins the golden globes or better yet the oscars hope he wins best actor not tom hanks ,black_comedy
ive seen a lot of movies but this movie was the best of all ive seen definitely better that titanic yuk it has everything comedy action great acting i think it was jim carreys best and just an overall great story i think that it was a very good idea for a movie and they did it up very well anyway thats my opinion da best,black_comedy
this movie is one of the best movies i have ever seen jim carrey and ed harris both give brilliant performances the movie is very original i urge you to see it you cant go wrong with,black_comedy
with 2001a space odessey this is one of only two films worthy of ten marks out of ten it is that good one day someone will tell me how jim carrey went from a dozen 1 out of 10 films to this without any 5 out of 10 films if this doesnt get the oscar for best film then perhaps we should start another awards ceremony this time for people that watch films,black_comedy
it is rare that i leave a theater and think anything more about a film besides that it was funny or cool or whatnot  however with i found myself pondering its ideas for weeks  what an interesting concept  disturbing yet really interesting at the same timei was also quite impressed with jim carreys acting skills he has redeemed himself for dumb and dumber,black_comedy
we all know the age old saying comedic actors will always be comedic actors  well this code has been broken in the summer release by jim carrey  yes the jim carrey from the cable guy and ace ventura 1  2  though this rule has been broken before robin williams in good will hunting awakenings and dead poets society but never this well  in truman burbank carrey the first person to be born on tv is the unsuspecting host of the television show named simply which has sparked trumania in the nation  truman goes unsuspecting of his certaintobetrapped doom in the tv show  but one day while heading to work an object falls from the sky  he listens to the radio suspecting the odd but the djs cover it up saying an airliner dropping parts  thinking nothing of it truman goes on continuing his life in his little town while the day night weather patterns and even trumans life is controlled by one man christoff harris aka the creator  his pleasant life is disrupted though after odd things happen his dead father comes back a man trumans never met before knows his name an elevator has no back to it etc  he slowly catches on that his life is not what it seems to be  with a fabulous screenplay written by andrew niccol gattaca this turns out to be one of those films where after you see it you come out feeling good and thinking  what if your world is like that  is your world like that  this movie is definitely oscar bound a sure fire nomination for carrey in his second serious role his first being in the fabulous madefortvmovie doing time on maple drive the only snag is in the chance to see a talking butt give an acceptance speech is tom hanks in saving private ryan  but i still say free truman  awe accept the reality with which were presented christof,black_comedy
a very thought provoking film the truman story could however have gone a lot further  it should or rather could have been a great deal more evil and this would have put it into a whole new ballpark  the story idea is original and exciting but i felt that it gave in to the pressures of hollywood commercialism by not setting itself apart from other romancedramas  this it could have done with a really black evil emphasis  one of jim carreys best performances well done to the boys from down under,black_comedy
good movie it was nice to see jim carrey this way in his earlier movies the only or most of the comedy was jc himself but he has definitely taken a turn for the better in liar liar it was the situation that was funny jc only made it more funny i must admit that the only time i fell off the chair was after the movie where they showed the mistakes but in it really came through the drama and comedy were perfectly balanced the one thing that really was astonishing was that i found myself doing precisely what i thought was morally wrong i was sitting there and following his entire life to every detail and wanted more i almost wished that i was there in that movieworld watching the tv following his every move when i realized that i really loved the movie it sucked me in and spat me out again i really hope that i wasnt the only one that understood the irony because thats what in my opinion makes the movie great,black_comedy
perfect carrey is great  simply put carrey deserves an oscar for his portrayal and the movie as well,black_comedy
this is the only movie from the entire summer season that ive been looking forward to and i was quite scared that id be disappointed when i finally walked into the cinema but  without a reason is the best movie ive seen this year i think i admire most how whole it seems from the beginning to the end we have been watching and not the movie about truman show although there are bits of that as well  and i feel that this is its only flaw i enjoyed every line and every scene in it the movie is full of excellent writing and directing the way that peter weir doesnt want to show trumans deepest emotions when he finally finds exit but instead hides his face from us and let us imagine how truman feels or how motive of escape to fiji evolves in the movie first its just a remote place on the earth where truman wants to escape then its a place where his love lives and finally its a map of fiji that hides trumans escape and so in a way fiji becomes trumans escape also the amount of our identification with truman is amassing and unseen in hollywood movies for years and if you havent seen the movie and youre afraid that its very serious ie boring i can reassure you its not boring  its funny and time just flys by i would say that this movie is a must for everyone especially those who think that jim carry cannot act i was one of those but ive changed my mind ps ive seen once an episode of the twilight zone with the same main plot but it ended differently,black_comedy
this film is definitely one of the best films of the 90s the story of a man who lives in his own tvshow is very original jim carreys performance as truman burbank is superb and long after youve gone home from the cinema this film will be echoing in your head peter weir the director is a master in the portrayal of human emotions and he does it again in this film the end is absolutely beautiful i can recommend this film to anyone,black_comedy
hi truman show is quite a good movie but not for me coz im a comedy action horror and scifi movie loverpeople who like dramas will love jim in this movie coz its his first drama movie of the 90s and that all the sad parts of the movie turn to be happy in the ending which i like because i dont always like dramas ending sadly,black_comedy
this was a great movie because it showed that there are still some original ideas left i enjoyed it very much,black_comedy
the consciousness of the individualist is only able to imagine the individual consciousness somewhere between the illusion of power and the realization of no power exists the existential nightmare which we observe in truman he is indeed trueman and can be identified with perhaps more than any hero in the history of the screen simply because he is the screen and we are given awareness of the fact truman will be destroyed by the outside world  maybe a bit pessimistic  because he will become the greatest celebrity in the history of the role whereas to him our earth is his heaven our heaven is his unimaginable and the frightening realities violence pollution are his hell so where is truman burbank really going when he passes that irradiated threshold,black_comedy
this is one of the best movies ever made i rank it right up with star wars and other movie greats  not only is the plot sublime but the acting is excellent and it very well made do see this movie,black_comedy
everything in this movie was remarkably well done peter weirs direction and feel for the movie made it absolutely awesome he took what could have been a strange goofy movie and turned it into an almost religious experience he also chose to not tell us what happens after truman leaves the studio a wise decision as some would be tempted to show what happens next but an intelligent artist knows you should always leave the auidence wanting more and that is what he has done yet it is still satisfying jim carreys performance is excellent hes funny but he plays truman as a tortured soul and because of the depth of his performance you cant help but feel tremendous pity for truman you almost feel proud when he reaches the edge of his world philip glass and burkhard dallwitx both worked on the score and both composers worked perfectly instead of using one composer for the film using one theme weir stole certain bits because they fit his movie so perfectly when truman falls in love with a beautiful woman and tries to talk to her a piece by chopin palys a composer hired to write music for the movie wouldnt have been as good for that specific scene dallwitzs score was almost sparse but it perfectly fit the mood of the story it was manipulative this whole movie is youll wonder if they want you to like the movie there wasnt a single element that didnt work perfectly this movie lacked violence sex foul language and all the other filth that movies have today thats what sets it apart from others to me pleasantville is often compared to but only because they both deal with tv as subject matter in fact these movies are radically different is an innocent movie with a darker more ominous undertone to it that has a message to it its funny touching and thought provoking pleasantville is about teenagers who fornicate its full of smut and at its core theres nothing but filth and a shallow story that seriously strains credibility if you enjoy intelligent movies and hate it when people walk out of movies like armageddon saying that was awesome then please see,black_comedy
this is the best film of jima carreys performance i used to look down upon himbut i was wrong i have to sayjim carreyyou are a so damn good actor,black_comedy
this movie was terrible very very slow and not at all as i expected it to be  its just another one of those movies that is hyped to the heavensand in the end it does not deliver stear clear,black_comedy
the overwhelming cult of the eternal vigilance we are subjected to is put to an actual event heretruman burbank a typically calm and nothingoutoftheordinary insurance salesman from seahaven us more like anywhere us is a john doe as the rest of themand hes being broadcasted to the whole nation every day every hour every minute of his life he was born and raised inside a giant dome reflecting his actions and his everyday chores viatv to all the world around him and outside his own life the fabulous though simple concept of the big brother is here actually very well written and performed by a jim carrey at his alltime bestthe punchline of the whole film comes when truman jim says you dont have a camera inside my head well no but closevery close,black_comedy
i went to see this movie under the impression it would be just another regular movie however as soon as the movie started i got right into it and by the end of the movie i was wondering if i myself was an actorstar in a movie   i found it very creepy and it made me think a lot about the possible outcomes in our life the documentarydrama at the beginning makes you wonder what is real and what is false the acting in my opinion is very good  10 out of 10 for entertainment,black_comedy
this movie is one of the best movies i have ever seen not only did this movie have the most inventive plot i have ever heard of it is also made phenomenally welloh yeah i know ed harris in person hes a really nice man,black_comedy
is a truly beautiful movie about the most powerful feeling in every human being the wish for freedomjim carrey was surprisingly good in his role of truman burbank ed harris was just frightening as trumans god the producer of the showpeter weirs superb directing made the spectator a voyeur being able to watch everything truman did until the moment he left his little manmade world and went into the real world so the criticisms that the spectators were left without a true ending to the movie are ridiculous it was a logical end to the movie because there no longer is a truman show after truman went away to me this ending was a true masterpiecei never saw a more moving moment in a motion picture than the one where truman took the stairs into the sky found a door which said exit had a conversation with god and left his secure little world for an unsecure future how many people would make the same decision,black_comedy
easily one of the top five movies ive ever seen a twilight zonelike concept with wonderful performances by all ive heard a few very negative reviews from friends so it must be a film youll either love or hate personally im on the love end of the spectrum,black_comedy
i wasnt really interested to watch this movie in the cinema but i saw a lot of pr for this film on tv so i decided to watch  it the beginning of the film wasnt really exciting for first  but after a few minutes i started to enjoy the film i was really excited when truman scaled against the wall and found no way out i thought the film was over but it wasnt christof spoke to truman one of the best scenes i have ever seen in a movie if anyone hasnt seen this film watch it as soon as possible,black_comedy
the film shows horrible idea of perfect tv show it is excellent film and everyone should see what is future of tv,black_comedy
this is the scariest movie i have ever seen you know that the plot is about true man burbank discovering that his whole life is a tv show and that everyone he knows is in fact an actor paid to let him think his life is heaven on earth why is it scary is about the ultimate conspiracy a conspiracy that can actually pull it off for 30 years of this mans life creating a make believe world where nothing is even close to what it looks like and it is believable in trumans world about 5000 cameras are positioned around the gigantic set although the governmentiswatchingyouscare is now less than it used to be our lives are becoming more and more public not in the least because of this great internet but mainly because media is bringing everyone much closer to each other and giving us the opportunity to know much more than before making information available on every subject possible what then can assure us that eventually our lives will not be like trumans one big show for everyone to see and fake from the bottom up,black_comedy
in a time when hollywood is producing popcorn fodder movies that cater for the lowest common denominator its very refreshing to see an intelligent film that works on so many different levelsis just such a film on a basic level we have a serious jim carrey film which deals with deception and creation but though watching this film we find that it is so much more than that we have elements of humour satire and quite a few jabs at present day media practices ie turning ordinary people into celebrities through the medium of television evident in british shows such as airport and hotelthis is done on a much grander scale though with all trumans life being turned into a television show what interests me most about this film is the way in which the 5000 cameras are represented on screen that film truman on a daytoday basis and how products are plugged on airin my opinion ranking up alongside lock stock and two smoking barrels as one of best films of 1998 will soon become regarded as a modern classic,black_comedy
i am very glad having seen this movie at the theater  im lucky because i was able to see it before someone tells me the story  i knew it was inspired by louis 19 a movie made in quebec and i was expecting to something slightly the same with a budget ten times greater  i was wrong at the beginning i was amazed and i understood trumans situation only after half an hour  what is funny in this movie is the way it ridiculizes tv programs and soap operas  the sequence when truman meets his father is one of the funniest i have seen in my life,black_comedy
most praise that gets is truly deserved  it is one of the most provocative and inspiring movies of this decade and perhaps all timethe concept of this movie is one that many of us have thought before about our own lives  what if this is just a setup  what if everyone in my life is just acting playing a big joke on me  this concept coupled with brilliant screenplay cinematography and acting makes a definite winnerparticularly notable is jim carrey proving once and for all that he is not just a rubberfaced slapstick actor but can really give a character a personality  ed harris is powerful again as christof the creator ofone of the largest gripes about this movie is its ending and those reading this who dont want to know should stop right herethere are complaints that the writers left the audience hanging that the audience wants to know  what happens to truman  what happens with his true love what happens to christof  many people call this the downfall of the effect of the movie but i find it to be one of the truest and most provocative aspects of it  the reason that we do not see what happens to truman is because we are no longer seeing  when he steps out of that door we are no longer privy to what is after all his life why didnt the writers write out a more fulfilling ending for truman because his life isnt written out for him anymore  no longer is he subject to what others feels he should do  he and we are freed with his final step through that door,black_comedy
this film has a very good chance to win the famous academy award for the best movie i think this film is a possibility to see like huge the power of the television is of course the story is too unrealistic however you watch some very important facts of the television which are included in our tv programme for example commercials ed harris plays his role so realistically that i think he owns a tv station or hes a producer in the movie he fells like a god over a small world he is ruling over this small town and its inhabitants if you want watch a very funny and intellectual movie is the best movie for a long time,black_comedy
although a novel concept the film was unrealistic the character was conditioned by his environment but all healthy humans have curiosity they are not programmed machines maybe in the future genetically modified people will be like truman in the context of the film he is made to look stupid and oblivious of his  manmade surroundings  in reality he would have discovered the truth much earlier  the film however raised more interesting points about the captive audience and how the distinction between fact and fiction reality and makebelieve can become blurred when people want to escape from their own existence  the giant leaps in technology that can be expected will make films like seem like the silent movies of the 20s to our grandchildren i look forward to the exciting possibilities that the future will bring but as in the film we must always be brought back to reality,black_comedy
i went to tts with high hopes for a sf  conspiracy type movie on those aspects it was a bit of a disappointment mainly due to its very far fetched details still it was fun watching and was worth my bucks even though it was not what i hoped for id still give it an 8,black_comedy
the media hype blitzed this movie was quite inflated i greatly was impressed by this movies concept the movie was not exactly a disappointment but it lacked certain elements that would have done more justice to this fine story1 the story left so many loopholes that could have been filled with more creativity 2 after trumans discovery the movie ends abruptly without even showing his expression was jim carrey incapable of expressing those much awaited emotions or wasnt there enough timefilm 3 many of us go to see jim carrey movies to see jim carrey we did not see him anybody else could have done the same role with more or less the same effect4 the secret lover of truman could have been used with more creatively she could have sneaked into the set and caught his attention5 truman could have realised something fishy and played along and had a joke or two on them and make them look like fools for a changewell this is what i expected i know its a tall orderwell thats about itnishman,black_comedy
i have never been more positively surprised than i was when i just had watched we all know that jim carrey has played before this film just a bunch of brainless dicks etc ace ventura which was funny though but this movie shows that he can act if this movie doesnt get at least 3 oscars jim carrey ed harris peter weir then shame on you academy ,black_comedy
the first time i was asked if i had seen i had never heard about it then i was explained it was a movie with jim carrey which made me want to see it and when i discovered the subject i went to the cinema bought my place and watched it i was not deceived it is an excellent film with an good plot and good actors the only thing i find bad is that jim carrey has not been able to change completely his way of playing his rule indeed truman is too much closer to ace ventura when trying to make humour the only difference being that he does not succed in making his neighbours laughing because they do not belong to the same world however i think is one of the films i will always remember,black_comedy
a group of us went to see this film all wanting and expecting to like it wed heard that hollywood had dared to produce a film with a new fresh idea  alas we were all disappointed  was it meant to be a comedy it wasnt funny  was it meant to be a thriller  it wasnt thrillingit is a great idea but the film should be very dark very sinister it was way too lighthearted  stop and think for a second  after 30 years the guy discovers his whole lifes a lie  he should be consumed with pain paranoia anger but what do we get from jim carrey  the usual rolling eyes and subjerry lewis grimaces  he cant act paranoid cant act angry heck just cant act  back to the fart jokes jimthings looked up whenever the alwaysreliable ed harris appeared but just as i began to get interested itd be back to the mugging and grimacing routineswhat a shame that peter weir allowed jim carrey to mar what could have been a great film,black_comedy
i liked this movie  firstly because of the innovative idea behind it secondly because i liked watching jim carrey without all the monstrous gestures the role of the director of the show had rather nice godlike overtones and truman also has a rather interestingly horrible wife,black_comedy
a few months agobefore the release ofi read reviews that acclaimed the film as the most interesting and brilliant film ever done by hollywoodi thought that those reviews were really impressiveafter allto receive the label of one of the greatests films ever donecertainly the story should have been very well related in the screen and the cast should have helped a lotthe names in the cast didnt impress meive never liked jim carreyed harris was a good but not brilliant actorand they also had a young actress who worked in congo and who i have already seen before in smaller roleslike in daveher name was laura linneybut i admired a lot peter weirand when i knew he was the directori concluded thatwellthe film could be what the critics were saying and writinghe had already done one striking moviefearlessi watched three timesbut not for thinking that the film was a masterful piece of storytellingi agree that were not talking about a horrible moviebut also the film isnt excellentwe have here a good moviewith good momentsbutwhen analyzed conjointlydoesnt compensateit is just another big and expensive boxoffice attraction that tries to be original and innovatebut tied up into the big studios system of making movie in a commercial senseit  ends up being the kind of movie peter weir wanted to avoidhe wasted the possibility of constructing an unforgettable dramaand made a weak comedyi watched it three times because i saw a magisterial interpretation that came from i less expectedlaura linneyas jim carreys wifeshe created a memorable characteralways with a giant smile engraved on her faceshe should be nominated as best supporting actress and she should take the oscar homeshe builds her character as a woman whodespite her beautyher caress devoted to her husband and her impressive smilehides the truth from himsustains him under her controlinvolves him with her personalityfights to make him give away his suspecionsbutgraduallybegins to fell compassion for himlaura linney managed a smiling woman into the most astonishing character ive seen,black_comedy
at last has reached the mainland of europe and after all the hype i saw on imbb reviews i must confess that i am a little bit disappointed true the movie makes its depressing theme life imitates the media very clear and i would advise every critic who mistakenly calls this a comedy to look up that word in a dictionary and compare the result with the things he has witnessed on the screen the view on society that is pictured in is very bleak indeed still good drama should be believable all the way and it is here that director and scriptwiter let us down the suggestion is that people are watching the show day in day out and never consider switching channels why of course the idea of an actor believing he is leading a normal life is appealing to the audience but is it entertaining as well what happens when truman goes to sleep and his house is dark and silent during seven or eight hours in fact what happened in the first couple of years of his life when he wasnt up to anything more substantial than crying while lying down or whatever an infant does to pass the time it is hardly likely that viewers enjoyed the continuous sight of an infant solely for the reason that it wasnt aware of this immoral intrusion of its privacyanother weak point in the story is the fact that the artificial nature of seahaven becomes rapidly visible during the film while up to then the phoney aspects of life in trumans hometown were successfully hidden how come never before a lamp fell down from the ceiling how come never before the local radio channel was inadvertently intruded by conversations of the film crew how come it took truman thirty years to discover that the elevator in the building next to his office really wasnt an elevator at all in short what are the odds that it takes a not too dumb guy like truman thirty years to discover within a few days the extent of the manipulation by the film makers the really amazing thing of the movie is that despite all these silly loose ends in the script the viewer is as indignant as he should be about a man being manipulated for such a long time for no other reason than making a megalomaniac getting his kicks,black_comedy
is cinema at its highest pinnacle its the sort of film that all others should be judged against though its pace is consistent never reaching fever pitch its concept is ground breaking and its storyline magnificent jim carrey is truman burbank an ordinary man living in an ordinary world at least thats how he defines his world for unknown to him he is the star of the worlds most popular television show which has captured on film every second of his thirty year existence everyone he knows are actors every situation that arises is perfectly choreographed the idea behind is genius as was the casting of carrey in the title role all too often criticised for his slapstick style in movies such as ace ventura and dumb and dumber carrey puts on the performance of a lifetime as burbank whose life begins to collapse around him also of note are performances by laura linney as trumans stage wife who finds it increasingly difficult to cope with trumans developing ambition to discover life beyond his manufactured world and by ed harris as christof who has singlehandedly created and moulded trumans articifial world the brilliance of is that it works on so many levels and plays up to mans greatest fear that his world is not so secure and perfect as it appears is astounding cinema see it be thrilled see it again,black_comedy
with the game it is the most original film of the last hollywood productions a little weak end but a great work of jim carrey nice change and superb ed harris who will probably fight the oscar with edward burns saving private ryan,black_comedy
what a change it was to see jim carrey in a role not completely nauseating the plot had depth the characters were as cheesy as we have come to expect from american sitcom and the audience was noticeably distraught at the mental torment our hero was put through at the expense of entertainment obviously an attack on societys own flaws and selfish attitudes had the auditorium filled with happy smiling children while their mothers went off to complete their shopping i couldnt help feeling during the showing that at the points where i was beginning to wait anxiously for the next setpiece  werent these kids asleep fidgeting the advent of the refreshing thespian jim carrey is going to have to carry a warning that not all of his films  though harmless may not carry quite the same jest and amusement to the under 18s,black_comedy
the movie is not the typical jim carrey comedy it is a light drama with humor it satisfies any reason you have as to why do you watch a moviefor enjoyment entertainment to make you think to draw a moral lesson yes some of the inspiring thoughts of the movie were  you have to conquer your fears and never give upjim carrey gave justice in his portrayal of the lead character actually i havent seen any write up about this but personally i think truman was a variation of true human the image christof wants truman to be and his last name was taken from the city in california that is near hollywoodanyway the concept is unique but the thought of truman was being watched by millions of viewers and the crew in christofs world we as the movie viewers watch truman also just like trumans audience i myself became attached to his character as i shed a tear in the movies ending i became involved in the storyline that when i went out of the movie house i feel like i was being watched myselfbut then after the show i went out to find more other things to watch,black_comedy
what a film  thi is simply the best movie after psycho that i have ever seen  jim carrey proves his worth as a top actor and the surprising but welcome lack of his famous rubber face was a treat the rest of the cast also did a solid job in making this film the undoubted hit of the year excellent performance all round 910,black_comedy
is most certainly one of the best movies so far this year this movie was funny sad and powerful with performances that are top notch  jim carrey better get an oscar nomination for his portrayal of truman burbank  carrey was perfect as the typical leave it to beaver kind of guy who turns out to be a real person who has real feelings  you see its not the leave it to beaver part that is so great about his performance its the metamorphic change that occurs in truman where he moves from the leave it to beaver guy to the real man who will stop at nothing to know the truth  this isnt a movie where you can just sit back and enjoy the ride  you have to think and if you look close enough you will see the quietly powerful message the message of hope and freedom the idea that no innocent man or woman can be kept in some place against their will and the idea that if deception is involved then eventually truth will prevail and hope and freedom will be restored,black_comedy
great thanks weir for the pleasure of watching the most revolutionist movie since pulp fiction a brilliant script probably best picture oscar will go to pr ryan but nobody can prevent truman show to win best writing it is also very nice to see that carrey is not only a monkey using mimics but what was the problem with sylvia to be a wife why was it prevented anyway a must to see for a 2nd time,black_comedy
spoilersive never been a fan of jim carey but the idea behind this film intrigued me  im glad i saw it because it is an incredible work  in fact i am duly impressed with the completeness of the entire project  the script direction performances and attention to detail all mix to create a veritable trompe l oeil much like the fictitious world of trumanthis innovative film appeals to so many compelling concepts the ubiquitous dint of television the inclination of people to live vicariously through others the turbid line between reality and the illusory and the paranoia that someone is always watching us  at times i think that i must be some unwitting actor on a giant stage being manipulated by some demiurgic force because the world seems too ludicrous not to mention the people that inhabit it to be realof course the most piquant aspect of the movie is the exploration of the idea of a higher being  trumans quest for the truth of his specious world is analogous to mans search for the meaning of religion and ultimately god  this is played out masterfully here  when the transmission is cut a person from the barroom exclaims jesus god in heaven  as truman nears his escape sylvia from outside of the fake world ironically prays for his deliverance  christof catch the name played by ed harris sits in his control room as the eminence grise of trumans world  as the creator of the tv show that careys character dwells in his position is plenary  the trouble is that truman has questions that his ostensible family and friends cannot answer  truman knows his life is a mendacious trap and he wants manumission  ultimately truman and christof collide at the boundary of the faade as the former forces a theomachy  the omnipotent entity tries to force his recalcitrant subject to repent and return to his existence but he refuses and finally rejects his originator other moments in the film are as entertaining as the concepts are deep  the technological glitches are amusing and the people trying to get on the set and warn him are great esp the guy jumping out of the christmas present the viewers are interesting too the lady who ignores her crying child in order to see the show the elderly women who watch so intently and of course the security guards who provide the movies prescient ending when they realize the show is finally over what else is on,black_comedy
while watching this film the whole time i was thinking could this happen the premise of this movie is a man in a goldfish bowl  television programmes have been flyonthewall but this tells the story of a prisoner not knowing he lives a fantasy  curiosity kills and thus it kills the world that truman lives in asking the question why cant we just accept things the way they are when we question it things go wrong  i loved this movie it has the tightness within the conventions of the film that makes films like die hard so good the camera hardly ever moves out of the confines of the studio that is burbanks world  from watching this we should question the morality of television does it have the right to invade our lives or has it become second nature to our lives and we should simply accept it as the normality of the way we live today  the only real problem i have with this film is it ends too quickly i would have enjoyed an extra 3040 minutes at the end to conclude the film satisfactorily,black_comedy
i agree with the many comments that the first half was difficult being old and not too fast on the uptake only when i caught on to the fact that the entire island was a tv set did i really get into it after that it was great my wife didnt make the transition and thought it was the stupidest movie ive seen maybe because she is a soap opera fan and likes to watch real life drama,black_comedy
how  jim carrey didnt get an oscar for this is a mystery to me given the power i would let this would sweep the board like all classics there are many levels and subtleties that i am always finding the sting is another fine example so much in the background and the film has a consistent tone of both cynicism and optimism you can read it as one man beats the system or the inevitable point that reality tv will one day reachremember this preceded the craze the actors are all spot on esp the background actors who manage to switch on command providing an eerie prisoneresque environment and of course if i could nominate a set for best actor seahaven wins hands down excellent work all round guys a thing of beauty is a joy forever john keats,black_comedy
is now considered one of the best films of this decade i think it deserves that and a lot more its the story about a person called truman burbank jim carey who lives in a giant world simulation since he was born with 5000 cameras inside it just to make one diary television program truman doesnt notice that his home land is a gigantic set built by and obsessed man ed harris which is the creator of where all the occupants and workers in the city are actors of hollywood even his perfect women dream is a hired actress gradually truman slowly comes to lose his mind and when he finds out his discovery will make us laugh cry and entertain as not many other movies made it until today,black_comedy
this movie showcases jim carrey well and the plot is great carrey delivers a terrific performance as a man who unbeknowenst to him and only him is the star of a 24hour 7 days a week soap opera which chronicles his life as a plot carrey believe it or not shows that he can act in this welldone film out of ,black_comedy
many thanks to peter weir for winning us a surprisingly talented actor jim carrey this dark comedydrama with its beautifully and precisely webbed plot cinematography and string of ideas is definitely deserving many academy awards but will not get them i was overwhelmed and scared by everything the director superbly presents us what we already know and enjoyed every moment of being the voyeur and when i got out of the theater the voyee the soundtrack is definitely worth buying and the movie itself is worth seeing for a second time but the trailers thanks to the wellpraised  media i think spoil the surprising and spooky feel ed harris steals many scenes even from the superb jim carrey a must see for the mediaaware crowd,black_comedy
jim carrey was really great in this film there was comedy but not so much that makes it stupid the romance scenes were really emotional the concept of this film really blew me away most of jim carreys other movies are kind of stupid at worst silly stupid at best he actually looks a lot better when hes acting slightly normal i wish all of his films were like this,black_comedy
i have seen this film many times and i can say that i am ready to see this many other times  there are several reasons but the most important one is certainly jcarrey  i have seen many films in which he acts but in this film he is really excellent  and the next most important reason is aniccol the writer and the director of gattaca  if you liked gattaca you will probably like this one because you will see the same kind of strange worldi advise people to see this film also because of eharris who is one of the greatest actors today,black_comedy
okay john thomas you are partly right but with little hints that are not too visible people might think that it was rushed through writing that is a good twist thoughanyway this is a fine film the story takes something that lots have suspected they are always watched puts on it something weird always watched by millions and makes an unforgettable script and film dont miss it,black_comedy
this film rightly forecasted that a voyeuristicdominated society like western consumerist america pop culture will move toward peeking through the windows as the next step in tv programming  already this week the cbs network is building up anticipation for survivor 3 africa and big brother 2 while other broadcast and cable networks follow with much of the same mtvs real world of a few years ago  in the world of truman burbank the allseeing allknowing supposedly christof plays god with maniacal gusto  hes like the grand inquisitor in the brothers karamazov director peter weir and original screenplay author andrew niccol have shown convincingly their audience that todays pop culture in the light of day is pathologically or at least neurotically obsessed with oncamera peers who have been manipulated into mazelike situations and problems mainstream tv audiences according to ratings surveys want to watch religiously as people are voted off or lose a challenge for a weekly dosage of bread and circuses  from scene to scene truman gets tormented teased and finally caught up in a deadly hurricane as his tv audience sits back and breathes sighs of relief  he does have one true friend inside his tormenting contrived universe a beautiful informertraitor named sylvialauren who cheers his efforts to find a real world apart from the land of the smirks patronizing product placements and constant surveillance will technology and oppressive social control win out over the freedom of the individual to choose to be with honest enabling others  watch this unconventional film on video on independence day to find out,black_comedy
truman show should have won best picture without question  the academy it seems has its own bizarre criteria as well as its own agenda i think its an outrage that it didntthe story itself was simply brilliant  not only that when you think about it the concept of the story is a very difficult one to execute successfully  it would be very hard to show an audience that a certain fellow is living in a madeup world discovering the nature of his world bit by bit and then trying to get out from a life where everyone and everything around him existed just to keep him there  a story like this could very easily have been screwed up  in truman show it was executed flawlessly for those who used their brains during the film it would have been easy to feel trapped and frustrated  i know i was  although most people would have liked to see a more final ending ie actually see truman finally meet sylvia in the end as well punishment of christof most of us like are denouement spelled out for us the ending was just the right amount not to little not too much  trumans escape brought him to sylvia and cut the legs out from under christof  it was absolutely clever  an average person writing this ending would have ruined it with detail and similarity to other movie endingsan oscar for jim carrey and one for ed harris as well  prior to this movie i knew jim carrey had talent but didnt know he could be so versatile an actor  his performance in truman show was superb  the writing was also superb  i thought the scene where sylvia watched truman sailing and holding the picture he made of her was just amazing,black_comedy
is quite an amazing movie  once it ended the first time i saw it i went through the next few days looking for hidden video cameras and suspecting everyone  thats the impact this movie had on me way back in 1998  if i had seen it for the first time in the year 2001 i wouldnt have been quite as shocked since shows like survivor and the mole have become quite common  i pray that a storyline like trumans stays in the movies and isnt transfered to reality tv  anyway bottom line this is an exellent movie that really makes you think  jim carrey proves his talent beyond comedy with this role,black_comedy
whilst this film is a departure from the normal output of major studios i found it quite disappointing the basic premise of the film is certainly intriguing and no detail was overlooked but the ending is a copout wouldnt trumans death have made a much more powerful statement and everything reaches a final hollywoodhappy conclusion good but not that good,black_comedy
not a typical stupid carrey comedy where you watch that funnyguy making notfunny things more serious film but not boring in any way it is very enjoying to watch great script and story and very good soundtrack and ed harris plays great role as cristof,black_comedy
the story for is simply sublime and original satirising the modern need for culture to revolve around reality tv shows  through out the movie there is deep symbolism and irony but the true factor that makes the story so enjoyable is the fact that truman really is as it says a true man  such an honest story with honest characters even in deceit,black_comedy
in 1998 was overlooked for a best picture nomination as well as a best actor nomination for jim carrey but  psycho the classic alfred hitchcock film was also overlooked for a best picture nomination as well as a best actor nomination for anthony perkins  the point is psycho was the only film from 1960 that people really remember no one remembers that the apartment won best picture that year and i believe that in years to come will be the most remembered film of 1998 is a great drama that tells the story of a man whose entire life has been filmed on camera and broadcast as a 24 hour a day show of which has millions of viewers addicted  what makes this film most memorable is the direction by peter weir he turns it into a film that is at times funny but then quickly becomes sad because you feel truman deserves an uncontrolled environment  the cast is perfect noah emmerich plays trumans seemingly best friend who is a slave to whatever the shows creator tells him to do to keep truman from thinking of traveling  laura linney who is finally beginning to get the attention she deserves plays trumans wife who tries to control truman by telling him of his family obligation  ed harris portrays christof the creator of the show  he cares for truman but honestly believes that truman will be much happier in his world than in the actual world ed harris portrayal of the controling christof is brilliant originally the producers of wanted dennis hopper as christof but hopper turned it down i think harris is a much greater actor and gives christof more of a caring side  finally their is jim carrey whose fantastic acting abilities will probably be overlooked for years because he is stil thought of as a comedian only he plays truman as he goes through the difficult days of understanding who he really is to everybody and that his world actually revolves around him will be remembered because of how unique it is as compared to any other film of the nineties it is unconventional and in our computer age seems like something that could actually happen,black_comedy
imagine the film this way                                              lets say the film is called truman and its about a guy who keeps finding things wrong with his world and begins to believe nothing is real  it starts without an introduction to and as far as the audience knows there is no truman show  the story unfolds about a man trying to find something thats real like the romance with that girl who was taken away  he doesnt know why she was taken away and neither do we you see where im going with this  now this would have been a tiresome narrative in such a long movie so naturally it would be very short perhaps it would never be a fulllength film  the realization that his life is a television show would happen at the same time for him as the audience and it would be a great twist ending rather than what it is a clever shortfilm idea stretched into a full length film,black_comedy
starring jim carey satirically documents the life of truman burbank a man raised from boyhood by his corporate adoptive parent in a fictitious hollywood continuouslytelevised world where actors work to convince him of the legitimacy of his life and surroundings the film correctly exposes the artificial nature of the media and the decadence and delusion of the amerikan populace but it incorrectly portrays people blindly led by the media and ignores the possibility of an objective reality the film incorrectly boils the world down to a simple dichotomy of the creator and the created ignoring the ways people can be boughtoff by those in power and thereby dictate or remain complacent to the actions of the oppressorhas been running 24 hours a day for trumans entire life 30 years and has no separate commercials instead product advertisements are included as part of trumans interactions with people truman senses the artificiality of his human interactions why do the people walking down his street come around and around again if he doesnt move and begins to rebel against his life by attempting to escape and committing violent attacks in order to prevent such incidents the creator of the tv show writes experiences into the script that would prevent trumans escape like making truman fear oceans by staging his fathers death at sea and then having actors continuously blame him for the fathers death this method of psychological warfare is accurate as far as how imperialists have worked to suppress the oppressed desire for revolt the oppressor takes away the land and resources of the oppressed and justifies it with religious or biodeterminist examples of racial superiority in both cases material interests are the principal motivation for oppression however much trumans life is artificial and alienating it is not at all materially comparable to the lives of the international proletariat his meaningless life is nevertheless free of violence and provides all the necessities and commodities of a bourgeois existence  when his wife flips out and quits the show the producers even provide a new love interest to improve ratings yet loosely interpreted the film tries to make trumans life a parable on the emptiness of amerikan life as subject to media hype and ultimately the constructions of the capitalist class while amerikan in the movie do little more then stare at they also rejoice when he finally escapes the setevery time truman questions his white picket fenced paperpushing amerikan lifestyle an actor comes along to tell him to stop chasing stars and accept his lot in life most amerikans have unproductive and meaningless jobs too but the film fails to question why few viewers questioned the psychological torture that truman experienced instead like real amerika the characters used their sympathy for the oppressed truman to feel better about the meaningless but materially rewarding lives and jobs they havein the same way very few amerikans have or do question the information that the media feeds them when the media says terrorist or military target it doesnt matter to most in the amerikan populace if either one is fighting for national freedom against imperialism or the other is composed of unarmed civilians the fact is that imperialist actions and media have served the material interests of boughtoff amerika for there to be successful propaganda there needs to be a populace willing to accept the message mim doesnt buy into the idea that people are stupid pawns of the big guys people have the ability to make everyday decisions regarding the oppression of themselves and others available to all is the choice to work to overthrow imperialism but that choice is a lot less attractive to decadent amerika in the end truman chooses the uncertainty of the violent and deceptive real world over a continued existence within the equally deceptive but safe life on the decision is presented as the ultimate answer to alienation individual choice to subjectively define reality is framed as the greatest subversion to the controlled interactions in amerikan society although individual ability to experience life without the fear of repression is a good ideal for the future this model for ending oppression is not in the interests of the international proletariat instead it pretends that each individual can escape from group power relations that exist innately within an unequal world mim says that amerikans wishing to end oppression for good have to commit class nation and gender suicide in order to unite with the international proletariat against oppression escaping within the myth of supreme individuality only ignores the fact that people benefit and are oppressed as groupsbrings the role of the media to light but insists on upholding imperialist ideals especially the one that says most people are basically stupid and weak  though they like individual heroes who stand up for themselves without challenging the system but the film like most of hollywood is not attacking or even mentioning the destructive forces of u imperialism the only lipservice given to progressive organizing is when the free truman movement is said to be rallying against trumans oppression and thats a singleissue movement around liberating one personfighting imperialist media is about creating an independent media aimed at fighting the principle oppressive force in the world u imperialism individual stories can be inspirational but if we made the movie it would have also featured a real revolutionary movement against the imperialist power structure and its media not just the noble story of one man who decides not to play along anymore,black_comedy
this is jim carrey like youve never seen before a very good satire of media ruthlessness,black_comedy
is a television show about the real life of truman burbank who has lived his entire life in a giant soundstage and who has no idea that his life has been broadcast to the world since his birth clearly this is not a realist film but if the production of something like were possible literally and legally this is probably about what it would look like however given the relatively exciting reality of everyday life exactly what the movies are there to help us escape from  i doubt that the show would be quite so widely followed or that it would have such an obsessive fan base this is a very challenging type of movie to make and the effectiveness of it reflects the skill of the films creators as was the case with the back to the future series all of the obvious problems with such a concept are dealt with and the ways that they are solved are explained in the film you have people trying to let truman know that his whole life is televised you have his deathly fear of water stemming from his fathers drowning and explaining his failure to leave his happy home even once during his entire life  and you have things like truman hearing people on his car radio as they follow his every move lights falling from the ceiling of the soundstage etc all of the close calls that you would expect to happen when keeping someone unknowingly trapped in a confined space are presented and when truman starts to catch on to the whole thing the movie really takes off and starts getting really exciting allows jim carrey to engage in several different kinds of acting even although briefly the goofy comedy that he is best known for but here he introduces a new kind of comedic acting at least new for himself in which he goes along with strange things and pretends not to be weirded out such as when his wife shows him what she bought at the supermarket explaining all of its qualities exactly like a tv commercial wow thats amazing which is intentional because the product placement is the only way to have any kind of commercial in which runs 24 hours a day this is tied in with his suspicions about what is really going on when it happens one time in the kitchen of his home and his wife is talking like a commercial again this time truman comes out and finally speaks what has been on his mind for so long in a bit of hilarious dialogue that is very effective in the nearthriller story that follows what the hell are you talking about who are you talking towhen truman seems to lose it and attack his wife she screams do something and trumans suspicions are confirmed this is a significant scene because not only is jim carrey not giving us goofball comedy but he actually appears menacing which is totally unexpected given his iconography laura linney plays the role of his intolerably tolerable wife with the incessant smile and ed harris fills in the role of the producer of in an uncharacteristic but very effective performance this film is a great example of how an impossible story can be made to work and be fun peter weir lends his direction skills to this unique story and with great success,black_comedy
i must say right off the bat that i aboslutely loved this movie  jim carrey while not at his funniest was at his best as an actor  i was quite a stretch from his usuall character the dumbo the psycho etc but he certainly pulled it off  the directing cameras and music was wonderful and they brought me into the movie  i loved the acting by all preformers especially carrey and harris  the plot and script were fantastic showing depth in characters and their relationships with each other  this movie has it all comedy tragedy drama action suspense  and there was no nudity sexuality drugs and barely any swaring  this is a great movie for people of all ages but little kids may not understand some of the thematic elements,black_comedy
this is the best movie i have ever seen only peter weir could have made it and he made it look brilliant peter weir has made many movies in the past where his characters question the system fight conformity or deny the way people accept things in the worldin this movie truman denies the entire universe where he lives he understands it is limited and fake and in the end he moves beyond the fake horizon that has been created to keep him imprisoned christof in the movie represents a fake god in fact the movie questions the entire concept of a personal god that manipulates the universe from above if such god exists then he is cruel and sick like christof in the movie but can god be understood by the human mind a lot can be said about this picture i enjoyed the acting direction and most of all its score kudos to peter weir for delivering this masterpiece,black_comedy
it is actually a surprise to me that jim carrey could perform so well i have missed both man on the moon and  when released missed on purpose actually   after a friend of mine dragged me into a theater to watch dumb and dumber well you know the feeling  i couldnt bear to watch this guy again  i was wrong oh i was wrong i rented the film on video mostly because of the director  peter weir has never been one of my favorites but surely the man knows how to make a good film well actually after watching peter weir is just a step away of becoming one of my favorites it is a brilliant film  great concept intelligent script great performances  and the greatest of them  surprise  jim carreys truman astounding  how a man can do this to himself  i mean acting as the dumb or the dumber and ace ventura etc and then unfolding a unique talent not only once but twice  man on the moon is another strong recommendation if you havent seen this film do it now  it is worth a lot more than the 103 minutes of your time it is asking a whole lot more,black_comedy
i absolutely loved this movie from the first time i saw it  now i hadnt seen it in a while and i just watched it tonight  i love it even morei might as well mention an interesting phenominon regarding  i know a lot of people who say they dont like this movie even though theyve never even seen it  thats just rediculous  now i understand it might have been a little ahead of its time a few years ago today however i think we can all agree its become a great deal more relevant,black_comedy
i saw in the theatre and in cable i thought i was going to find a movie like other jim carrey movies with a great deal of laughter but lacking plot deepness in there is more a true question of the real existance of our world and it raises questions such as are we really seen like truman was still i feel that jim carrey is too much of a comedy actor to make a drama most critics believed that this was going to be another ace ventura yet this movie lacked almost all of the carrey bag of jokes so it was a dissappointment to most jim carrey diehard fans the movie could have gone farther if there was another actor,black_comedy
how great to see a film that can appeal to all ages without appearing overly slushyyou really feel emotion for truman and the other characters in the film which is only added to by an excellent soundtrack provided by burkhard dallwitza tru sorry mustsee,black_comedy
this is the first jim carrey film where he actually diverged from his industrystandard role there were enough carreyisms to be mildly annoying but not enough to ruin a decent film the plot was really wellconstructed the acting was really quite good especially trumans wife and best friend and ed harris brilliant job as the shows creator and i really liked the set effects that were usedespecially the errors that popped up now and then the ending was overdone dont look now its hollywood but ignoring the last 20 minutes or so it was a well done film even if it did star carrey cant well be perfect can it 710,black_comedy
is damn good  i can agree with that  the whole idea of it is excellent completely original brilliant writing and fabulous actors jim carrey is one of my favourites  i loved him in the mask and as ace ventura of course  but to be honest i prefer him in comedies  is a lighthearted film  it isnt exactly serious  but jim is one of those rare people with the incredible art of being able to make anyone laugh  he should use his talent,black_comedy
review  out of rocks it is by far jim carreys best drama so far the movie takes a look at our obsession with tv and would work even better now in 2001 because of the reality show trend the movie somehow manages to be weird original funny and disturbing all at the same time however if you havent seen it be warned when i saw it the first time i didnt have a happy feeling however after watching it many times i really liked it the story goes like this truman burbank jim carrey is an ordinary guy with an ordinary house and an ordinary wifeor so he thinks but hes actually the subject of the biggest most controversial reality show of all time his world is controlled by the godlike christof a brilliant ed harris who runs trumans world from the moon meanwhile truman wants to travel and go to fiji and find a girl who he fell in love with in high school but was taken off the show because she was determined to tell truman of what was really going on all through the movie he grows more and more suspicious of his surroundings wondering is this all real jim carrey who once made his butt talk really shows that he has come a long long way from doing a slapstick kung fu routine in dumb  dumber and ed harrishe really makes you hate and love his character who has locked truman up in a prison and videoed him for his own profit truman is really the only likeable character in the movie because everyone involved with the show except him and sylvia are all the meanest kind of criminal an emotional criminal everyone from his wife to his own mother has falsely loved him and are manipulating him for their own profit but the strange thing isthey are truly horrible people but the actors who play them make them very likeable is a very uncomfortable experience yet it is extremely great,black_comedy
wonderful imaginative film by weir which focuses on truman carrey a man who has unknowingly lived his entire life as the star of a television show the film covers his selfrealization and delves most creatively into the religious parallels of his life and ours  carrey and supporting cast are excellent  weir shows a new creative style of filmmaking,black_comedy
may contain a little spoileron the air  unaware truman burbank played by jim carrey  is the star of a tvshow but he doesnt know it hes married hes got a good job everythings fine until the day some strange things happen sylvia natasha mc elhone  a former actress of the show and trumans secret love  tries to warn him he wants to find out whats going on is the story of a man who tries to break out of his life hes been betrayed for a whole lifetime betrayed by actors who pretended they were his friends that was the point that moved me most how far can tv go it seems that there are almost no limits in these days truman had no private life he was a public man until the day he found out the truth christof ed harris trumans spiritual father and the creator of the show said its not the show that is mad its the real world outside that is mad  truman lived in a save world where nothing could happen to him  i could really feel christofs pain  when truman leaves the show in the ending it looked like a child that tries to grow up and wants to stand on his own feet like a child that leaves his father  peter weir the director of dead poets society amazes me ever and ever again his movies are so uncommercial and unamerican hes australian that its a miracle theyre mostly successful but also jim carrey is a true gift he shows that he can be a real characteractor its a shame that this movie was ignored at the academy awards 1999 is a true masterpiece poetic funny and touching,black_comedy
it is the great picture i love it it is the best film of the century ok,black_comedy
1010this film is an objective bold original masterpiece housing jim carreys best performance and peter weirs finest work of art i consider this to be one of the greatest films of all timepeter weir is undoubtedly the best director australia gave birth to i found out that andrew niccol the writer is a new zealander not long after funny that hollywood would consider such a biting project also the fact that it is poetic not too long superbly written and containing elements of film craftsmanship that i have never seen used to such brilliant effect why would hollywood consider such a project proabably because jim carrey showed interestthe whole experience is a detached one because it seems as though we are watching an assemblage of footage gathered up from shots of itself along with interview footage and just general flyonthewall stuff looking back at the profound originality of the concept i never suspected someone would want to use the idea presented in the film as the basis for an actual tv show but boy did i underestimate the gullibility of general audiencesthis can now be looked at as a satirical masterpiece because of all the stupid flyonthewall shows we see on tv now it truly is a statement on the influence of the media etc after seeing this movie i was appalled at myself for being drawn into the world of tv now after being there for that long i pat myself on the back for making better observationsthis is the ultimate story of a man trapped by the influence of pop culture and an addictive source it is subjective from the music and nothing else i always believe music to be the anchor for everything in a movie and the sparingly used soapie music in this is superb what a beautiful filmonce again 1010,black_comedy
this film is a satire in the highest degree in no way is it an american classic  it tears the american dream to pieces careys perfect wife perfect home job and life all fall apart in minutes this film stands next to orwells nineteeneighty four and huxleys brave new world in its world view this film is sinister it will leave you feeling monitored and paranoid if you think about it properly the premise that your world could be entirely manufactured and that your every move could be being watched intently by thousands upon thousands of people big brother anyone genuinely scares me the film also manages to strike at the concepts of advertising  the scenes which involve this with the two guys pinning carey to a billboard are hilarious and product placement and places it more in line with the anticapitalist anticonsumer society message which flows from both american beauty and fight club all in all it is a great movie and is very moving with an excellent performance from carey,black_comedy
is a pretty good flick better than the previews suggest unless youre a fan of careys but it certainly doesnt live up to all the hype  the second half is better than the first half,black_comedy
i think this is one of the greatest movies ive ever seen and ill tell you whythe argument is about a guy truman jim carrey that lives a simple life with no surprises he grew married works every day thats it just common and anonymous life like any other but what his life definitely is not is anonymous as the whole world watch every step he makes every blink every word every snort his whole world is a tv set built just to give scenery to his life that means he lives in some kind of show being the only actor who does not perform he really lives the other ones are part of the set a huge one the purpose of this is to make a unique and completely naive show about a persons life some kind of media true show  experiment at one point he became suspicious and tried to run beyond the scenes would he make itthere is not so much comedy in this picture at least not when a take a reflective angle on it yeah there are some scenes here and there and all throughout the movie wanders the sense of irony and ridicule still the drama performs since the beginningi always demand a good movie for show me the reality in the day by day and some perspective in a world that very often seems too shallow to worth analyze it reality and perspective ive found them both hereunder the argument original itself there are two major themes that began to develop the first of it is the reality and solidness of the world we live the other one is the fatherhood and lingering all around a third tune in this melody the desirereality how you define reality is reality what you touch you smell and especially what you see do the relations with the other human beings define reality in truman s case the reality is a fake because he lives in a fake scenery in a fake city with hundreds of fake persons all actors that perform all the time but live not life at all at least at the stage of course but the point is doesnt does happen in a lighter degree in everybodys life because in one hand we see what the tv and internet shows we trust that as the source of information they shape our vision of things the media are ok for the show the big entertainment show however can they be reliable to define reality on the other hand how honest about our feelings and thoughts are we in our normal lives how much of what we are we show to colleagues at work or fellow students or friends for that matter or even our couples how many times do we split appart whats happening inside and outside half and half even less than that may be so if we define reality through our senses and relations and those are not fully trustable how can we know in what world are we living in and that question remains all over the filmwhat made truman discover the truth that is that he was being cheated well he started to watch carefully around and began to question and test at some point he started to do so not because he was mistrustful curious or just stupid he started to search because he couldnt believe he would not be able to live his dream to accomplish his wishes which were not other than to meet a girl his girl sylvia oh yeah truman has his sweetheart took away from his life for the major of all sins trying to tell him the truth so his desire led him to the discovery of the truth and so this is also a movie about desire its his desired what set him free at the endfatherhood why do i see that as a major theme in the movie well truman is an orphan adopted by the company the director of the show rules so he does have a father and that is cristof he is legally and morally his father but what a father he can do with truman everything many fathers dream to be able to do with their kids he can supervise him every time he wants with countless video cameras he designs his environment he decides who he relates with even who exist in his life and manipulate truman as deep as he wants to obtain the exact results in people interaction he can take away the characters he dont like sylvia his dead father he can even order night and day in his sons world literally and all this without paying any price at all i mean a father should suffer the reactions critics and oppositions of his sons but not in cristof s case he doesnt have to suffer that because truman doesnt know his life is being ruled arranged oh what a relief make all he wants with his sons life without suffering all the nuisances and the complains without any exposition at alland at the end what a furious father had truman to face at when the knowledge came the rebellion followed how could he dare to rebel at him the master supreme power that make all decisions in his life if he dont yield truman should be punished with no remorse at all even killed if necessary and cristof had the power to kill him indeed this father is not just a father he is a god and who will prevail in the relation between this man and his personal godfather  is he just a puppet or a free mantruman reminded us no matter how it cost freedom worths it his desire took him from his golden cage to a dangerous unpredictable tough world but still a place within to be free its worth the price no doubt at all,black_comedy
this is not the usual jim carrey that you expect by watching this movie you can really tell that he is a great actor from being disgustingly funny to kinda seriousi honestly dont like the idea that you are being watched 24 hours by people you dont know and realizing that the world you know is actually the largest soundstage or so the story tells this is like edtv but much and positively betterjim carrey deserves an oscar nomination although knowing how snobs the oscars could be definitely a 10 for the cast and the movie,black_comedy
fantastic movie great acting by jim the storyline lacked depth but he made up for it with fantastic natural acting no loudmouthed comedy this simply great a must see for all,black_comedy
everyone comments on how well jim carrey performs in the movie but they are right on  i never liked any of his slapstick comedies except his sketches on in living color but i wanted to see this film because it seemed to be similar to the themes in 1984 by george orwell it does have that orwellian style but it does do one thing that 1984 didntleft the audience with hope  i would proclaim this to be a great american film that ranks up there with the shawshank redemption the godfather and citizen kane  1010 5 stars a   jim carrey was robbedlr,black_comedy
wow this is not what i expected from a jim carrey movie  as truman burbank carrey displays an emotional depth in this movie like ive never seen him portray before  as a man whos begun to realize that his entire world is not what it seems trumans reactions to these breakdowns in his reality are priceless  the car trip in which he tries to escape the city is absolutely hilarious  carreys typical brand of slapstick and lowclass humor is thankfully absent from this movie  in its place is a movie that you feel good laughing at  and trumans scene with his father is a true work of art  dont miss this movie,black_comedy
jim carrey portrays truman burbank a man raised from birth by a corporation to star in a televised life in a town thats merely a facade surrounded by family and friends who really only regard him as a coworker  its certainly not the comedy i was expecting though it stars jim carrey and does contain some comedic moments  upon viewing i found it to be intensely dramatic and quite moving when all was said and done  the film can speak on a very literal level aptly skewering our societys obsession with voyeurism and the medias rapacious appetite for conent  or on a spiritual level with the gigantic set upon which trumans life takes place becoming an allegorical eden  while it makes some remarks about what could be considered rather dark characteristics of the modern medias role in society the film itself is far from dark and in fact contains a very uplifting message in the end jim carrey turns in an excellent dramatic performance as his character slowly comes to realize that the things happening in his life are sometimes quite odd and surreal  ed harris is good as well as the producer who watches the events in the manufactured town from on high another obvious spiritual metaphor  all of the main characters in fact do a very good job of switching between trumans acquaintances and actors simply moving on and off of a set turning off and on their apparent feelings for the main character  my favorite scenes were the ones in which truman appears at his most human doing something outside of the producers tightly scripted goings on around the small town even if you ignore all of the messages and just take the film as a simple narrative of the events in a mans life it is paced and filmed well enough that it will probably entertain most people  and while ive read a few reviews that speak poorly of the ending i thought it was perfect considering the central theme of the movie  i highly recommend it,black_comedy
simply brilliant fabulous plot which in so many movies would be poorly executed but is a work of brilliance 1010,black_comedy
this film had a subtle and powerful message about the nature of control and about the role of the media in todays world gonne madde whose life is really controlled by the media  trumans or ours it was cleverly executed with lots of nice touches and a surprisingly good performance from carrey who led his character on the voyage of dawning realisation with conviction but still managed to remain endearing and induce sympathy from the audienceprobably worth a few oscars but probably wont get them,black_comedy
i was originally reluctant to watch this film  since i thought the traileradvertisements gave away too much  when i did eventually see it i was very impressed by what wasnt in the commercials  this film has a lot of quiet charm due not only to jim carreys performance but also to the subtle serene way the story flows to its conclusion  isnt a big sprawling epic with big characters and big events but a simple movie about a man who is slowly discovering his life is a lie  theres no real suspense since the audience already knows the truth  but this is not a suspense movie it is a satire of reality  given the popularity of tv shows like survivor and the real world speaks volumes about the american obsession with voyeurism  this is the best parody of television since network,black_comedy
these comments might contain a spoiler since they refer to the plot of the movie  i first saw on its original run and was intrigued  i found myself thinking about the movie days weeks months later  i recently bought the video and have seen it many times since  i wish there had been more of the back story elements incorporated into the movie but i agree with the decision to end it before truman moves into the real world i am particularly interested in pinpointing exactly what truman believes at each point of his discovery of the truth,black_comedy
theres something special in this unique such an extraordinary movie stirs you in funny ways it makes you laugh though you might think once whether it would be better to cry jim carrey excels in his role of the decent irreproachable citizen with this movie he became a starthis film is funny but its not pure comedy the longer this movie goes on the more serious it gets the movie treats in a critical and absurd way commercialism how long is the director of the soap opera ready to go persuading people to watch their program to ruin ones life maybe so this movie could also be concerned as a satirethe director of the tvserie greatly performed by ed harris had taken away the sence of the reality from truman carrey with his delusive unreal world the issue is what does discriminate between the reality and the delutionpeter weir the director of dead poets society made this film excellent with his idiosyncratic style his critic against immorality is sharp with wellchosen cast providing credibility laura linney makes a good job in the role of trumans wife some of the sequences contains such a great irony that you cant help laughing,black_comedy
most movies nowadays have plots that have been down many times before is a new idea its a very good movie its jokes are more subtle that arent really that funny when you are watching the movie for the first time but when you think back about it you realize how absurd some of the situations werejim carrey plays truman burbank a man whose life is televised 24 hours a day  its very interesting to see carrey in a dramatic role hes actually pretty good at iteveryone should see this movie at least once to see that there is some originality left in movies today,black_comedy
a truly heartening film watching truman as he slowly discovers that he is trapped in a tv show however i felt slightly let down by the fact that once he was out that was it no follow up as to how he fares in the real world and if he ever met up with sylvia its good if a little on the short side,black_comedy
jim carrey proves that he can play more than the rubbery faced funny guy in filling out a well rounded cast is ed harris and laura linney  it was a shame that the academy didnt even nominate jim for his uncharacteristic performance but he was nominated for a golden globe though losing to that kevin spacey guy all in all is a 10 star movie and should be in everyones collection at home,black_comedy
marvellous as a jim carrey hater i found his performance in this  film to be a revelation i doubt if he will ever better this performance and will sadly return to his normal sort of role praise to peter weir for his inspired direction definitely my film of the year,black_comedy
is one of those movies that doesnt come along very often it is a great concept and it turns out wonderfully jim carrey turns in a great performance as truman burbank who spends 30 years living his life in a tv show before realizing whats going on its not what you might expect from a jim carrey movie there is no slapstick grossout humor in the film the movie is a drama that has some funny parts but it is not intended to be a comedy not that thats a bad thing in fact its a very good thing there was nothing weak about carreys part in this movie it proves that jim carrey is a truly gifted actor unlike so many others who have made their name in slapstick comedy adam sandler carrey shows that he has a wide range of talents and pulls of the dramatic acting without a hitchof course theres more to the movie that just jim carrey peter weir does a great directing job giving us the views from the cameras that watch trumans life it works very well and the supporting cast turn in great performances as well especially ed harris as christof the director of the show of course the other actors are overshadowed by carreys performance but they still do a great jobtouching might not be a word commonly associated with jim carrey films but this one is it has sad parts it has happy partsit is just a great drama the only thing it doesnt have is the slapstick humor that got jim carrey famous and i for one dont miss it see this movie it is truly great everyone involved does a great job and jim carrey establishes himself as one of the best actors of our time maybe of any timerating 1010,black_comedy
i would like to mention the fun i had watching the little details in the background such as the poster that depicts a plane being hit by lightingthe caption below it is  this could happen to youthe funny thing is of course that it happens to be hanging on the wall inside a travel agency,black_comedy
is a wonderfully created movie that tells a great story with a great moral it truly is a wonderful concept for a movie and the cast is excellent i think this movie really changed jims career for the better so he will now take more difficult roles and he proved that he can handle them  i found this movie to be very entertaining and exceptional  i can easily say this has got to be one of the most original movies i have ever seenthanks,black_comedy
this was the only movie ive ever seen in my entire life that has left me breathless  jims performance was perfect  the rest of the actors perfect  i can say so much about this movie but i will spare all who is reading this  if youre having second thoughts about seeing this movie  stop now  is worth an hour or so of your time  this movie is easily 10 big old stars out of 10,black_comedy
i admire this film most for its originality its a comment on our times without being overlysatirical it reflects who we are and what direction our media is going in without cynicism  andrew niccols idea is a creative and viable one in todays world and peter weir wonderfully directs using interesting camera angles  and of course jim carrey is phenomenal as truman burbankcomedic dramatic wonderful  i hope he does more films like this  this shows he can handle serious movies as well yet still be lighthearted at times  her certainly deserved and oscar in my opinion for his performance  please see this movie and above allthink about who we are and what we are doing with our media,black_comedy
thats all i can say its way cool i loved it bought it watched it again watched it with others watched it some more well nobody can be told what is you have to see it for yourselfwell what r u waiting for go see it,black_comedy
i would suggest that this film is beautiful carreys performance the sets the direction the music and the plot all exist with a certain kind of beauty truman is the everyman a trueman that we all hope we would be the innocent while everyone else is in on the sinister secret this film hopes that decency prevails and is a rarity within the cynicism of modern filmmaking i am grateful that this film was made we should learn from it if i dont see ya,black_comedy
i went yesterday to see and i was surprised to see jim carrey in a serious role and more surprised to see that he is indeed a good actor is an excelent movie very intelligent and very  well directed by peter weir ed harris in his role of tv producer is great really scary to see what media can do i really enjoy this movie and i think that is going to be one of this years nominees at the academy awards,black_comedy
a really good movie can be just as interesting for what it does not say seems to be in the nottoodistant future nothing is said about the way people live but we get the impression its not pretty maybe there is a restrictive government or total corporate control in any case peoples lives are pointless and trumans life becomes an idealized substitute for their ownunfairly trashed by the academy is both a wellacted and compelling story and a brilliant satire with something to say jim carrey plays a man whose entire life is defined by outside forcesbut is it so different for any of us we all tend to become those labels that society has given us furthermore it is a very straightforward jab at our current tendency toward voyeurism when celebrity gossip passes for news when we live vicariously through the wannabe exhibitionists on real world when viewers treat a televised police chase as if it were a thermonuclear war cant be far away,black_comedy
without question the concept of this movie is brilliant  everyone does well i particularly found trumans wife a riot and the last line in the movie had me laughing for a long timegreat comment on voyeurism media manipulation and consumerismrating 8 out of 10,black_comedy
very good movie but  i felt cheated by the ending  warning spoilers ahead  it would have been far more interesting if it had gone somewhere and shown what happened next  i was eager to see what was going to happen but then it just ended  there was such potential there but instead were just left with a pretty thin plot not much more interesting or significant than the twilight zone episode it was based on  oh well  i thought jim carrey did a good job  also i loved the soundtrack,black_comedy
is an exceptional piece of cinema it is mainly a media satire with beautiful subtle surreal touches  notice how truman lives in a 50s world of gadgets but it also has a strong human element without ever sinking into sentementaliy  this human element is due  to carrey who against odds has turned in a terrific performance here  definitely oscar standardthe director peter weir who i have always thought was talented but not top league with scorsese kubrick etc has made a film exceeding anything we have seen for a long time from anybody this film has got to go down as one of  if not the very best movie of the decade it may sound like im over hyping but if there is a wrong note in this film then i fail to see it,black_comedy
is definitely the best movie of 1998 and one of the best movies in the past ten years  the plot in unique and original and the acting is superb  jim carrey should have been nominated for an oscar  it makes you laugh it makes you cry it makes you think  i loved it,black_comedy
i really do like this film though im telling you if youre expecting another jumpupanddown screaminglaughter movie then this is not it truman show does have its funny laughs but the humour in it seems to be more bitter and serious in a way if you consider humour serious did surprise me when i saw it it wasnt a cheaplaugh movie with ridiculous gags though the story line does sound silly and can certainly most easily be done with the crazy kookoo styles of other jim carrey movies or any other big comedian i really do like this film and the way it stands out in a genre all on its own as you watch it you really begin to feel angry for the injustice for truman as he goes about his regular life but can also understand the reason all the rest of the world is so engrossed with him you can even understand christoffs relentless obsession and greed towards his work its a great story of how humanitys passion for money entertainment and technology won over compassion and guilt how everyone else seemed completely willing to betray and manipulate his life and surroundings for the sake of tv kinda makes you think of a puppet on strings who doesnt know the strings are there is a great film and youll be rooting for truman the whole way,black_comedy
this movie proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that jim carrey can be taken seriously as a dramatic actor i was very disappointed that he was snubbed by the academy awards for this performance ed harris also performed extremely wellfor his portrayal of truman show creator christof what is so captivating is that this movie is so originaland so well conceived peter weir is magical with his direction an american masterpieceshould not be missed by anybody its funnytouchingand simply incredible     out of ,black_comedy
the only word to describe is brilliant it is very original inventive and very entertaining this is one of the very best films of 1998 and yet it was not even nominated for best picture this is by far jim carreys best movie and it was a real shame that he did not get nominated i highly recomend this film,black_comedy
was one of the true masterpieces to come out of the late 1990s  one contributing factor being the dynamic performance by jim carrey proving to his critics that hes not just a rubberfaced goon but despite carreys breakthrough the film stands on its own as something truly unique  the script by andrew niccol beautifully satirizes our television and media dominated era incredibly being cynical and heartwarming at the same time  the viewer is allowed to observe the ridiculous position carreys truman burbank is put in and at the same time care for the man much like his millions of adoring cattle  while laughing at the ignorance of the apathetic world around truman one can not help but be fascinated by his story  but the script is not the only genius peter weirs stylishly executes  the story at a rapid pace cramming so much into the film and at the same time creating an entertaining and hypnotic movie  the camera positions switch back and forth from an directorial standpoint to the hidden cameras all over trumans world giving a multitude of perspectives and ultimately creating an amalgam of emotions   walks the fine line between comedy and drama even surpassing the typical dramedy designing a world all its own perfectly capturing the bizarre place truman is stuck in,black_comedy
it is a rare treat to see such a movie come out of the pit of hollywoods stomach  i have never sat inside a movie theater and been so involved with the life of truman  watching the man slowly unravel the world around him that is not really there was like watching movie magic fully come alive for once i wasnt awed by a movies special effects or it cheap pathetic patos it tries to drivel out at us but i was more interested in this beautifully told fable made ready for the nineties  peter weir is a genius and i cannot wait for this film to make him more recognized as just that he knows how to tell a story and all the while hold jim carrey under restraint,black_comedy
i believe that in the future when the 90s are looked back upon will be seen as one of its truly representative films not only for its high quality but for its unerring evocation of one of the most prominent themes of our times the out of control nature of the media and its invasion of our personal lives think about how many movies over this past decade have used this theme as a jumping off point natural born killers mad city wag the dog to die for the cable guy quiz show edtv   i could go on but you get the idea towers over all these films because instead of being a polemic it casts its story in the form of a fable youre free to buy whats happening as real or simply metaphorical and the story works equally well either way because theres no direct reference to any current media images no mtv or cnn or jay leno monologues about truman and his life the story exists outside of time  it could take place either in the future a fictionalized present or an imagined past its never made clear and it doesnt matter by not trying to be up to the minute succeeds in being timelesshowever that is only one of its many successes the story manages to be involving on the levels of drama and comedy simultaneously trumans dilemma is always achingly real to him and yet as spectators we cant help but see how funny are the preposterous ways in which the situation is kept going the posters in the travel agency for example or the teacher telling truman youre too late everythings been discovered already to be sure its a sinister humor one that chills at the same time it amuses it reminded me at times of the coldness and bemused misanthropy pervading such kubrick films as lolita dr strangelove and 2001 and yet amazingly at the same time it also had  through truman  a hopefulness and a wonderment that was reminiscent of the very best of spielberg now i cant think of two directors who are more different from one another and by evoking both the film shows an almost unparalleled range and visionid like to say jim carrey was a surprise here but in fact he wasnt not to me anyway from the time i saw him in the mask in his stanley ipkiss scenes i always suspected he had a role like this in him hes effective and believable in a more toneddown part although i believe that the role is such a gem  and so assured of audience sympathy  that nearly any actor could have played it and been equally effective the true star here is the director peter weir who after this and fearless must now be considered in the genius category not only does he create a compelling and totally believable world but he uses camera angles in a sly and totally original way to subtly indicate to the audience the depth of surveillance involved in trumans world and he comes up with a cornucopia of unforgettable images all slightly surreal and menacing while at the same time containing a strange and gripping beauty the sunset scene where the sun and moon hang next to each other in the sky the nighttime image of all the actors on the set arm in arm searching for truman with guard dogs and flashlights definite shades of invasion of the body snatchers the final scene of truman at the ends of the earth seemingly walking on the water an image magritte or dali would have been proud to have painted and perhaps most memorably the supremely surprising yet totally brilliant moment when the moon metamorphisizes  into a giant searchlight even out of context these scenes have a stunning visual power and add immensely to the films overall subject and themebut even if youre not in the mood for a serious message or a meditation upon the popular media and its role in our lives its possible to enjoy on just the most basic level of an interesting story well told its a quest film but because of the way its set up and its sly humor it can also be enjoyed as a parody of a quest film after all its only a tv show its major themes can be taken as a parody of a movie that would like to have major themes the film achieves this dual effect significant and yet not significant because of the way it refracts everything through the television lens  which as we all know trivializes every subject it encounters yes even a mans quest to discover the meaning of his life and start entirely anew the very final shot of the movie which some people complain is too glib and abrupt is actually perfect because it emphasizes this point with such deadly satirical forceentertaining thought provoking eerie sad triumphant  just about the most complete movie experience you could ever have definitely one of the classics not only of our time but of all time,black_comedy
my only gripe is the product placement gag intended to be surreal but in fact prosaic  as well as silly  surely the evil genius behind would have come up with a more creative source of fundingbut were talking about what thirty seconds of footage  apart from this is a film so finely crafted it sings  lovely to look at and intelligent as well  one of the two peaks of science fiction cinema of the 1990s the other was twelve monkeys but this rather understates the case  jim carrey was inspired casting  i dont care whether hes technically speaking a good actor or not  he might as well be since hes perfect as the hothouseproduced truman burbank who doesnt know hes performing in front of a huge audience but whos unconsciously adopted one or two mannerisms of someone who doesamazingly some critics have complained about the end motivated perhaps by the vague feeling that no symphony should ever end on a sweet major chord  honestly  some people wouldnt know a good story if it fell out of the sky and hit them  the entire film was concerned with the inside of trumans dome  we were told of course that there was an outside world as there must be and we even saw bits of it  but only those bits that were directly connected to the inside of the dome  when truman finally after a good story dammit emerges from his egg the story simply must end theres no other way to end it  i hope all those people who wanted to know how truman will cope with the outside world get their wish  i hope theres a twee tiresome mindnumbingly tedious sequel which tells you everything you want to know  serve you right  you can watch that ill watch the breathtaking original again,black_comedy
peter weir has done a lot of  good movies but i think this movie is one top of his carrier this is an original unusual but well done movie from its start to the end the plot and the music go well together peter weir was very brave when he gave a dramatic role to jim carrey but it was worth this is the only one movie in which i can watch jim carrey without he makes me angry moreover i very like him in this movie he is lovely smart in this film and does a good job ed harris is also very good i wished that this film would get a nomination for oscar but it didnt perhaps this is a very unusual film,black_comedy
truman show belongs to a breed of movies that are different imaginative and funny its most famous cousin forrest gump was just as great to watchnever liked jim carrey much i just thought of him as an overrated clown whose movies were only rented and enjoyed by boyfriends who actually thought cable guy would be entertaining for his girlfriend too but he is perfect as truman the ultimate tvseries hero i dont think anyone could have played the role betterthe setup is fantastic the idea soars high and will be hard to duplicate and i hope we will be spared any sequels in any event the originality and sense of wonder that prevails here is hard to achieve  but truman show really makes itby the way i think ed harris should be given greater roles hes awesome,black_comedy
truman show was one of those films that i could identify myself with actually i have thought of a similar plot in my head with andrew niccols brilliant screenplayi love that guyeven his gattaca i actually thought ofim not jokinganyway if you look at the film it is just perfect and ingenious to the little nitty gritty things  after you watch it the first time watch it again and look for peter weirs incredible attention to its background details in terms of the extras and the sets  its incredible,black_comedy
i am not sure how many of us can really appreciate the thought of how close we actually are to a truman show in the netherlands there are a number of people locked into a large apartment which actually is a studio the last one to remain in there receives a certain amount of money the whole studio is full of tiny cameras even in the bathrooms to have at least a small amount of privacy those people hung up a towel in the shower at an angle where no camera can watch this show is called the big brother show  think about itpeter weir did some fine directing here and even carrey goes beyond what we know from him the sarcasm in it all could have been taken even a notch further but the overall outcome is still remarkable a definite nottobemissed movie,black_comedy
i cannot understand those reviewers who wrote its a good comedy and you will have a lot of laughs i dont remember myself laughing not even once i consider though this film one of the best ive ever seen an excellent idea with excellent scenario i guess both go to peter weir and an excellent performance by the protagonist truman once again the academy ridiculed themselves by not giving the oscar to jim carrey it is one of those movies i call a cinematic experience the perennial story of the fight for freedom told in a truly original way if you think you are left unsatisfied with the end you are potential viewers of the fictional truman show but the most annoying scene for me was the very last where the two cops take the remote and change the channel to find something else at their faces i recognized everyone of us we search for the next excitement forgetting instantly all the past enough with the analysis just go and see it its a piece of gold even if its too slow in the beginning and too predictable in the end,black_comedy
i saw truman show four times and bought the video  no im not a carrey fan  though when i heard he was going to be in truman show i watched the mask and knew why weir had agreed to direct him  in repose he has exactly the face that weir seems to look for  anyway i liked him in thisim no expert on technical matters but the film looked great  acting has to be bad for me to notice nothing here was that bad  ed harris played the obsessed director christof brilliantly  a hypnotists voice and an illusionists hands  the music was just right  how many people spotted the ringin in the soundtrack polish composer kilars the preaching of father kolbe and how its used  for anyone who doesnt know maximilian kolbe was a polish franciscan priest who died in auschwitz in the place of another prisoner  but what hooked me was the story   truman show reminded me of g k chesterton   not the father brown stories but the theological polemics and overthetop fantasies  surface glitter and intellectual wit concealing an emotional and spiritual double whammyyes this film is a metaphor but subtler than it seems   christof isnt anything like the biblical god but hes a pretty close image of the thing the new testament calls the god of this world prince of the power of the air father of lies and a murderer from the beginning  truman is all of us a twentieth century boy modern postmodern man reared inside the closed universe of the rational materialists an unreal city a godfree zone where man is god and material happiness is the most we are allowed to hope for  but what happens if we fall in love with someone who tells us its all a big lie  get out of herecome and find me what if its an open universe after all  open  but not empty   the whole film works brilliantly as a pilgrims progress for the heirs of the enlightenment,black_comedy
i expected this movie to be a light comedy comedy it was but light never at the end i had to sit still for about ten minutes to take it all in has one of the best endings that i have ever seen it was dramatic creative and simply amazing i loved it,black_comedy
what makes such an interesting movie  well you can say that its cast director or even the concept of the story are original and interesting i think that the movie go beyond all that for a matter of fact what we have here is the whole american idea of life in the tv age as we look at truman and watching over his life one cant help wandering to himself if someone is watching him maybe our life to are being filmed and broadcast all over the world the whole idea here is to make us see and understand the next step in tv broadcasting and why not  if we can watch on our tv all kind of natural disaster and human suffering why cant we watch a real life the first part of the movie is excellent as we are discovering truman life and the second part when truman himself discovered is even better go and see,black_comedy
at first when i watched i did not know what the story was about because i did not read the short summary on the cover so i was quite amazed when truman found out that the whole city around him was just a huge set and the people around him were hollywood actors and actresses after the movie i was really impressed because truman was actually living his whole life in a giant prison without knowing it this movie is so different from other movies that it is really a pleasure to watch it there is nothing i would have made different,black_comedy
this was a great movie and i liked jim carrey performance especially it was a bit different for him yet he was a good fit natasha mcelhone was excellent in her role and the end was pretty emotional while being completely odd at the same time we loved itif you like movies that are offbeat and yet have some good belly laughs and of course you like jim carrey this is a goodie,black_comedy
i dont know which is worse  the movie itself or the fact that people actually like iti never really liked jim carrey anyway and this movie did not make him any more appealing to meits funny how people try to find a philosophy or a message or a deeper meaning in every other movie that comes along  are we really getting that desperate  someone will be saying that tom and jerry projects the continual stuggle between good and evil nextcan we just have some decent entertainment please without trying to be too clever,black_comedy
is the years best movie and the best film of the decade that says alot for being in the same decade as schindlers list and boogie nights the mass popularity of the show is a metaphor  for our narcotic obsession with televisiontrumans revolt against technology is a great fable a mythic ode to individuality that uses the oppressors own weapons against them,black_comedy
warning this comment deals with the ending of so if you havent seen it yet dont read this commentit seems that many viewers dislike the ending because it does not show us what happens to truman in the outside world also viewers tend to criticize the fact that the movie does not reveal the emotions of truman as he finds out the truthon the contrary i believe that  although the movie contains certain flaws  the ending is perfect by stopping as truman leaves the set where the tvshow is recorded the film brings across the simple and crucial point that as soon as truman walks through the door he escapes the cameras thus whatever happens to truman after he walks through the door is no longer recorded by cameras and remains private to him whatever happens afterwards is no longer shared with millions of tvviewers and indeed movieviewersfor similar reasons the movie does not show us the emotions of truman as he finds out the truth just as the cameras cannot follow truman as he walks off the set they cannot record his private thoughts and emotions indeed truman himself explains to the director of the tvshow that he cannot know what truman feels because he is unable to look inside his head truman does not want to share his emotions with the rest of the world therefore he turns his back to the camera at this point and neither the tv nor the movieviewer get to see his private emotional reactionin conclusion it seems ironic to me that the ending of the movie has been criticised those who want to know what happens to truman as he leaves the set of the tvshow and want to know what his emotional reaction is are implicitly saying that truman should not be allowed to escape the cameras they want the movie or in other words the tvshow to continue that is those of you who criticise the ending of are unknowingly endorsing the fictional tv show itselfjust take a minute to think about that,black_comedy
someone suggested to me that this movie might have been far far more successful if it had been differently structured imagine if like truman the audience hadnt known until the end that truman was in a tv show  it might have given the movie a certain sense of pathos and let the audience identify a lot more with truman  as it was i think that too much was given away too soonknowing that it was a tv show in advance made it harder to identify with trumans dilemma  it made all the shows action seem stilted the reintroduction of his father obvious and subplot with the mysterious redhead unconvincing  even the social satire came off as overwrought  as such was not the great movie i was hoping for when i went to it  it had great potential and squandered it so consider this my couldhavebeenbetter pitch,black_comedy
i have been a fan of jim carreys for a while now since seeing the mask i have also seen some of his other films such as ace ventura pet detective and when nature calls dumb and dumber and once bitten in as in liar liar he shows a different style of acting which is extremely good  he shows that he can actually be serious i think this was a very challenging role for him because he has done so many comedy roles in the past he should maybe make more movies like this one although comedy is really his scene but is a real winner for me the story line is fantastic and the acting was really well done i give it 9 out of 10,black_comedy
is one of my favorite movies before watching it i wasnt very excited even expecting a great film in fact i decided to watch it when i realized that all magazines were saying it was incredible beautiful touching  and i really found iti thought the movie was more comedy than drama its a multigenre movie its very hard to tell i loved the scenes where they showed  how trumans life could be and were controlled one spotlight falling from the sky all the days were sunny the same people doing the same thing every day and the most amazing when christof ed harris trying to find truman makes the sun rise in 2 seconds at midnight i have to say that i was a bit afraid of jim carrey how can a movie with jim carrey as the main character be a drama or even be good but this time his grimaces didnt affect the movie as nothing is perfect in the world there are some small problems in i think the theme could be more explored by the director peter weir the end that some people said was revolting didnt look so strange to me but i agree that they should have shown what happened to truman after his decision ok truman is free and after it in summary you must see this movie its almost perfect 910,black_comedy
saw the film on a plane on the way back from corfu not the ideal place to watch the film and missed the ending so impressed by the film i shall certainly watch it again if you havent heard anything about the film then watch it before you do otherwise trailers will spoil the plot,black_comedy
could have been one of the best films of the 90s if there wasnt a small problem theres something missing on it ive tried to discover what it is but i couldntwe are not used to see films like so some people can think it is quite confuse but i dont think so above all it is an adult fable about a mans life it talks about many serious and complex subjects with sweetnessthe acting in the film is great jim carrey redeemed himself i dont think he deserved the oscar but i recognize he has a very good performance in the film ed harris has the best performance of his life as christof and he deserved the oscar more than james coburn although i think billy bob thornton was also superb in a simple plan and there is natasha mcelhone trumans great love in the story and we have to pay attention at herthe screenplay is unique but i dont know if the thing that is missing is fault of the director or the writer maybe it was no ones fault i really dont know i just think that had everything to be a masterpiece well it is almostrating 910,black_comedy
warning may contain spoiler this is one of thoughs movies where you cant really form an opinion one thing i can tell you is not to expect jim carrey to act like ace ventura fletcher reede or the mask in this movie he is not the silly funny jim carrey that weve all gotten used to in this movie he acts a lot like matthew broderick notice that this movie is not a comedy i made the mistake of assuming it was a comedy because jim carrey was in it i cant decide whether its good or bad i can say however what my experience was while i was watching it this movie started off very slowly and i was getting very board for the first 30 minutes or so i like movies that get to the point quickly and definitly takes a lot of time to really start off the story the ending disappointed me a little bit because once truman leaves the giant studio he is living in the story ends instantly i was hoping that id get to see truman step into the outside world for the first time and react to it but instead truman just walks through the door and that ends the story also once he learned the truth about his whole life being a set up the audience is never clear on his true feelings about this discovery this movie is kind of like a hilly road when it comes to interest it starts off boring gets interesting then gets boring the only reason i decided to see this movie was because i like jim carrey and i didnt have to pay to rent this film jim carrey is a very emotional actor who shows his emotions well through his facial expressions in all this movie is very different and in a way kind of strange i hope jim carreys next movie is a comedy because i think actors and actresses do best when they stick with parts they are good at jim carrey is good at making comedies so i think he should stick with that but something different every once in a while is good toomy rating 7 out of 10,black_comedy
at last something a little not completely different from the movie whorehouse that is hollywood today is such a wonderful movie it just has to be seen to be believed i have read many comments made about this and there are flaws but we dont watch movies to look out for flaws if they are obvious ones then fair enough but this film is consistent and true to itself and paints a good enough picture of a world in which one man is put on a stage without him knowing it but the true success of this film is how you cannot help but root for the guy one of my personal top qualities of a successful film you feel his pain and you just want him to get the hell outta there i dont really like christof much he is a little one dimensional and a bit too on the evil sidea bit sick but that aside there is not much else at fault i love the way we see truman as the viewers would see him all the timebecause they have cameras everywherethat is so clever anyway enough about the film  im going to watch it again right now bye,black_comedy
warning might include spoilersat first i wasnt especially interested in seeing i thought how can a movie starring jim carrey be any good after all he made the cable guy one of the worst ever movies little did i know that carrey would contribute in making one of my alltime favorite moviestruman show has one of the most nuanced and subtle scripts ive come across the story simply nails you to your seat directing is brilliant thanks to masterdirector peter weir also responsible for the stunning dead poets society here weir recreates the world in which truman burbanks lives and is being involuntarily filmed 24 hours a day peter weir actually places us there on the spot next to truman shares us trumans feelings and thoughtswe laugh as he laughs and we cry along with him towards the end of the film we sense trumans despair and hopelessness deep inside of us even though we already know all about his situation the reason for this is that weir manages to make truman represent mankind truman could be any one of usis a movie playing on many levels at once it has humor and drama it concerns our need for entertainment and reveals an increasingly shameless mediaindustry the first channel to adopt a child as well as  mans fight and struggle to break out of tediousity and distress basically   our need for freedomthere are so many details here the pin with the words how is it going to end the various ways truman is being kept at seahaven the preventive posters at the travel agency has to be seen to be believed and notice how christof falls forward at the end as if he had lost everything even his own life the very moment truman gained hisacting is flawless from the acting actors  laura linney as trumans wife and noah emmerich as his best friend marlon  to ed harris as christof along with christofs companions harris carries out a truly awesome performance he steals every scene and finally jim carrey is magnificent as truman   burbanks from the burbanks galaxy   he does everything right he is goofy when its called for and genuinely moving and emotional at other times i cant think of a better actor to portray trumans everyday lifeive seen six times now and i will buy the home video cassette and put it on my shelf this is an utter perfect movie and one of my five favorite movies of all time,black_comedy
first off i have to say that i really believe that the majority of people that didnt like this were people that were expecting ace ventura to pop up on screen  like all of a sudden jim carreys face was going to explode with laughter and he was going to break into fits of absurdity the way he did when he talked with his butt  and if that is the hang up you have with this film then i pity you because there is so much to this film that it could make you look at things a little closeris what seems to be the story of a man that has lived a make believe life  we all know what it is about and if you dont then this review is not the best one for you skip down in the imdb and there are many great reviews about what turman is in the narrative sense  i want to touch on something else and it is something that i hope other people can see as wellcan be a metaphor for anyones life especially us that dwell in wealth of the western culture  because the one question arises in this movie that doesnt let go of you is a scary one and that is  what is real   im not talking in the literal sense the way truman has it  his life is not real in the sense that he is there for everyone to view and take pleasure from  but when i ask  what is real  i mean what in our life is real  im sure that you can get a myriad of responces to that question but after seeing this movie it makes me question every single one of the answers that i can come up with  asks you to open your eyes and look around you  is what you see pleasing  do you have the white picket fence the two car garage the double income family the kids that are going to make you proud and go to college good friends a few pets an okay boss a sense of security a faithful spouse a nice car money in the retirement fund and so on  well do you  if you do is it possible to fathom that it could all be a sherade that it is all a mirage  that white picket fence could get destroyed by a tornado or vandals your two car garage could get destroyed by a fire your double income family could be reduced to nothing if one of you is caught cheating or there are budget cutbacks and someone loses a job or becomes expendable the kids may not want to go to college they may get pregnant or make someone pregnant and want to work in a hardware store for the rest of their life your friends may not like you very much and just put on an act for propriety sake in fact one of those friends may be sleeping with your wife or husband your pet may get run over by a car your boss may despise you the stockmarket could crash and all of your sense of security with it your nice car is just a machine to get you places and the retirement fund could be gone tomorrow you never know  the whole point to this is that wants us to look a little closer at what it is that is important to us  it shows and tells us in a round about way that we have become strange and demented when we prioritize the things in our life the way we do  and in a way every character in could be us  how many of us want control the way ed harris has control  how many of us are the loving wife  or husband  who is happy on the outside and stark raving mad and downright miserbable on the inside how many of us want to tell the world that something is wrong with it the way trumans one and only true love wanted to tell him  how many of us are the consumate actor when we need to be just like trumans best friend  and how many of us are truman a guy that knows something is wrong with hisher life but has no idea what or how to fix it  i think we are all like these people sometimes  and that is what makes as brilliant as it is because it is twisted but so is life  if you havent seen this film i strongly recommend that you do and if possible watch it back to back with american beauty  both have a lot to say about society in general they go about it in different ways but it is essentially the same message  its never to late to start over this is a great film and one that should be seen to be appreciated  it is a gem and deep down it wants us to look  closer  sorry to steal that catch phrase from american beauty but it applies here just as well  life is what you make of it it just takes a little work,black_comedy
this movie is surely one of the best ive ever seen at the beginning i thought it was boring but i was able to understand because i already knew a bit what it was about the best moment in the film was when they showed the trutalk theme i think this movie also should have been nominated for the academy award for best picture the one for best editing and the one for best music it probably wouldnt have won all of them but it certainly deserved the one for best screenplay  editing this movie is really fabulous and it is impossible for me to imagine how anyone cannot enjoy it,black_comedy
excellent pumping baby great humour combined with serious scenes v good scripting,black_comedy
fabulous because its one of the few movies which really give you some intellectual stimulation as well as emotional pull the viewer walks away with new thoughts about self and identity,black_comedy
to write my opinion of this movie is a very difficult task it cant be well explained in wordsso this will not be a good comment if you want a good comment see the film and let your brain do the workthe director peter wait did a great job the manuscript is well written by andrew niccol the concept of the movie is that truman burbank is the character in the worlds most seen tv show the show is called truman doesnt know that he is the main character in the show the creators of the show has created a mini world for truman to live ineverybody truman meets is actors his mother his wife and his best friend the studio is full of cameras and they plan his whole life they fix every error that occurs one day the biggest error possible occurs will they be able to fix itin my opinion jim carrey truman burbank did a great performance perhaps his best ever he is well known by his comediesace ventura 1 and 2 the cable guy the mask and dumb and dumber he is an excellent comedy actor but as mentioned he fits very well into the drama the other actors did a great performance tooif you expect a pure comedy when you sit down to see i believe you will be very disappointed this is a fantasydramathis film was absolutely genius9 of 10 stars,black_comedy
is a wonderfully scripted movie  jim carrey gives the performance of a lifetime  will have you laughing crying and cheering for truman burbank  everything about the movie is wonderful a must see for people who want to see a movie that is truly original,black_comedy
spooky profound and perhaps prophetic could the world we live in be trumans world instead of christof or his predecessor the wizard of oz could there be aliens out there running their tv show of uswe cant get out of this solar system the sun is rigged out there just as truman could never sail to fiji no human can live long enough to transverse interstellar space to alpha centuri proxima the nearest star before the gods we must have demigods in the form of those looking over us real or imagined does it make any difference and as christof says we accept the reality that is given us so we could be fooled anyway begins with a startling premise marvelously presented the script by andrew niccol is a work of art and the direction by peter weir surehanded and seamless he allows the story to unfold at a convincing pace and the fifties cum nineties tv americana feel to the seahaven sets is delightful jim carrey is perfect as truman burbank the poor sap in a fishbowl everything about his life including his wife and best friend are totally fake ed harris as the megalomanic tv artist christof is creepy enough although the scenes with him are ironically less convincing than those in trumans world i thought he came across a little too much like a mad scientist laura linny as carreys tv wifeproduct spokesperson with the ever present tv smile is wonderful and good too is his estranged girl friend natascha mcelhone with the big eyessome unanswered questions we know there is a camera in the bathroom do they switch to another shot when he is using it or does the worldwide audience watch him move his bowels and is his wife a whore as well as a tv actress or is their relationship purely platonic does the audience see them together in the bedroom does she have a life away from him weir chose not to address these questions although the premise looks a little messy when examined closely the inspired and completely apropos ending is as crisp and clean as the dot at the end of this sentencenote over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book cut to the chaise lounge or i cant believe i swallowed the remote get it at amazon,black_comedy
i must say i was a little reluctant to see the movie at first as jim carrey was the lead star  but i was surprised to see that jim has a bit more to his acting ability than his usual set of goofiness  the photography in the movie in of itself was an art form  the story and music went very well together  i must say it is most definitely a movie worth seeing if not just once then perhaps several times,black_comedy
this is the kind of movie that makes you think it is possible to just watch it as any other movie but if you are the sort of person that likes to think this movie gather a lot of philosophical questions in your mind likewhat is the meaning of lifewhy am i hereis the world around me real or just a fake and so onthat is the main purpose why i like this movieit is also fun to see jim carrey do a serious role for the first time  and i must say that i think that he did it very well 1010,black_comedy
ill admit i happen to like jim carrey and that was the main reason for me renting it out but now that ive seen it i think its one of the best movies everim not going to talk about how good it was or how well filmed it was this film was an excellent chance for jim carrey to break out of the typecast he put himself in and quite frankly this was a chance he grabbed with enthusiasmjust one gripe however the scene with him walking out the door im aware that this is supposed to be the climax of the film and i loved it as it is but i felt that the holy grail by hunters and collectors would have made this scene absolutely perfect why the first verse says it allwoke up this morning from the strangest dreami was in the biggest army the world had ever seenwe were marching as one on the road to the holy grail,black_comedy
in the jim carrey comes of age not only is he funny but i found the movie to be somewhat of a satire on the entire movie industry darkly funny strangely sad i enjoyed every momentthe plot centres on truman and his hollywood made world a world where he is the unwitting star and everyone is in on it there the entire world is witness to every moment of truman burbanks incredible life  a life carefully orchestrated by christof a movie producer driven to wrench every emotion from turman no matter the consequencelike citizen canes rosebud the shirt button how will it end is sure to become an icon of this fine movie,black_comedy
i was amazed by this film and incredibly surprised when it wasnt nominated for best picture  first theres jim carreys performance  it is a departure for him yet it seems tailor made  in my opinion it deserved an oscar nomination  ed harris and laura linney were also great  peter wiers direction is remarkable  he deserved every award he won and andrew niccols screenplay was certainly better than shakespeare in loves which won and that annoyed me to no end  a film that entertains you completely while asking how completely you should be entertained  it is a plausible idea executed brilliantly  a film i plan to watch again  rated 4 on my top ten of 1998,black_comedy
it gives me great pleasure to see people try to explain peter weirs  even here at imdb the genre is listed as fantasydramacomedyscifi  and yet is it really any of these  anyone whos seen it will probably agree with me that it is sort of all of these but not really anylet me begin by saying that truman burbank is my hero  i cant tell you why exactly except that i dont think id ever have the courage to do what he did  if you dont know what he did see the movie  truman is brilliantly played by the often unbrilliant jim carrey  hes a nice guy we like him  we like his wife laura linney  we like his best friend marlon noah emmerich  in fact we even sort of like christof ed harris the media mastermind who created trumans world and saw it fall apart think of dr frankensteins famous line  ive created a monsterevery involved in this film should be saluted  andrew niccols script is flawless peter weirs minimalist direction gives even more energy and charisma to the production etc etc etc  i could go on forever but i wont  suffice it to say that trumans journey and discovery is one of the most moving and profound ive ever found in film  who knew hollywood could still make brilliant movies out of ,black_comedy
jahoo its not often you get to see a film that touches you in the melankolic part of your heart but heres one that doesis one of my top ten movies of all time why well because its got all those elements that keeps you going fun sad and a guy in a fake worldcarreys my favorite no doubt about it rates 10 of 10 or  of ,black_comedy
in this movie jim carrey really shows that he can act its a shame that he didnt get nominated both carrey and harris are perfect for this movie but if your lookin for a fun comedy with jim carrey this isnt the movie you want,black_comedy
is a heartfelt emotional journey of a man who seeks to find a truth in his imaginary world full of mysteries  jim carrey takes a long break from the act of funniness and insincerity and shows an emotional confused man who suddenly finds the truth of it all in this movie  it is a very distinctive utopia of many worlds and wonders as we look at him through the eyes of the viewers and christofs world  its not funny its proud and happy its very well conceived and very dramatic  but i didnt really like the ending though  but it didnt take my lapse out of this imaginary film that has been a thrill to watch at,black_comedy
jim carrey gives a tour de force performance as an insurance salesman named truman burbank he is surprisingly restrained enjoyably funny and shockingly touchingitself is a shockingly touching piece of filmmaking even if you know the controversial secret of the show its still utterly heartfelt as we root for truman to find out his proper place in the world and not let anyone get in his waythe film was impressively directed by peter weir on an epic scale from an epic script by andrew niccol more importantly though this movie deserves to be seen because jim carrey gives what might be the single best performance of the year or at least a very close second to jeff bridges as the dude in the coen brothers thoroughly entertaining the big lebowski not to give away anything significant but when truman finds the wall and decides to make the exit we remain utterly still and hopeful and when the exit is made we feel the triumph of a human being rated pg 102 minutes 10 out of 10,black_comedy
jim carrey would not be on too many lists for very good actors but he is a major talent  his comedy is alternately inventive and offputting  yet here he is in a role that is original and interestinghe plays truman burbank who lives in a nice quiet town where everyone knows everyone  but little does he know he is the subject of a 24hour tv showthe screenplay is creative in inventing ways to keep truman from knowing this fact such as a fear of the ocean and in the  gradual awakening to a new reality that truman must facecarrey makes truman into a sympathetic character who is thrust into a situation that is hard to accept  everything hes ever known is staged it is a touching likable performance that is complete and true to charactered harris provides fine support as cristof the creator of opting for a lowkey approach rather than a madman performance that makes him worthy of pityandrew niccol gattacas screenplay is one of the most creative in a long time which presents intriguing questions about the nature of television privacy and how far technology should be taken  is it okay to place a person in a bubble all his life for all to see just because we can must we those questions provide for a multilayered plot that makes you thinkstrong direction from peter weir witness dead poets society,black_comedy
i need to finally say this andrew niccol has done two movies and both are on my top 3 list gattaca was amazing everything about that movie was spectacular now here comes which was written but not directed by the genius and is almost as good the story is so unique there has never been anything like it before jim carrey is exceptional peter weir who did another movie on my top 3 list dead poets society did a fantastic job directing this story of paranoia and of course the script is brilliant jim carrey should really be proud of himself for doing such a different role and to star in a dramacomedy this movie is definitely on my top 3 thats funny my top 3 movies all have something in common ethan hawke is in dead poets society and gattaca gattaca was written by andrew niccol along with and peter weir directed along with dead poets society note i do not count the star wars movies on my top 3 list because i dont count those as movies i count those as empires i am very glad that this story had very little comedy elements in it it was mostly drama and fantasy this movie is a very unique and special movie and i highly recommend it to everyone who likes unique stories just dont expect to see a jim carrey comedytype movie,black_comedy
most annoying was the feeling of clearly being part of multilayer story myself the folks in christofs world were watching truman watch tv while i was watching them and truman and the show he was watching suddenly i realized that i was in fact also being part of the chain being in story and even a bit confused where the trueman really lies a shaking reminder and study of the power and the nature of tv,black_comedy
is another one of my personal favorites  this movie will probably disappoint people if you think its an all out comedy like all of jims movies  but its not  in fact i think its way better  jim definitely shows his acting abilities as a persona other than comedy  the idea of this movie is just extraordinary  and the climax and resolution of this dramatic movie is wounderful  i gave a 10  this movie will surely give jim carrey a future in more wide variety movies besides comedy,black_comedy
this movie is destined to become an all time classicits beauty is in the simplicity of its meaning  truman comes to discover that his whole life is a lie but he must confront his fears in order to overcome the falsehood the most significant single thing is that the door at the top of the stairs is unlocked  truman was free to leavein case i dont see ya good afternoon good evening and good night,black_comedy
supposedly this was the film jim carrey needed to make that as may be but was he really the right man for the job carrey has carved a career as a rubber faced comic actor who acts at the top of his voice a lot but demands he portray what at first seems a midlife crisis but later develops into full paranoia albeit justifiedmeet truman burbank he is the future of television his show beams around the world 24 hours a day everyone loves truman people collect truman memorabilia and videos he has theme bars named after him but truman burbank does not know any of this he lives in a world populated by principal actors and extras trumans life is a carefully orchestrated soap opera controlled that is until he becomes dissatisfied with life and wants to move away from the sleepy island he calls home his repeated failure to get away arouses his suspicion that his life is not his ownthere are many faults in for instance onscreen the shows creator christophe tells us the reason truman is so popular with the audience is because his life is idyllic yet the character we meet is an insurance salesman living in fifties america no offence intended to our american cousins but it is never really explained why this irritatingly twee view of america should cross international cultural boundariesanother down side are the unsympathetic characters on display this is surely due to the fact that everyone is playing a character who is playing a character the only genuine person is truman and he is played by jim carrey and worse has led a life so mindnumbingly normal as to be almost abnormalthe good thing about is that the concept is very strong director peter weir brilliantly keeps up the twilight zonestyle paranoia and the film is very well scripted despite being generally irritating carrey is not a disaster in the role and he does encourage you to sympathise with trumanmost of the philosophy spun regarding our tv watching generation comes across as a bit hackneyed however the final scene of the movie sums up telly addicts the world over,black_comedy
marvelous film that mirrors the directorial touches of capra or sturges and the fantastical writings of billy wilder and ial diamond peter weirs film of truman burbank the unwitting star of his own real life television show where every moment of every day of his entire life has been filmed is an original slice of life catapulted by an outstanding performance by jim carrey who was snubbedyes by you oscaras truman who discovers what is happening to him and searches for the truth,black_comedy
ive only just seen this film after everyone raving about it  maybe that was the problem for me too much expectation and it fell a little flat however carrey was a revelation  ive never seen him play it straight before and he excelled himselfi liked the message that the film sent and for hollywood to come out and basically sent itself and its industry up should be applauded for bravery in my book,black_comedy
jim carrey proves to the world that he can do a whole lot more than talk out of his ass with this brilliantly astonishing performance he plays truman burbank a normal white collar suburbanite who works in real estate and leads a simple normal life however his life is anything but normal from the moment of his birth his entire life has been shown on television live and unedited to an audience around the world the island he lives on is a gigantic sound stage with close to 5000 cameras and with the great wall of china is one of two man made structures still visible from space his wife best friend the people he works with and the people he sees everyday are all just actors the most amazing thing about this innovative premise is the fact that truman is completely unaware of all of this the premise of this film is how he finds out about the reality of his life and how to escape this prisonis peter weirs finest film ever and the always excellent ed harris who plays director christof gives his best performance since glengarry glen ross jim carrey gave the best performance that i have seen in 1998 and laura linney  provided some comic relief as an over acting actress playing trumans wife as the 2 film of 1998 next to saving private ryan and one of the 10 greatest films of the 1990s ranks as one of my top 30 favorite films of all time this is a film that truly deserves a 5 star rating comedy drama romance and even suspense this film as something for everyone and is one of those rare films that has something for everyone it even has an important moral message behind it the fact that life is too sacred and precious to be entertainment for someone elsethis is one of the most uniquely original motion pictures that i have seen in a long time absolutely not to be missed by anyone,black_comedy
pretty good movie although a bit emotionally unrealistic  too bad about jim carrey as well overall its well worth seeing though,black_comedy
i think is the greatest story and movie ever told without calling itself that  who am i  who created me why am i here somethings wrong with the whole picture of my life   why do we dream  where do the dreams come from good reference material the biblethe prisoner who are you i am number 2 who is number 1 you are number 6 i am not a numberbe seeing you,black_comedy
wow i was expecting a lot from this maybe that was the problem the ads read best movie of the century  ranks with wizard of oz as an american classic people this is jim carrey for gods sakes i know tv stars can make the switch its been known to happen but this is ridiculous it was mediocre family movie that was about one notch above a made for tv movie im glad it didnt win any oscars either this movie wasnt an underdog it was out of its leaguepleasantville was ten times a better movie i dont care which was first lets just forget the serious actor schtick ok or perhaps ace ventura meets ernast in the army part 12 is already in the works,black_comedy
this movie is one of the very few ever made that makes you laugh and cry at the same time a work of pure genius showcases jim carreys enormous talents as an unaware man called truman burbank who has been taped his entire life without knowing ithowever he starts noticing things and becomes quite suspicious of his surroundings what goes from there is pure moviemaking magic its a shame that carrey didnt even get nominated for his role at the academy awards because he more than deserved it my rating4 out of 4 stars,black_comedy
how good is in my opinion it depends on how much you know beforehand i already knew quite a lot about the film before i saw it and frankly i thought the first half was weird if not messy i was hoping for an immediate explanation of whats going on introducing more of christofs involvement so the second half which was more satisfying seemed to come too late but when i thought about it more i realised that my disappointment regarding the first half was due to what i knew already a total stranger to the film will see the first half be confused rather than impatient and then marvel at the unravelling in the second half rather than say yeah and this should have come earlier all in all a very good attempt to cover an ingenious topic which is so complex most producers would probably shirk away from it a final word jim carrey is absolutely superb 85 out of 10,black_comedy
is about as depressing as anything i know  it is about a society that is so jaded that the interactions in their lives are wholly inadequatethey prefer a fictionalized world to their own  what is really sad is that this began in the fifties with father knows best and leave it to beaver and exists now in the tiresome parade of sitcoms with their vacuous double entendres and empty lives marching across the screen whose wholesomeness whose sexual manifestations are these  with children gunning each other down in schoolsdesensitized to common respect and im not just talking violence but respect for anything to mindless thoughtless pursuits of gratification  we are the idiots watching  the greatest tragedy is that what might be looked at as outrageous is actually occurring every daywe just havent put artificial walls around our little townjim carrey is quite goodhe can shine those pearly whites at the camera with the best  but couldnt it have been anyone  his efforts to free himself are not of significant because it can all be rewritten anyway  his obstacles are not important because it isnt the actors who are staging thisits on the other side of the cardboard  for a movie which qualifies as modern fantasy this is anything but,black_comedy
people say this movie is about challenging god garden of eden style but if you look at how christof fits into the movies world its really about challenging ones ideas about god about finding freedom in the real world we were intended to live in weirnichols dont dictate what reality is outside and they dont just tell you what happens to truman because that isnt the point the point is that anything can happen now hes out hes broken free of all the old useless ideas of ideas of himself and empty relationships there were so many little visual things in this movie like the boat being called the santa maria and the physical beauty of the last scene perfect for the role was carreys vulnerability and the innocent dignity with which he carried himself this is nothing new if youve ever seen him interviewed he always seemed to me like a very sensitive man and an intelligent actor he just has a sense of humour and few inhibitionshe does what he feels like doing however loud he wants to do it and everyone accuses him of being an idiot who cant act wonderful supportive artistic community i also thought the movie said a lot about how people can be objectified even when you really like them at first truman seems like a goofy sort of guy harmless and sweet but the movie opens up and you realize that theres this person inside whos very wounded and yet very determined,black_comedy
although having had higher expectation as a result of the mediaexposure its a good movie except for the mask the first movie in which i can appreciate jim carrey ed harris shines as the dictatorial directorwith a paternal twist in the end the special effects where very appealing and added strongly to the humorous scenes,black_comedy
this movie was one of the best i can say ive ever seen it always was eerie and surprising but kept on track really amazingly a 4 movie,black_comedy
not a word about the plot you know it the best thing of this movie is the need to think you have after think about tv programs you hate but have great audience you think about how false people can be think about freedom and free will think about you as truman in a plastic world no one really cares about you they are paid for loving you what an ugly false world our world listen to christof is better isnt it false as seahaven can people be so cruel just after the end of the show the tragedy of trumans choice they ask for more niccol and weir merit my special awards for best movie script and idea carrey is perfect in his role in italy we say 10 e lode,black_comedy
peter weir is one of the most interesting directors working today  his casting of jim carrey as the titular truman may have raised some eyebrows but then weir has never been known for his conventionality  weir has a way of drawing great or at least greatish performances out of his actors robin williams in dead poets society rosie perez in fearless  and carrey has shown seeds of greatness before rent doing time on maple drive if you can find it to see what im talking about  trumans entire life since the day of his birth has been orchestrated on a giant television studio set the only world truman knows and televised worldwide as  truman represents something impossibly difficult to find in our society today an absolutely innocent person  this goes a long way to explain his publics fascination with him  ed harris brings a bizarre dignity and ethic to his portrayal of christos the godlike creator and director of  this delicately beautiful film shows us the utter hypocrisy of our media and the herdlike docility with which we accept that very hypocrisy  although it doesnt offer many answers it asks a lot of the right questions,black_comedy
you probably know  the basic plot of by now and  thats probably due to the power of  television advertising a baby who is called truman burbank is nurtured to manhood for thirty years as the subject of a generations long soap but he is never told that hes a television star every one he knows is an actor including his wife and best friend who have been contracted to act on a specially constructed set for five thousand hidden cameras they are all recording the growth and life of truman burbank on 24 hour television the soap called is a runaway success making billions for the producers through product endorsements but runs into problems when truman starts to realise that something is wrong he starts to discover the lie jim carrey plays truman as a bland everyman as far removed from ace ventura or even the cable guy as could be imagined although there are still elements of carreys manic characters hidden behind the ordinariness in particular that peculiar throwing the head back laugh of his most comics ache to do drama serious acting and carrey has enough clout and money now to throw in the odd comparatively straight movie this one is still a bit twisted though hes blessed in by having aussie peter weir in charge a thoughtful director with an amazingly impressive cv including witness the year  of living dangerously  fearless dead poets society mosquito coast the cars that ate paris and picnic at hanging rock weir with has concocted a very steady pensive film which is a comment on the processes evilness and effects of live television is thought provoking because it seems feasible we could believe that a television corporation would invest the millions it would have taken to create buy itself a baby lead actor and then deceive that child for decades for the entertainment of the masses we can also believe i think that its possible that the viewing public and a government could have sanctioned such a process arguing no doubt that since the childadult is living an idyllic suburban life style then what harm could possibly have been done and anyway lets entertain the public give em what they want the public the audience of love it they avidly watch this soap during the intervals in  their own lives in truman show bars and i can imagine them living trumans life with him in their own toilets on buses and  in post offices and banks if there still is such a thing in this future as a post office and a bank such an audience would hate to miss a thing after all it is often easier to confront someone elses problems and life choices rather than your own then there are the deceptions themselves just how fanciful are the scenarios suggested by this movie a subplot of involves an actress played by natascha mcelhone  who gains a conscience and tries to tell burbank about the lie that is his whole life but what about the others in particular his best friend played by noah emmerich and also his wife laura linney who seems to be in a particularly invidious moral position is this how low mass entertainment might stoop can we expect worse in the future have we already seen worse the clinton affair the di soapy and most of the oprah stuff is pretty weird already and what about the audience the consumers of burbank trumans life they cheer truman on when he rushes to escape but youd bet that they would demand a replacement quick smart a dream filler from tv land how could the addicts of a show like live without another shallow dream to take its place puts interesting questions to us all and is a strongly realised social comment from one of our fabulous aussie directors nothing new is suggested really except for the scale of the deception in but peter weir does create his film world with great precision and believability oliver stones natural born killers was on a similar theme and even the simpsons has had a good go at sensationalist tv in that famous episode where homer gets into trouble for allegedly pinching  his baby sitters bum for those who might be interested takes two hours to tell us little we didnt know already and for all of its superior qualities seems a little thin  i would have liked to have followed truman burbank out into the real world perhaps along the lines of bad boy bubby but still has me thinking and thats an achievement these days,black_comedy
is not a comedy although thats where i found it at my local video store  its a difficult film to categorize part science fiction part social satire part romance  one thing i can say is that its a masterpiece of storytelling and filmmaking  rent this movie you wont be disappointedone last question is what the hell happened at the academy awards,black_comedy
this is cinema at its best a completely original and deeply moving masterpiece that left a real impression on me you know a films good when ya still thinking about it months later and this movie had many memorable moments especially that scene on the pierits uniquebrilliant performances by both jim carrey and ed harris i dont get why carrey got a golden globe but wasnt even nominated at the oscars they both woz robbedtrust me when i say seeing this is a must,black_comedy
i really liked  it is one of my favorite movies  i enjoyed the movie on just about every level and i found the story line to be easy to understand and very meaningful as well  jim carrey did a superb job in his character i was pleased to see that he could perform a serious role so well  i also loved the details in the movie like the ways omnicam manufactured ways to keep truman on the island  its an amazing plot the way all of trumans life was viewed by millions without him being aware the only weak points i found involved the movie being a bit farfetched only in the effects like being able to create artificial thunderstorms in a manmade dome  i also thought that the ending could have been a bit longer but as a whole it was brilliant i was very disappointed it did not receive more oscar nominations,black_comedy
i was just wondering why people think this movie is a comedy i thought it was scary sad and incredibly compelling reminded me of the matrix where the people really didnt know that the real world is out therei think that the most terrifying thing would be if this concept was true that the world is a stage and we are its actors if it was true how would we know are we really just a part of a grand tv show to some superior being dont certain religions teach something like thatthis movie gets an 810 because it got me thinking it made me see that life is just a bloody play act anyway we act everything anyway dont we we go to work and act therewe go home to our families and act there we say our prayersand act again  is nothing real even love doesnt it turn into an act after a whiledarn it folks im off to find myself some realityi wish all actors a good afternoon good evening and a good night,black_comedy
its lacking something that would make me call it great but i love the premise a real everyone is out to get you sort of thing and brilliant performance by jim carey and it was very satisfying its also something that can infuriate you as the viewer when you see the shows producers try to manipulate him and keep him from living a real life very powerful stuffwhen you watch this the most difficult thing is figuting out trumans character and getting into him but once you are youll feel general compassion for him and he becomes a true hero one of the rair times carey actually plays a likeable character the only other time i can think of would be in liar liar,black_comedy
every year my family and i have our own personal oscar awards was nominated for over ten and won eight including best picture actor supporting actor and original screenplay what was the real academy thinking when they didnt nominated carrey or the movie itself the is one of the most original movies of the decade,black_comedy
peter weirs truman show is my favorite movie of 1998 and i still cant understand the decisions of the oscar jury not even to nominate this movie for best picture so heres my toast to this exceptional comedydrama that should become one of the classics in movie historyalthough i liked shakespeare in love very much and think that saving private ryan is an important movie the story of truman burbank touched me like no other film jim carrey plays well ed harris is great and the scene where he speaks to his child from heaven is perfect the movie has the exact length andrew niccols script makes you a witness to trumans life and wonder who is watching your life now at this moment its definitely the movie to watch if you like to be entertained in an intelligent way and the movie to own on tape or dvd,black_comedy
what can i say ive seen now 5 times in theaters and i am still under its spell this movie is touching  gripping dramatic funny frightening and philosophic together and it makes you think  and not only for a couple of minutes its simply magic thanks to p weir a niccol s rudin d gassner p biziou b dallwitz j carrey e harris the whole cast  crew for making this highly intelligent film  thank you so much and shame on the academy only 3 noms not a single award i refused to watch the oscarceremony but i am glad the film received 3 awards at the golden globes and also at the baftas  it really deserved it jim carrey is simply great as naive everyman and tortured soul truman burbank who eventually desperately wants to find out if the truth is really out there although i liked liar liar and the mask i wasnt a jim carrey fan until recently now i am i was fascinated by his engaging touching performance he found the right way between comedy and drama as well as the rest of the crew set design and cinematography are both excellent the score is one of the best i have heard for a long time  b dallwitz did a great job and also did p glass i know many people complained about the ending  i loved it abrupt and nicely ambiguous once again you have to think for yourself hows it going to end peter weir has made a lot of great movies but this one surely will go down in movie history sensational,black_comedy
is very good but the start is to slow but it is very useful for the rest of the story line apart from that good morning and if i dont see you good afternoon good evening and good nightbruno,black_comedy
thank god for peter weir he did it for harrison ford and now hes done it for jim carrey again is there anything ozzies cant do an extremely good movie well made well acted especially ed harris and of course jim acted wellthe conceptstory line is original which is rare and good these days it makes you think p,black_comedy
was certainly one of the best movies that i have  recently seenthe basic idea is very weird but it is great fun to watch the efforts director and truman show staff go through to keep truman from suspecting he is watched i especially liked the idea to start with the fictional truman show titles instead of the official titles the illusion is perfect even for the viewer in the theatrei wonder when this story will come true,black_comedy
when i first saw this film i didnt know exactly what to expect i was used to seeing jim carrey in crazy psycho mode in such films as ace ventura and liar liar but when i saw this film my breath was taken away seeing jim carrey in a truly great role that will live forever in the minds of people everywhereas truman burbank carrey is an insurance salesman who has no idea that his life is being broadcast 24 hours a day onto live television from a series of intricately placed cameras by a bizarre man named christof ed harris there isnt much star power other than these two but people such as laura linney noah emmerich and natascha mcelhone give great performancesafter a strange chain of events including a light falling from the sky being pushed against advertisements and the reappearance of his dead father truman starts to think something is awrywhen the oscar nominations were announced on february 9 i was very surprised that could only get away with 3 nominations sure they were good nominations best director best supporting actor and best original screenplay but i think that jim carrey was robbed as he indicated with his win at the golden globes he indicated the oscar would be pretty good as he did at the oscars too that an oscar would be great best picture and best original dramatic score which it deserves slipped from their graspi think that this film didnt get the success it deserved sure critics loved it and jim carrey won many more fans but this film the best of 1998 will live in the hearts of millions forever,black_comedy
this was a great movie the performances from jim carrey and ed harris are amazing and i believe they both should have taken home oscars as well as peter weir and andrew niccol for writing and directing andrew niccol has written another great movie his first one in gattaca was excellent and this story is even better also the musical score in this movie is great this has got to be one of the best movies ever made,black_comedy
wow ive just finished watching this film and i cant even begin to describe how much it has made me think about life it is the kind of film that everyone would want to have thought of i give it 1010if you begin to watch this film but are then put off by its subtlety and hidden meaning all i can say is please dont give up on it the beginning is hard to understand but it soon gets easier to follow and more and more insane jim carreys acting especially at the end is brilliant it is so touching yet in a way sinister and spooky it is unreal to think anyones life could be like that is impossiblethis has definitely got to be one of the best films i have ever seen and i certainly wouldnt say no to seeing it again just to understand it more and more the acting is incrediblewhich leaves me to say watch it if you havent yet and believe me im not just saying that,black_comedy
the success is bedded in the originality of the story it is a brilliantly original super movie  ace ventura tends to still cling to jim carrey but he did real good the other actors does not really have a score to make an acting stand to make a real impression i think the movie could have been a few minutes longer building on the plot of getting free  a brainwashed person like this would not just walk out the people who opened his eyes could have come in stronger i would have liked truman on the outside for two minutes  as well  as an ending  the music was strong and complimented the movie excellently,black_comedy
this is one of those films that leaves you thinking for a while it has a lot of a message in it a message about will and determination it has good acting and directing although the editing wasnt that good but anyway i dont see how this film wasnt nominated for any oscar yet the first 20 minutes of saving private ryan were shouldnt we be tired already of the hundred different ways to present the same tiresome and cliched topic of ww2 then when something new comes along we dont even pay attention to it,black_comedy
the movie starts off pleasantly enough an average man in an average town normal in all ways except for the fact that his life is actually a 24hour tv program watched by the entire world sounds rather twilight zone right wrong this is better than anything ive seen on the twilight zone this was absolute heart stopping action from start to finish i couldnt believe how fast my adrenaline was pumping or how hard my heart was beating this obviously isnt a james bond flick or a movie with mel gibson but this isnt ace ventura or dumb and dumber when you begin to watch this movie forget everything you know about jim carrey why because you will meet a different actor a totally different man in my opinion the movie was robbed of an oscar nomination jim carrey was robbed of a best actor nomination and he absolutely deserved the golden globe he received a few months backif you dont believe anything ive said believe this please dont avoid watching this movie because of what someone else said dont avoid this movie because of jim carrey watch this movie if you dont youll be missing out on one of the best movies of 1998 if not of all time and thats what i think,black_comedy
the best film of 1998the first thing is that this is a peter weir film not a jim carrey film though he was great in a breakout role and should have been nominated for the oscar  this film is very hitchkockian  the feel is one of menace under a thin veil of normalcy  this is added to by the production design and cinematographythe acting is great  ed harris gives great support to carrye as the sinister father figure christofthe script is so subtle it probably feels more clever than it isit is ultimately a very moving modern fable about a man trying to be his own person when the world is trying to manipulate him into being what they wantin case i dont see ya good afternoon good evening and good night,black_comedy
on the air unaware being watched by the whole world its show time it is a touching story of a lifetime that shows how insensible the human being can be manipulating a mans life and feelings confining him to a surreal world where life can even be perfect but is lack of sensibility just because it makes good television with this extremely inspiring and original screenplay by andrew niccol spectacular art direction by richard l johnson and costume design by marilyn matthews a wonderful dramatic score composed by burkhard dallwitz a show of interpretations by jim carrey as truman burbank and ed harris as christof and a remarkable direction by peter weir is an entertaining and dramatic cinematographic production that makes us think about our own lives are they really true or they are full of actors and frustrations the decision between the true life and belongs to us,black_comedy
what if you were put on this planet for a specific reason what  if you are the most important person there iswhat if you are just a pawn in for someone elses game that you are not aware of these are questions that almost everyone asks themselves now and then in their lifetime for truman burbank his whole life are all answers to these questions hes just on a 24 hour 7 days a week soap opera of his life where he is the star only hes unaware of it to him life is normal in his happy sappy world but he is the only true person everyone else are just actors even his family he suddenly wakes up and smells the coffee when he notices strange things or accidents such as his wedding pictures the elevater incident and many more my only question would be why would you do this to someone i think its cruel to use anyone as a pawn in a game im talking real life not chess when im feeling low sometimes i ask myself am i for some purpose is there a big brother your own personal angel you could call it even figure looking after just me or am i just like everyone elsewhere as trumans life was controlled in his happy sappy communistic type world where he never gets a moment to himself except maybe when hes using the crapper ares is as well through corrupt goverments spy satellites armies etc etc etci do believe im here for some reason whether im the pawn of the world or everyone is with me i dont know but the latter is probably right or is it i give this movie a  so good morning and in case i dont see you good afternoon good evening and good night,black_comedy
some people have boring life so they watch other peoples exciting life on tv some people are not able to enjoy life so they watch other peoples good life on tv most people are just too lazy to have a life so they watch other peoples life on tv part of the movie is a mockery of tv viewersis a delightful movie dealing with a serious subject ie the big three where are we from why are we here and where are we going after death the movie didnt ask those questions nor did it answer them the theme seems to be that the truth is out there and well be free if we find out the truth the end of the movie hinted that love is the answeri wish its simple as thatjim carrey was a good fit for the role i couldnt think any one else would do better for this movie,black_comedy
this film brought back echoes of three great james stewart films these are harvey imdb 143250 mr smith goes to washington imdb  54250 and its a wonderful life imdb 27250these films like are warm and the characters played by the stars are human characters who evoke feelings of empathy with the audience jim carrey excels as truman delivering the greatest performance of his career to date i must admit that prior to this film i was not a fan of his but i am forced to acknowledge his talent i hope he does more serious workthe film itself is thought provoking and disturbing viewing the public as voyeurs and the media as the exploiters of this i suspect many famous people who have been the victims of the paparazzi must empathise with trumanthis film is a must see and is destined to be one of the top ten films of the 1990s others may win oscars but will not i suspect have the longevity of this film,black_comedy
how did this movie not get nominated for best picture  this film was very original funny sad and touching  it proves along with his golden globe that jim carrey can act and act very very well  this film was absolutely incredible  perhaps the acadamy should rethink their choices 910,black_comedy
good morning first of all id like to say that i am one of the many people that loved i saw many comments on that movie and some people find it too complicated or hard to understand everyone has a different opinion some people like it some people dont i even saw people talking about the fact that its impossible that an human being stay alive more than 30 years without getting any light from the sun and its alright like thati am personally a jim carrey fan and i think that most of the other fans of mr carrey were ready for the transition he made in of course if you go to the theater with the idea to see a jim carrey movie like ace ventura or liar liar you will maybe be disappointed but if you know that the movie is first of all a drama you will get out of the theater wonderfully transformed its like for the cable guy some people went to the theater thinking they would see something like dumb and dumber and were disappointed the cable guy was a dark comedy is a drama if you know that before seeing the movie you will not be disappointedi said that transforms and it really does maybe not everyone will get into the story but for those who will like i did youll search cameras in your bedroom and im not kidding when i say that i got the first ticket for at the theater of my city and i saw 3 times in the first 5 days it was at the theater at all i saw it 7 times at the theater i think that peter weir did a great pure touching and wonderful movie the soundtrack is also wonderful and one of the posters of the movie the one with the hundreds of pictures from the movie is quite fascinating i think that liar liar is the most funny movie of jim carrey but that is his most intelligent and touching movie what can i say more is an excellent and touching movie and a wonderful entertainment oh and in case i dont see you good afternoon good evening and goodnight,black_comedy
jim carrey  really come on  where is the acadamy award nomination hello he deserves best actor more than anybody  this is absolutely pathetic  who are these voters  jim carrey is getting robbed of his talent the movie was the best of the 90s  jim carrey is best actor of the year hands down,black_comedy
i loved this movie especially the last 40 minutes  however the middle of the movie was a bit tedious  how many conversations with his best friend do we need to hear  as good as it was it could have been even better   i think ed harris playing the shows producer steals the show at the end,black_comedy
this film was too overhyped and at times boring i like jim carrey he is a very good actor and he didnt do that bad for a serious role ed harris well ive seen better from him so i dont see why he should win an oscar for this movieanyways the plot was fine but i think that we didnt need this film to prove to us that what we see on tv isnt real but then again there are people out there who do believe what they see on tv but have no opinion on itthe way people were suckers for in this film made me wanna vomit it shows that people will follow someones life on tv instead of their very own it goes to show you what your own personal god can beoverall it really isnt a masterpiece to me and i was expecting a lot better for this film oh well but thats my opinion,black_comedy
well im a carrey fan but i dont hate this movie the first 20 minutes was a bit boring then about the time truman suspects something strange is going on is when the movie picks up then up and down till the last 20 minutes all in all it was pretty good i give it 12 out of ,black_comedy
like another of the commentators before me this movie reminded me of the prisoner television program is a somewhat thoughtful little film and raises some interesting questions about the nature of privacy and of freedom and free will the problem i had with it was the premise i can sort of allow myself to be convinced that a man can be raised under such circumstances and not be any the wiser providing he is kept happy enough not to examine his world too closely heck i know people like that what i cant swallow is that so many people could be so enthralled by the act of observing him sleep eat pass wind pick his nose etc that it could survive for thirty years on the air the most surprising thing about this film is jim carreys performance sure his comic persona may peek out once in a while and might be a bit inapropriate but its the mark of a potentially great actor who is still a little hesitant to let go for a while of the thing that made his career soar ive heard it said before that he has the makings of a first rate actor if ever he is given the right opportunity to develop after seeing id have to agree what were tom hanks and robin williams doing fifteen years ago,black_comedy
what occurs in the first act of is about as good as it gets  the expectations for this movie and probably most of its overrated praise are based on the first half of the movie in which the ed harris character describes no scripts no cuecards and most importantly that truman jim carrey in not a serious role but one not nearly as silly as hes played before is a genuine character not artificially created  now if this were all true and the movie evolved as it should have along these lines perhaps it would deserve all the praise it is getting  however everything that happens in the later 23 of the movie completely undermines everything weve been lead to believe about this world truman lives in imagine my utter disapointment when during what seemed like a truely emotional scene between truman and his best friend we cut to the control room to find the best friend being fed his lines  what was that about not cue cards  what follows completely destroys what was one a wonderful premise and gives no hope of redemption  even when truman finally goes against the odds and attempts to escape the small island it turns out to be a case of too little too late,black_comedy
this movie made me think about our whole existence whats the difference between real life and this show isnt your life just a path laid out for you by different interests your best friend who talks deep to you over a beer is maybe without knowing it planted by the beer industry to give you a beer consuming lifestyle our gloob is the world can we break out,black_comedy
i note some imdb reviewers comments those people who describe as boring or not funny completely miss the point i would venture to suggest that they are the kind of individuals who watched every episode of dallas or dynasty or for my fellow brits coronation street or eastenders these types do not like to have their addiction mocked which this movie does so well real life is not perfect with every little thing being organised to suit as someone once said st happens although i may not have cast the admittedly excellent carrey as truman his eventual desire to find out if the truth is out there is human nature at its most real dont we all want to know the truth to our lives overall an original movie and god knows there are few enough of them check it out and dont forget to engage brain before viewing,black_comedy
was an interesting and well portrayed premise jim carrey and ed harris were wonderful in their roles  whats surprising about the film is that ed harris captured an academy award nomination for his role but jim carrey didnt  i suppose the academy only has a limited number of nominations  all in all a very good film  definitely worth a good look,black_comedy
yes its jim carreys best movie but why does he insist on throwing in those thankfully few muggy faces and why did peter weir let him otherwise an engaging light comedy that plays off the twilight zoneesque premise that ones entire life is simply someone elses experiment weir abstains from making this a onejoke film by carefully shifting control back and forth between the mad documentarian ed harris to truman carrey the supporting cast is hardly spectacular but theyre all supposed to be tv actors right,black_comedy
is entertaining at the same time that it is frightening the frightening insight into is that the main characters very life is television  the kicker is that he does not realize it  every part of his life his daily routine from when he gets up to when he goes to bed and even while he sleeps is broadcast to the world  he exists in kind of the ultimate fishbowl a gargantuan artificial terrarium one of only two structures in the world that are visible from space that contains within it the village of seahaven a coastal town where truman burbank the unwitting star lives and works as an insurance agentthe film provides a semiserious role for jim carrey an actor who i at first found tasteless but have recently grown to respect not the least because of his performance in this movie  he is required to walk a fine line between comedy and wistfullness   it is a tricky job but he pulls it off creating a believable performance as a man who is just beginning to suspect that there is something off in his universemore than anything else the movie gives the audience a lot to think and talk about  the modern media has entered into our private lives to a unprecedented degree over the last two decades  although i doubt such an undertaking could ever be seriously contemplated just how far are we from  how far are we willing to go  the film also raises serious questions about the quality of life  is is better to live a life in paradise and never know it is fake and that everyone is watching or to live in our reality  it may seem like a simple question but just think about it and it wont seem so simple and then watch this movie,black_comedy
the film brilliant carrey brilliant special effects brilliant film editing brilliant philip glass music a little overthetop but brilliant i am not condemning the academy for the choices they have made but in the process some serious talent was overlooked this is carreys most brilliant film to date unless man on the moon lives up to its hype this is probably one of the greatest cinematic masterpieces of the 20th century and even if carrey wasnt decided to be the grestest candidate for the oscar the film shouldve been,black_comedy
a lot of words are said in favor of truman show i will just mention some disadvantages i enjoy comedies or whatever you call it that make you think and satirical way of speaking about such a things like relationship pretending meaning of life etc but i can recall only tvseries really good in this style for example the naked truth third rock from the sun married with children maybe there was too much humor  in truman show it was too unreal or simply this style is better for  tvseries but while i watched the movie truman entertained me and only the idea behind the movie made me think truman was too happy and smiling to be a person who suspects everything is not real in his life 710,black_comedy
some of you who sit down to watch this movie will probably hear a great deal about the plot before you press play if you have yet to be exposed cover your ears the premise of this film is so unusal you must allow for some elements of surprise i was totally enthralled and really had no idea what would happen next granted i think most will predict how does this thing end little white pinbutton but i would advise you not to try just kick back relax and enjoy the fantasy its a great onejim carey does his usual fair share of overacting but it seems to work just fine here the other players are essentially dwarfed by carreys performance ed harris however does an excellent job in a supporting role peter weirs direction is meticulous and highly effectiveeven if you dont like this film it will make you ponder just a bit those who let themselves get drawn in to bizarre storyline will simply love it,black_comedy
i wouldve never thought that jim carrey would do it but he was fantastic in this movie  this movie has every clich under the sun comedy romance drama etc  director peter weir gives us a look into one real person truman burbank out of many actors in a world centered around him  we would all love to have the world revolve around us but this film depicts that it can be distressing as it was for trumani thought the movie was one of the best films i have ever seen because of its great acting and unpredictability but i was deeply upset that this movie was not nominated for best picture this year for the oscars  cmon look at the full monty  that was nominated for best picture last year  i was glad nonetheless that it was nominated for best director supporting actor ed harris and screenplay  i give this movie a definite 10but i hope jim carrey doesnt drop his comedy acting,black_comedy
never have i ever been so amazed by a film i saw 8 times when it was in theaters i live in a small town so the clerk actually said to me once it wasnt that great but i told him he wasnt watching the same movie i was its great only peter wier could make me fall in love with jim carrey i wasnt jims biggest fan at first after this came out bam wow jim is one of the finest actors hollywood will ever know check his cameo in simon birch hes worth every single little penny they pay him it isnt just carrey ed harris makes this movie a done deal i look for him to take the oscar for supporting actor and finally peter wier man of the hour i was always a big fan of his ever since the year of living dangerously but this is amazing if you havent seen this movie more than 8 times go rent it,black_comedy
i knew i wanted to see this film when i saw the first trailer i was surprised however that weir had chosen for his title character jim carrey all i had seen of him previously was inane physical comedy who knewcarrey was an excellent choice he was able to be funny and yet portray a man whose world was closing in around him like the characters glued to their television sets i became involved in and with its main character ironically the only one who was realas the credits rolled i could hear peoples comments as they left the cinema i was shocked to hear some of them saying it was the worst movie they had ever seen were we watching the same thing i can respect others opinions but it is still a mystery how anyone could not like this film i suppose those moviegoers accustomed to carreys previous body of work and its shameless use of bodily functions to draw laughs could be disappointed how sad for those who remain closed to new ideas,black_comedy
watching was like watching an episode of the xfilesa creepy yet fascinating experience many elements of the film do not make sense until a few hours after one has seen the movie christof his booming voice emitted from the sky represents godyet he also reminded me of a communist leader i think it was the idea that truman and all of the other actors were equal under one producer this went for the staffers as well there was also the allegorical concept of the film such as trumans name truman was the only true man on the island he was also true to himself at the end then there is the motif of the eyes the cameras serve as eyes but we also see sylvias eyes gazing at truman and christofs piercing gaze a fascinating motif finally there is the aspect of water biblically god created a flood that covered then earth christof creates a storm that kills trumans father it was chilling to watch christof stroke the picture of truman on tv it was a sickening reminder of the lie that truman was forced to livethe entire concept of the film is frightening to have your entire life on television for the world to see is difficult to swallow yet most importantly like  pleasantville asks you to think and films that accomplish this feat are fine accomplishments indeed,black_comedy
let me say that is hands down the greatest film ever made i like the whole movie my favorite part is when he escapes they had perfect cinematography also the story was great jim carrey got a well deserved golden globe for best drama actor this is by far a perfect movie it is my favorite movie i give it my top rating 10 s,black_comedy
because he is the real brain behind this movie writer it surely is a very original movie but an oscar come onfor me it was very boring most of the time until the final scene which i liked very very much it was brilliantly donejim carrey is an excellent actor the best comedian in the usa and maybe the world  only for watching him i could tolerate this movie i definitely liked much more liar liar and even the mask or ace ventura but this one was different i have to admit itmy respect to the writer,black_comedy
i was very disappointed to see that did not get a nomination for best picture this film is in one word incredible peter weirs masterpiece gives us a dark multi layered satire of a media obsessed voyeuristic societymany accuse of being a one trick pony but they are wrong paradoxily to really get you have to see the big picture if you analyze every bit of the film it becomes repetitive and thats the point the majority of the people in the world do not analyze films to deathwhat you see is what you get and thats how you have to view what makes it so amazing is that it satirizes albeit darkly so many unlikely cultural staples gated communities the viewing audience and media stardrom yet you cant really see this unless you look at the film as a whole anyone understand what i mean jim carrey gives us a wonderfully restrained yet manic performance as truman burbank ed harris megalomanical christof also adds greatly to the film my one complaint overly saccahrine meryl although i suppose that goes along with the satire one of my favorite films ever period,black_comedy
jim carrey in his best movie until know the cable guy one of the most underestimated movie and liar liar were also great but this one really hits the top this is a movie that will keep you thinking,black_comedy
no this isnt the greatest film ever but it is one of the most original jim carrey and ed harris are great and definitely deserve oscar nods the movie starts off kinda slow but in the second half you become totally engrossed with trumans flight to freedom  no matter how large or beautiful a prison is it is still a prison,black_comedy
jim carrey wowed critics and audiences alike as unwitting truman burbank in this marvel superbly shot by director peter weir about a man whose life is a nonstop tv show produceddirected and created by christof and wonderfully played by ed harris jim carrey plays truman burbank an insurance salesman in a small town called seaviewthis movie is the most original and interesting concept in a long time theres no annoying facepulling no rearrelated jokes and no overthe top antics at all isnt even a comedy more a drama with some comedic elements most of the film is shown from the same viewpoint as a person watching the tv show would see details of his life are shown in flashbacks of previous episodes and some real life views of people watching trumanwith a great performance by carrey a superbly witty screenplay from niccol and another fabulous directorial effort from weir who manages to perfectly balance big laughs with more subtle humor and a few touching moments is a cinematic treat as tasty as anything youll find at the concession stand,black_comedy
i think everyone is making such a big deal out of this because jim carrey has done a dramatic movie  its a good movie with some terrific moments good acting and it does make you think but its not even close to being a favorite of mine if you really think about it if it was made with jeff bridges or another actor it wouldnt get any attention at all,black_comedy
is my favorite film when i heard jim carrey was starring in another film i was a little disappointedid always found him to be a little obnoxious but as i watched the trailers i began to think that carrey has been holding out on us perhaps he was just preparing himself for this role here it is jim carrey as truman burbank is my nomination for one of the finest if the the finest of all movie characterizations believe me i know of all the movies i know of jimmy stewart in its a wonderful life of cary grant in bringing up baby and of the other great performances my knowledge of films is not just of the past 20 years so believe me when i say carrey has with this one film earned himself a place in the history bookshe works on several levelsfirst of all there is the comedy he makes us laugh and at funny thingsnot just a lot of crude silliness this is talent unseen since the days of the great comics carrey could if he continued making intelligent comedies like this one be ranked alongside chaplin and buster keaton in his use of pathos most comics no all comics of the last thirtysome years have been afraid to use pathos in their routines pathos is basically mixing something sentimental with something funny making it touchingly funny this is real skill jim carrey has that talent and will hopefully realize that he is capable of acting not obtained since charlie chaplin this is an honor hopefully he will select other intelligent projects like this one he has the talent to become the greatest actor not just funnyman in the cinema of the future everyone i know shares this opinion i saw the film on its theatrical run twice and yet i dont want to run to the video store to get the latest copy of it and lounge in front of the tv with it on why because is so brilliant and so intelligent that it must be viewed with intelligence itself somehow you are much more inclined to sit up and pay attention and think in a cinema than you would be popping the video in the vcr and lounging back with a bowl of chips the film has a wonderful musical score although it has now been some 8 months sine i saw the film the incidental music themes still pop in to my head every so often and again although it has been 4 months short of a year since i saw the film it seems like it was just last week that is how timeless and meaningful it really is you just dont forget this one it is incredible and unbelievable i was intrigued from the first time i saw the trailer on television the film has stayed with me like no other a local cinema that runs nothing but the best films old and new ran a print of this film for a week it is such a magnificent experience to see that both times i saw it i left the theatre truly feeling glad to be able to see the film i hope that it earns its proper place in the cinema history books and that is as the greatest film in the latter half of the 20th century,black_comedy
i was surprised when i saw this movie i didnt know jim carrey could be such a great actor i think the movie is the only one that has a shot of beating spr at the oscars by seeing all the comments written here you can see that this is a movie that makes you think and it was a mix of a really artistic movie with a blokbuster movie i give it a 10,black_comedy
it is very original though its kinda slow it was definitely weird to see jim carrey play this role but i liked it well theres not much to comment on but my advice it could have used a little comedy,black_comedy
i think this was a very good movie with a very clever script and excellent performancesthe biggest surprise though wasnt the story but the fact that carrey really actedprobably for the first time of his lifehad it not been for his annoying facei wouldnt believe that it was himanywaylets hope that he will continue to perform in movies like this oneinstead of doing more of those pet detectivelike movies,black_comedy
very good movie criticises the mass media of the united states with imaginative angles and very good acting performance but it didnt have the success i suspected just cause of jim carrey dont worry you get to believe that he is an actor he actually acts amazing but he does,black_comedy
all i have to say about this film is wow i went into this movie hearing a lot of people say that it wasnt any good the movie is a surreal fantasy and it sets itself up from the very beginning those of you who have read my comments on imdb before know that my favorite thing in a film is atmosphere this film has a great atmosphere from the very beginning and never lets up i had heard many different things about jim carreys performance all i can say is that this is the best performance of his career so far and shows that he is much more than just a great slapstick actor peter weir has done an excellent job with this film and andrew niccols screenplay is amazing dont go into this film looking for ace ventura or dumb and dumber youll only be let down this is a totally original film and a brilliant exhibition of the films hollywood should make more often,black_comedy
ive watched quite a few movies over the years  the friendly neighborhood blockbuster video people could probably retire on the money theyve made renting to just me  ive seen the entire afi 100 and every critically acclaimed movies that i can find  even so id have to say that is one of the greatest movies ever to come out of hollywood  its a perfect film  the acting is great the screenplay is phenomenal and it is a very deep and symbolic movie  ive seen it seven times and i pick up something new every time i watch it  even the title characters name truman burbank is oxymoronic and symbolic  he is a true man who is the product of hollywood  you can even spot a few allusions to the crucifixion when christof tries to stop truman from escaping by flipping his boat  the depiction of a utopian society reminded me of alduous huxleys brave new world a world were freedom did not truly exist even though the citizens thought it did  why did they not do anything  its just like christof said in a memorable and disturbing quote we accept the reality of the world with which we are presented  this cynicism is thrown at you one last time in the final scene of the movie  two security guards upon realizing that the show is over shrug and say hmm its over lets see what else is on while stuffing their faces with pizza  likewise viewers of this movie may see it and say hmm its over without giving it a second thought not realizing the significance of the movie  dont see this movie if youre not willing to think  dont see this movie if youre looking for a superficial slapstick screwball comedy like most of carreys other pictures youll be disappointed if thats what youre looking for  see this movie if you are prepared to be challenged philosophically  along with a clockwork orange this is one of two movies that i have given a ten out of ten,black_comedy
after the surprisingly strong showing by this film at the golden globes i hope people will check it out again or if they havent seen it see it this got overlooked after saving private ryan which i also thought was terrific but this is terrific too  in addition to jim carreywho i normally dont like and ed harris who i do like who were both great i also think laura linney deserves praise as the actress playing trumans wife  she was hysterical especially during her product pitches  lets hope oscar remembers this film as well as the golden globes did,black_comedy
theres not much that i can say that hasnt already been said several times before so ill keep it brief  i have rarely seen a film as wellcrafted and as flawlessly thoughtout  the whole cast was terrific the direction was outstanding and theres really nothing that stands out as a weak link oscar or no oscar this film has already secured an important place in hollywoods history and justifiably so,black_comedy
who are you im your creator then who am i youre the star those are one of the last lines of  and     simply one of the best lines in the whole movie jim carrey and ed harris takes us to an odyssey of moral issues you can never think yourself as a god because the more you believe it the less your sons adore you when i saw this film i was in the biggest state of awe i have ever been in a long time in a movie theater i love all the camera angles in every frame the director photography mustve had quite a lot headaches trying to satisfy peter weir demands and in my opinion deserves and oscar as well as the editing art direction and music not to mention the great performances by ed harris who shouldve won the oscar a long time ago and jim carrey the first time he actually attracts the audience not only by his jokes and charm but also by his heart many people disagree by the ending the believe to be frivolous and incomplete but i believe they are wrong the whole movie is and after truman leaves the set the show is over thats the whole art of the issue if we get to see him in the outside world it would be some kind of sequel not precisely the show this is one of the most original movies of the 90s anyone who adores the art of making movies out there as much as i do dont miss it,black_comedy
i was so happy on the 24th of jan when carrey took home the prize you pick up something new every time you watch it a touching heartfelt daydream of a movie this is truly best picture 1998,black_comedy
first off this is jim carreys best performance ive ever seen although he still doesnt act very dramatic like some have believed he has a jolly cheerful character inside of him and is toned down from his past films which is acceptable consider him a world famous television icon if you will because is how simple everyday life compares simultaneously with a neverending broadcast in other words all truman all the time 24 hours a day 7 days a week lol many will miss carreys goofball personality which confirms a local newspaper out here giving this one of the worst five movies of 1998 well go figure you have many options of how to describe the movie is it based on real life accounts or is it an imaginative fantasy about the world media does it mean to be heartwarming or just made to be the highestrated television program in the world will it be funny or will it make you shed some tears its obvious that the first half tends to be tedious only for the second to be more meaningful as we finally understand our pal truman being under surveillance by a special broadcast control center past the heavens this bares a similarity with god in control of everything around him on the earth it appears like truman is the inspiration for every one of us who tune in overall i discovered the second half being the best feature but while it had the best entertaining value it goes by way too fast along with its final ending making me beg for more isnt a bad idea on peter weirs part but it might not be appealing enough to attract our strong desires for solid enjoyment i fare this film better than the newspaper gave it but as a whole i say above average,black_comedy
isnt always the same as a good film in this case a very good idea turns into an average hollywood production i would like to call it waste of good ideas,black_comedy
with the myriad of movies out there that are strictly formulated this was an incredibly refreshing movie  i thought that the plot line was very original and imaginative  what really got to me in this movie was not the technology but trumans relationship with his friends and how sad i thought it was that even his best friend was anything but  lots of deeper meanings meandering beneath the surface one is the coldness which people inflict upon one another using the excuse that it is professional or ok because everyone else is doing it  jim carrey puts in a very touching performance  ed harris was excellent as his own god  highly recommended,black_comedy
a film that provokes thought is always welcome this entertained and at the same time created certain unforgettably disturbing scenes  as one would expect from a director of this calibre im grateful for that but when i found myself asking why it hadnt grabbed me as powerfully as some of weirs other films i realized that he hadnt really made me care what happened to truman  i could see the horror of the idea but i felt no real emotional link to the hero its significant that imdb categorizes the film as dramaromance romance that side of the film  his emotional life flopped completely perhaps because the real climax of the film is the revelation of christofs upinspace studio the focus of the film switches totally  to the evil filmmaker and we succumb to the glitter of hightech filmmaking even if were supposed to be as frightened as we once were by big brother why were we not shown the full impact of the reunion with his father what on earth would they have said to each other what painjoy would truman have known and why are we not shown the wife walking out were told that it happened what pain must that have caused this sort of gap left the protagonist too onedimensional  which is a great pity because the parable is a powerful one worthy of our full involvementwas the casting of  jim carey responsible much as i like him he seemed far too happy and normal for a product of such an upbringing there could be no existential angst in such a chirpy grinner though he did try would someone with the permanently perplexed expression of a harrison ford have fitted better interesting because then it would have been heavier less amusing amusing was it a comedy then perhaps theres a genreconfusion here too comedydramaromance  it was  really a scifi parable that would have been more effective if it had been pitched somewhat higher i was interested to see that though its publicity attracted youngsters the large majority of those i  talked to  im a teacher    didnt enjoy it at all,black_comedy
jim carrey stars as truman burbank in an amazing inspiring movie which jim carrey deserves an oscar for great support from ed harris and a wonderful soundtrack this will go down in movie history,black_comedy
so as not to spoil the plot i am going to choose my words carefully  truman burbank is a man living in a sort of fishbowl world as the star of a tv series that brings hope and joy to millions of peopletruman is played by jim carrey brilliantly  his acting should definitely get him an oscar nomination  there is one long scene in the movie where truman doesnt say a word but you know exactly what hes thinking  kudos to peter weir as well for his masterful direction and to peter bizious cinematography  almost every shot in the film is from the point of view of a television camera and creates a kind of documentary feellets talk about suspense  is more suspenseful than many thrillers  it is impossible to tell what will happen next  this is due to andrew niccols scripta sure bet for a nomination for best picture is intelligent witty and contains a very sweet love story for those romantic types out there  it is one of the few films this summer that actually makes you think,black_comedy
jim carrey couldnt have asked for a better role to express his dramatic side  we watch truman burbank for two hours and although its only a movie we become part of the tv audience sitting on the edge of our seats wondering how it will end peter weir creates a world that seems unreal but in truth isnt far from reality in world of mtvs real world and jerry springer exposes we have begun to crave voyeurism isnt about truman its about society,black_comedy
i saw yesterday and im still under its spell i really liked this movie im not a fan of carrey as the matter of fact i dont like his movies at all but he is very fine as truman burbank i dont understand the movielovers on these pages who say that this film is overrated it really isnt intelligence has nothing to do with liking this movie but it does have to do with giving stupid comments and saying that people who dont like this movie are intelligent what kind of selfesteem is that,black_comedy
the idea for the show was great but they did not take it far enough  at times the story seemed bland and jim carey could have had a better performance  the director should have let him go with the character,black_comedy
i would say that is one of the best movies come out of hollywood in a long time in a day when most hollywood companies are sinking to crude sex and action scenes here is a film that will make you think of course im sure everybody by now knows the plot so i wont describe it in detail but i will discuss peter weir wrote and directed this film and im beginning to think he could be a new person in a new line of directors because many of his films have been just like that the concept of putting an unwanted baby into a show filled with perhaps thousands of actors and hundreds of product placements is something i have never heard of before if you wonder how truman burbank as he is called could be so gullible youre doing the same thing everyday just refer to cristofs line in his interview in the middle after truman met his father he said that we accept the reality of the world in which we live its as simple as that it really is as simple as that,black_comedy
without a doubt the best film of the years originality beautiful set design and wonderful performances by jim carrey and ed harris set this films standards far beyond anyone else ever imagined jim carreys performance was so heartfelt innocent and powerful that if the film stunk his performance would carry it throughout the film ed harris performance as the deranged director of davidtz is very creepy and entertaining from beginning to end this film is pure entertainment and emotions that will have you think about the film for months on end,black_comedy
this film has a touch of magic and its something new jim carrey is excellent and this is maybe the best film ever but i dont know because im still stunned10 out of 10 what more can i sayspeechless,black_comedy
there are two types of moviegoers people who like this movie and intelligent peoplewhat gives you the right to pass judgement on other people and infer that theyre idiots just because they like something that you dont i saw this exact comment about another movie here on the imdb i cant remember what movie it was or who made the commentit could have been you im tired of seeing people so swallowed up in what they think is quality that they shoot down other people if they dont conform to their opinions beauty is in the eye of the beholder,black_comedy
i went into this film not knowing what to expect  what i didnt expect was funny man jim carrey to keep his trade mark rubber face looking quite human in fact he is great in this is a well made emotional affecting film  it really makes you think about the world that you perceive as real i cant help thinking though that without a hollywood star in the main role would never have been successful  are audiences really that fickle,black_comedy
how will it endwere tuning into our tv sets attending movie theaters like never before logging on and reading serial fiction to keep us entertained  its all one big show so dont tell us the ending we dont want it spoiled for us  we cant wait to see how this one turns out  somewhere in all this entertainment is the gem that enlightens us about the human condition most of it is simply mindless drivel that babysits us with a neat and tidy resolutionthat can be the first while perfectly embodying our entertainedtodeath society only begins to demonstrate its brilliance  truman burbank jim carrey in his best performance to date has been the star of one big tv show all his life  after over 10000 days alive truman suspects something strangely synchronous and deadening about his existence hes never left his picture perfect life in seahaven the hometown where everyones either a principal or an extra and where the eponymous star of the show is intensely real simply because he doesnt know any better  but the naturalism falls short on trumans cohorts and even on the star himself  everyones been overly friendly and uniform out of obligation to the master plan  truman was adopted by a corporation at birth who turned every moment of his existence into a financial venture and entertainment empire  24hour continuous tv has to be commercial free so truman is surrounded by meticulous and sometimes blunt product placementlets face it  were all whores to the corporate world  at some point or another every one of us has paid too much to support a dominant corporation or to join its clique   celebrities and entrylevel actors reap the benefits after donating their soul to endorsements  but the price can be steep  does michael jordan really have private space anymore  and what about the millions of americans who can only really strike a chord with their peers through simpsons or xfiles references ,black_comedy
the beginning first 30 minutes is excellent then appears something like a very silly philosophy god is a tv producer of course in is good one although that can guide you to dude of his production first good film for carey,black_comedy
yes is a great movie which is similar to the 1960s cult tv series the prisoner in terms of plot and style this movie shows what jim carrey can do with the right guidance unlike his other forgettable roles but the movie could have been improved if it was longer to show what happens when truman enters the real world a parody could have been made between the life of princess diane and truman as the cameras would not be secret anymore and people will see him as someone famous and treat his privacy accordingly in the real world imagine the problems this would have caused,black_comedy
this clever film from the director of witness and the mosquito coast is surprisingly effective in presenting a pretty important message  by now everyone knows the premise of the story young mans entire life captured on live television without his knowledge  of course cracks begin to show especially when a lamp from the top of the huge dome that represents trumans fictional world falls to the street  its later revealed to truman on his car radio that a plane has been shedding its parts in flight  i found myself thinking of celebrities even of jim carrey himself who are constantly harassed with cameras and tv exposure  this is the hidden message of the movie because truman is the victim of television exploitation without approval which is wrongdont expect an overthetop performance by carrey who does a good job of balancing the characters mildness and his insanity while discovering the weirdness that surrounds him  one question remains unanswered throughout the film  does truman actually have sex with the costar who plays his wife ,black_comedy
this movie was wonderful the score was haltingly beautiful as well movie made me think and ed harris was wonderful as well jim carrey should win a lot of awards for this one but the academy loves tom hanks so he will probably get everything but jim you have got my vote finally a movie about a funnyman who makes a drama film and it is a great transition dont get me wrong i still will watch his comedy way to go jim and i recommend this movie to everyone,black_comedy
the movie as entertaining and imaginative as it was still allowed the viewer room to use their own imagination to fill in  the blanks the movie fed you just the right amount of info to satisfy but still left room for imagination could have easily gone to 3 hours in length excellent combo good movie,black_comedy
besides everyone said in the past jim carrys films sucks he sucks ive always enjoyed his movies except the cable guy i went to see this movie because of carrey and because of the success of this movie in the usa when i watched the movie it felt like if i was watching a tv show about a guy that was fooled all his life the movie is about a guy that always had his life manipulated by a tv crew and a man cristoff all the persons he knows he loves he talks are actors and only he doesnt know but things get messed up when he finds out what his life is about this movie will probably get an oscar for best acting and maybe a best movie fighting with saving private ryan the only thing that let me down in this movie was the final scene the last three minutes but still was a good end for a movie 95 out of 10 the 05 was taken off because i thought this movie should have more emotional stuff,black_comedy
all i can say is thank you mr weirthank you for letting jim carrey show more of his register thank you for making this movie,black_comedy
before i went to watch this movie i was filled with doubt jim carrey in a dramatic role impossible well it seems that i was terribly mistaken his acting is wonderful as well as ed harris the story is marvellous and it seems that peter weir made the movie perfect from all aspects i give it a 10 out of 10,black_comedy
we are in a new year now and we have a whole new batch of movies coming but for 1998 was the best saving private ryan is what most people would say was the best but i didnt see it  dont ask me howanyway the movie is just fabulous i was a carrey fan until a talk show when he said he was worth millions of dollars but doing some picture for ten thousand i dont remember what movie but this movie reassured me that he was a great actori state on every review almost that i am young but a big movie fan and can recognize a good movie when i see it and this movie is awesomenot only the best of 1998 but one of the best ever when the afi reissues another top 100 if they do that is this will be in the top ten if not number one,black_comedy
let me go on a point by point basis in discussing this piece of dreck this film sickened me to the point that i have to write a review for posterity so that they will know how bad it really is peter weirdead poet society his only good film the rest forgettable jim careyfirst saw him in once bitten  he played the character straight he can act its just that this performance is not worthy of any award ed harris i defy any of you to name one film in which this man has played anyone other than himself he plays a character that would only be believable if this were a farce his character is so unnaturally evil am i suppose to believe in this film that his character is so obsessed that he is crushed when a fellow human being wants to be free and what is with the hand gestures i want everyone to pay attention to his hand gestures almost homoerotic in a way if this were done on purpose it might be funny might be fitting its that method acting isnt it the woman who plays his love interestone wordterrible her face is shot in such an annoying way it is almost unbearable to watch plot if you are going to do social satire with a moral dilemma it must be believableie a clockwork orange film and novel 1984 novel and network film you cannot do a star wars treatment to a supposedly serious film for example we are supposed to believe that a man in his early thirties has been on film for his entire life 1 if he were born sometime in the sixties the technology simply would not be available to carry on with this charade 2 and most importantly as bad as we are as human beings i cannot believe that any of you would allow this to happen to a person therefore what is the point of this film it doesnt make me think of anything other than hollywood made a great deal of money off of us and we are starting to appreciate the sh that they give us so now that stanley kubrick has died where are we the only thing that i can think of is that i am going to have to start making movies i cant be any worse than these guys,black_comedy
i didnt really like it was really boring there was not enough actionthe main characters names are truman burbanks meryl burbanks syliva and marlon they were played by jim carrey laura linney natasch mcelhone noah ennmerichtruman was a child born into a world fill of actors and he never found out till he was about 30yrs old that his whole world was false he was the star of a world wide reality tv programi could tell that the director wanted to make something original and different i think the director achieved this,black_comedy
i watched this movie on tv and was looking for something a lot better it had received a lot of support when it was in the cinema both from the critics and the general public after watching it i wonder how it was given such high rating i am not a fan of jim carrey but i know that he has a lot of talent mainly in the comedy field i dont know which is worse this movie or the cable man however i do hope that this canadian talent is not wasted and he is given some better scripts at many points in the movie i was just at a loss what was going on watching a third or fourth rerun of murder she wrote would  have been a better option,black_comedy
the movie was generally bad  the story was understandable but it wasnt particularly interesting or enjoyablequite pointless if you ask me there were no particular funny scenes    jim carreys dumb and dumber is so much more entertaining   the movie seemed more like an unrealistic drama that just wasnt fun or catchy  the only good thing to say about the movie is that the more serious acting from jim carrey was impressive and the cinematography was effective   dont bother with this film   if you want an excellent black comedy try the one of a kind bride of chucky,black_comedy
this movie was one of the worst movies that i have seen in a long time  the lack of a storyline in the beginning and the slowness of the movie provided a very boring movie  by the time the storyline became evident i was falling asleep and then had trouble keeping my eyes open for the remainder of the movie  i was told that the end of the movie was the best part however if you cannot get through the beginning the movie is just not worth watching  jim carreys role was a good one but it would have been a better character if they had casted a more talented actor  i feel that the movie could have had great potential but bombed out due to lack of acting and a weak storyline,black_comedy
yeah i saw this movie and was looking forward to it  but the whole performance of the concept disappointed me about half way through i wished it was going to finish thento stop this embarrassing farce,black_comedy
when this film came out i was really excited to see it because people were calling it the greatest film of all time etcetc yet when i went to see it i was probably the most depressed person i swear that was the worst movie of the year not the best as people were saying if you are a big film like i am do not go see this awful piece of garbage,black_comedy
and since its a movie i felt ripped off dull and predictable a real winning combination i walked out of this dreck after about an hour i finally caught the whole thing on video  and believe it didnt improve with age,black_comedy
there are just a few things which i feel that dont fit with the premise of the story first of all i feel that the musical score should reflect how truman is feeling rather than the fictional characters who are viewing i also think that the part of the story when truman is unaware that hes on a tv show should have been extended in length i dont know the name of the lens where the viewer sees just a circle of the screen but i dont think it should have been used if the camera was positioned to make the viewer think something was wrong but not be quite sure i think it would have been better i think that soley unique camera angles would produce an awesome effect and a greater wha moment when we realize truman is on a show overall i think that if the film were done in a slightly more surreal manner rather than its current straightforward nature it would be more interesting,black_comedy
is the american audience so ignorant that they can truly believe that such a poorly directed movie which is nothing more than an interesting bit of coffee table philosophy could be a revolutionary cinematic conceptjim carrey should stick to low brow facial acting and leave the real acting to real actors though his comedic performance was the most entertaining aspect of the 2hours i wasted on this movie it did not make the grade this was nothing but a thinly veiled concept movie with a big name actor to railroad it into the hearts of americans if you want to see a movie which has depth in which all the elements of cinematic excellence come together to form a cohesive film try something like brazil or reading 1984  that was a bad movie try to find a movie without the feel good american perspective where the director is afraid to alienate the ignorant,black_comedy
this film had a good premise but it failed miserably to develop it the characters were all over the placejim carreys acting was the only redeeming feature the ending was particularly bad with people who lived for truman cheering his escape though it means they will have nothing to do,black_comedy
this movie reeks  im too busy kicking myself to go any deeper than that,black_comedy
i disliked the movie it wasnt an interesting movie i found it boring even though jim carrey played the part well the movie was boringthe main characters are truman burbankjim carreymeryl burbanklaura linelymarlonnoah emmerontrumans fatherbrian delatetrumans motherholland tayloryoung trumanblair slateri think the director was trying to get the idea across that you have to adventure to find out things about your selfi think that the film has its funny moments but it is hard to put in a genre because it was a weird movie unlike nearly all of jim carreys other movies like the mask and fun with dick and jane,black_comedy
all i heard was how original this movie was original try a rip off of an old twlight zone episode the characters had no pathos it boggles my mind why do people love this movie its not worth the price of the film it was printed on,black_comedy
thye whole point of the film is that truman is the only one who is unaware that since his birth he has been on tv and that all the other people are actors truman is married did he ever have sex with his wife or ids he still a virgin when he sees children walking about did he not wonder where they came from or did he he sex with his actress wife this above all else is what spoils the story completely for me he never wanted to go on holiday to france or to hawaii he never once wanted to leave town find out who his real parents were if possible lastly why would any government especially the usa let this type of thing happen its totally against human rights and everyone involved with the project should have been put in jail hype made this picture popular and some high brow reviewers,black_comedy
from bafta winning and oscar and golden globe nominated directed peter weir witness dead poets society this is a fantastic satirical drama comedy film with a great comedy star taking on a more dramatic turn the film begins with an interview with christof golden globe and oscar and bafta nominated ed harris winning creator of the highly popular reality show called along with cast members hannah gill playing trumans wife meryl laura linney and his best friend noah noah emmerich then we get to the main story where since birth truman burbank golden globe winning jim carrey has been the star of the show only he doesnt know it and he has lived in his fictional town filled with an all actors cast on day 10909 a tv camera suddenly falls from the sky and later on character lauren played by sylvia natascha mcelhone tries to tell him that everything is fake and everyone is pretending very slowly more peculiar things happen to make him believe he is part of something eg his wife promoting products he sees his dad who he saw die the radio broadcasts his movement he sees a film crew where the elevator is meant to be characters circling the block and when he tries to get away everything the makers can think of are stopping him the network is the first to legally adopt a child they have 5000 cameras watching trumans every moment from the mundane to the monumental they gave truman a fear of water when his dad drowned and they have no intention on ending but when they think they have sorted everything bringing back trumans father brian delate truman tricks the camera and escapes but not before they find him sailing away from the town they attempt to scare and stop him with a storm but he continues till eventually he reaches the studio edge ie the sky christof talks to him for the first time when he sees the staircase and exit and has a little heart to heart to try and make him stay and when he asks him to say something because hes live to the whole world truman says his catchphrase in case i dont see ya good afternoon good evening and good night and finally leaves also starring holland taylor as trumans mother paul giamatti as control room director spinal taps harry shearer as mike michaelson and bruce almightys philip baker hall as network executive it was nominated the oscar for best writing screenplay written directly for the screen it won the baftas for best production design best original screenplay and the david lean award for direction and it was nominated for best film best cinematography and best special effects and it won the golden globe for best original score for burkhard von dallwitz and philip glass and it was nominated for best motion picture  drama and best screenplay  motion picture jim carrey was number 47 on the 100 greatest movie stars outstanding,black_comedy
one of the best movies before highly recommended to watch when it comes to drama and a bit of suspense,black_comedy
is one of the unique movie i watched  in this movie we can see the power of media over the life of humans were in it can control you  in this movie we can also see on how people use technologies or media to manipulate people power and money,black_comedy
the movie is so great it makes people laugh alot and make people so confuse about what happen at the end but it is still great because they have pick the cast appropriately,black_comedy
this movie the it was so great to watch you can learn alot it can make you laugh in any ways the cast was chosen appropriately that makes the movie more interesting and funny,black_comedy
christof wanted to be god so he made this universetruman is a mirror of us who dont vare about the truth but when he has wanted to know it he didat the final scene when truman opened the door we saw black color behind itthat is our real universe,black_comedy
this movie was provokingthe casting of the movie is clearhowever the plotting of the story is not clear for me because the ending is not intriguing despite i like the way it capture for the scene and videography,black_comedy
the smartest funniest most original hollywood movie in agesits pleasant funny without being obviously so and nonpushy theres an amazing shot of christof stroking an enormous television screen broadcasting an image of truman asleep as if he were god himself reviewing his handiwork,black_comedy
this movie was fantastic i was really amazed on how they do it on how they portrayed their characters on how they gave life to the movie for me this is one of the best movies ive watched,black_comedy
thus movie is not bad i mean its good but the ending is i dont know you should have done better,black_comedy
jim carreys performance is so impactful that it bring tears in eyes the story and screenplay is its main hero the concept is spectacular,black_comedy
loved it amazing storybrilliantly written and a very satisfying end definately one of the better movies of its time,black_comedy
theres a lot to discuss about the film i wonder why there are some who rated below 7,black_comedy
one of the smartest most inventive movies in memory it manages to be as endearing as it is provocative,black_comedy
if anyone wanna suicide go watch it first and then try to suicidethank me later for saving your lifeand yes im a psychologist,black_comedy
really hit the nail on the head in terms of where our culture was headed its crazy that this came out in 1998 and it guessed that reality tv and social media and 247 self obsession would become the norm jim carrey is fantastic in this and so is ed harris as the puppetmaster pulling the strings,black_comedy
as a viewer i thoroughly enjoyed the comical satirical element to this film was a captivating source of entertainment as the main character truman goes through his life unknowingly living a double life in the lovely town of sea haven seahaven is a town that is portrayed as picture perfect in fact the set of a tv show as a dramatic set of events occur truman starts to uncover some clues and test his boundaries with things i liked this movie because it always kept you on your feet with what is going to happen next multiple times throughout you just want to cheer on the underdog to unveil his ignorance and help him be enlightened of what is happening other times you are chanting on the other side wanting the story to continue i would definitely want to watch this movie again and recommend it to other people due to its creative story line and way to portray the message they are trying to get across director peter wehr and writer andrew niccol do a fantastic job developing this concept and displaying it on the big screen,black_comedy
i hate jim carrey comedies i just find its humor too childish too simple i know hollywood payed him very well to behave in the films like he did fortunately jim carry demonstrated to be an actor with more pretensions than doing always the same role as a result he made this spectacular moviethe movie is funny and at some points jim carry behaves like kim carrey but the film is far more than the stupid comedies in which he acted beforetruman is the biggest attraction to spectators all over the world he was born in a cinema studio he is property of the studio and his life is transmitted all over the world the best of all reality shows a real life on tv he has a father mother friends  all actors but truman who suspects nothing about the deception but suddenly things begin to work the wrong way truman would love to travel abroad and some members of the cast began to remorse about what they are doing ,black_comedy
the trueman show could be a warning through film similarly to the wizard of oz and how that was used to tell a more important story and is not merely entertainment but a warning to humanity if we are prepared to see it the trueman show is one example of many other films sending out this warningtruman burbank represents the people while the actors bystanders friends and family of truman on the ground are the gatekeepers of the illuminate who are hiding in the hollowed out moon the audience may be alien intelligence who in the movie some of which get on the set inside trumans world to interact with truman could be representative of aliens interacting with us watching us from another dimension or from above or might just be us the viewers looking into the looking glass tvhis name says a lot and is like an overview of the whole meaning trueman is true  man  truth for man while burbank is bur pricklythorn  bank moneypower  corrupt elite or illuminate therefore truman v burbank  right v wrong or good v bad etci believe the warning could be to inform the people who are prepared to see it for what it really is that if we can overcome our fear of living we can set ourselves free from the illusion of our controlled reality and if we dont then we remain in bondage as shown in the movie where trueman overcomes his fear of the water water represents the essence of all life so he fears life or living to eventually escape at the edge of his prison trumans fear of the water was constructed through events orchestrated by his controllers and is a mirror of how humanity has been left in a state of fear through controlled and manipulated staged eventsthere is a screen shot of a view that appears to be a pyramid and is one of many examples of illuminate symboling used in the movie truman is in his car at the bottom of the pyramid to get to the top he has to overcome his fear of the water by crossing the bridge the sign post on the right looks like a police badge outline which is a reminder of control and the light at the top of the lamp post representing the eye the long yellow line in the middle could be a reference to the yellow brick road from the wizard of ozandrew niccol the producer and writer of also directed and was the writer for gattaca made one year before which has an interesting link as this is about how to overcome and beat the ptb in an orwellian society through overcoming fear to achieve the ultimate goal for the main character vincent freeman of escaping earth which is the same goal for truman burbank,black_comedy
a beautiful movie the movie was a little confused at first but later on the unusual and beautiful film jim carrey on the screen throughout the entire film support roles have helped the film and the film dragged as the movie progresses turned out to be an interesting topic hide much in the way of jobs in a place where everything is as it seems in fact a movie about that i didnt watch another movie about it so i was very impressed and can not be a movie about this topic better what scares me who lives thrown into the story without the knowledge of the whole world in front of a younger wants to live,black_comedy
what if everything was not as it seemed what if you were constantly under watch by everyone you know its hard to imagine but in it covers just that truman burbank lives in a fake world his friends and family are actors he is a walking advertisement everything he does it noted down but he doesnt have a single clue in this gripping comedydrama the script writer andrew niccol gives you an insight into what it would be like to never have privacy truman burbank played by the hilarious jim carrey is in his late 30s his positive outlook on life and his happy personality make him vulnerable and unexpecting of everything around him his whole life is censored she has no idea of his celebrity status so as you can imagine finding out his own secret would lead to severe reactions and consequences this film with its staggering earnings of 125 million dollars is different to your stereotypical movie there are no big monsters no damsels in distress just your everyday man with a big story i would call this film though provoking interesting and tense there are many opinions as to whether this paramount production has a suitable ending but mine would be yes it does i feel that often when watching films if there is an undecided ending the film becomes more personal to you because you can let yourself imagine the ending who knows if there would ever be a show like this in real life perhaps here would be as culture becomes worse and people have less morals although is an individual and creative film i think that perhaps the script leaves something to be desired maybe it could have delved deeper into what some of the actors were feeling but still a very tense and gripping film jim carreys performance shows that he can act much better than most think challenging himself with more diverse roles although some people believe jim carrey to be a comedyonly actor in the film you see a much more emotional side to his acting has a surreal feel to it often the light seems too bright the moon too perfect or the clouds too fluffy it really adds to the film making it seem even more like a fake world than it already did but to be honest even though i still have some criticism about i couldnt stop watching it its truly edge of your seat stuff and there is never really a boring scene or a dull moment overall i give this film a 45 for its entertainment and i would recommend it to people of all ages,black_comedy
every minute and second of the day people are watching you you can nether trust anyone have you ever watched a film that changes the hole world truman doesnt know he is being watched and that his hole life is basted on tv shows he has got cams around him every day afternoon and night all of the actors in this show can not be trusted since truman was just a baby he was on the show i know right very unfair truman nether really had a real family he was brought up by the actors in the show his real parents did not want him so thats were the director of got him from is truly amazing you must see it my options to this show is that its a really good show the hole town knows truman and thats cool but also weird also that it is a very amusing show to watch it makes you want to watched it over and over again he is trapped in this fake world he doesnt know it at first but when he comes across some clues he begins to know truman decides to try to escape he is a nice man who has got a job and a house but the only thing wrong with his life is that it is all fake he also has a fake wife that doesnt care less about truman she gets a bit scared when truman begins to know all that he should know the whole world is watching his every move even when he is eating will truman ever escape well you have got to find out and watch to find out truman is upset when he finds out that he is being watched and very angry so he goes  bonkers and trys to escape from the fake world that he has been living in for the last 32 years this is my rating for 5 stars out of 5 stars it is truly this good of a show if you do not watch this show then you will miss out big timethis is a picture of the director in the film he was the one who made up his whole life it was his idea it is his show and he knows that it isnt far to truman to keep him trapped up in his fake little world with the actors in will truman ever escape,black_comedy
every once in a while a movie comes along that challenges every aspect of routine filmmaking a movie which has never been done before is one such movie the whole concept of truman burbank which i will not spoil for you guys is without a doubt an idea that i never saw before in a film jim carrey who plays him is at his very best we all know him as a really big comedy star but theres a reason hes in the business hes in dude is a great actor ed harris is fantastic in a supporting role which more or less is pivotal to the entire story and the sets built are magical the movie itself is magical the best film of 1998 one of the best of the decade peter weirs best film and a perennial classic that will hit on many issues,black_comedy
truman burbank is an ordinary guy in an ordinary little seaside town of seahaven island where nothing really happens everything is clean everything is perfect he knows people but never really connects to anyone the one woman he ever really loved is not his wife and has long since left for the other side of the world where he longs to visit but feels he can never go we are shown that every turn he makes every attempt to escape is blocked by malevolent simulators and high tech manipulators intent on keeping him inside he is watched 24 hours a day seven days a week and his life televised as a form of entertainment paralyzed by his fear of water since seeing his father die on a boating accident truman still feels he is missing something a strange light falling from the sky a man who reminds him of his dead father a strange radio broadcast and the feeling that the world really stops when he shuts his eyes all combine to make him feel something is wrongsome of the positive aspects of the film are that truman is a well looked after person he is treated kindly by everyone and has been given a normal life to live in ive given truman the chance to live a normal life says christoff relationships with our family and friends are the most important thing we see this through times when truman is upset or needs help he goes to his mum and best friend marlon for support and they help him out his mum talks him through his problems and acts like a normal mum would while marlon settles his problems over a 6 pack of beers the audience also has something to watch on television live for the whole world to see 24 hours a day 7 days a week people watch as truman goes through his everyday life christoff makes money and the audience have a show they enjoy watchingsome of the negative aspects of the film are that truman never actually had a family he is trapped inside a fake world town of seahaven where every single person except him are actors and he begins to become aware of the situation he is in he is being misled into believing the lies that have been constructed for him to keep him unaware of the real events occurring around him we realise that trumans wife is just an actor playing a role in which she was placed she had no real emotional feelings for truman she is just playing the role of his wife and so trumans sense of love and relationship is distorted whenever truman tries to go someplace far he is always blocked from the sudden masses of traffic to the apparent nuclear meltdown truman can never escape and will be trapped inside a fake world until he finally has enough faces his fears and sails a boat into the horizon overall this is a great film about truman trying to find his way into the real world when everything seems like it doesnt add up it just keeps getting more complicated for him in the end truman couldnt handle it anymore and the will to live couldnt be quashed by anything not even television good morning and in case i dont see ya good afternoon good evening and good nightthe truman show,black_comedy
truman burbank leads a normal life he wakes up and goes to a normal job kissing his normal wife goodbye and greeting all of the normal people in his normal little town however i cannot say that is normal far from it it is the originality and uniqueness of this film that makes it so memorable one day after years of this ordinary life he decides he wants to take action and actually gain experiences to have an adventure or two the problem is that as much as he tries everything is getting in his way that is when he becomes suspicious about why the world seems to be revolving around his life all of this pointing to the fact that he is being watched around the clock by the entire world this is one of those movies that sticks with you long after the credits and as you drive to work the next morning you will be careful to avoid smashing the camera on your windshield,black_comedy
as a fan of the twilight zone series i could easily see the influences from that series into this film i knew that the motion picture of that series failed and i was a little worried at first but to my surprise i was blown away i havent seen such a bizarre idea be the main story of a film since transformers  however that film wasnt good in bizarre i dont mean dumb or stupid but more like interesting and boy is it interesting this opening is different to most films ive seen it shows the cast of the actors characters acting in an interview which is good because it is already treating itself like a movie and unlike truman they all know theyre being watched in the beginning of the film you get to see lots of product placement when truman is saying hello to his neighbors it shows the ideal neighbor then when truman meets the twins one of them pushes him in front of a poster which shows some sort of chicken dinner later in the day he is in the garden when his lover shows him a brand new kitchen knife and showing all the features like a commercial and also when your introduced to his best friend who is drinking a beer and says now thats a beer or something like that one thing i noticed about this film is that it is very smart like when a light falls from the sky they later say that it was a part of an airplane well since hes always being watched the director can make sure truman doesnt suspect anything and i should be more specific in that this director is smart i saw that this was listed under comedy which i didnt get at first but if the point was to be satirical then it did a perfect job my last thoughts i think this is a very unique film with its ideas and great characters and think that anybody would be interested in this film,black_comedy
this movie makes you think about the alternate possible realities of life though it is quite different from matrix jim carrey plays a character named truman who is the subject of a 247 live reality show without his knowledge for the viewer this unravels gradually through explicit sequences as well as implicit weirdness of the happenings in his life later in the movie the whole reality is described in a crisp manner which makes you just wonderthe weirdness of his world is decoded by truman himself which finally leads to a heart moving climax at that point i just wished the movie to be a little longer so that i could see his life in the real world i truly admire the nuances and intricacies of the framework which essentially determine the directorial stylethumbs up even i am surprised how jim was not even nominated by the academy that year,black_comedy
the story tells you how a person was always on the television and he didnt even knew it the story in the starting will confuse you a little bit but then as it slowly progress it is going to take a firm grasp on you as if you want the guy to know the truth jim carey is best in acting roles like this and he did his job very nicely initially if you will think of the films story then you are bound to laugh at the weird concept but the way it is presented to you is commendable one thing that looks too stupid all the time is the question which is where is the government how is an innocent man from his childhood is being made a mockery but i must say the concept was weird but it was fun to watch thisa must watch for all,black_comedy
a great movie with a funny and a little bit of sad storythink about it you learn that your life is just a showbillions of people watching every move of you and you dont know it is showyou live 30 years in a studiobut that isnt just sadtruman burbank is a very friendly and funny man and his actions makes you laughmy favorite thing in this movie is trumans catchphrase  good morning and in case i dont see ya good afternoon good evening and good night the movie wont make you cry because like i sad the only sadness in this movie is in the storythey made the movie in 1998 but i watched it a couple months agoim telling you if you didnt see this movie then what are you waiting for,black_comedy
is about the ultimate conspiracy a conspiracy that can actually pull it off for 30 years of this mans life creating a make believe world where nothing is even close to what it looks like and it is believable in trumans world about 5000 cameras are positioned around the gigantic set although the governmentiswatchingyouscare is now less than it used to be our lives are becoming more and more public not in the least because of this great internet but mainly because media is bringing everyone much closer to each other and giving us the opportunity to know much more than before making information available on every subject possible what then can assure us that eventually our lives will not be like trumans one big show for everyone to see and fake from the bottom up,black_comedy
if you cant give something 1010 to what can you this is an excellent film in so many ways its heartwarming inspiring and tearjerking at times i was going to give it a 9 but this is exactly what movies should be about originality ambition great directing  acting and an immersion into a world built up within it truman show has all those qualities this is something that has never been done before those of you who want to take something philosophical away from this film and look into it deeply will find you can do just that its deep enough to incite thought and those of you who just want to sit through a feelgood movie with a few twists and turns that will leave you gripped need look no further i think this was the first time we saw carrey shy away from comedy and although there are parts of his humour that shine through the film is all the better for it he plays this part perfectly right through to its epic climax his humour is not utilised in this film to give his center stage and an open floor to be as silly as he can instead this film allows you to laugh with him and not feel as if youre watching a standup show the rest of the cast are perfect fitting in well including ed harris as the director he surprised me here because he is just the right amount of his usual badass self mixed with some emotion and empathy this is definitely an original concept and executed well i havent seen this film in a few years yet still remember much of it you wont be disappointed,black_comedy
i used the last days of december to watch some films that had impressed me about a decade ago the film was among them around 2000 i watched several times and tried to analyze its contents like many modern movies it contains an ambiguous message obviously the leading theme is the obtrusive invasion of our private life by the producers of television programs the common life of individual people is transformed into entertainment not just in the form of a single commentary but by means of regular weekly or even daily broadcastings at the time this type of entertainment was still a novelty i even remember that shortly after a similar film about the topic was released titled edtv since 2000 the socalled reality tv has become a common vehicle of entertainment probably because it is cheap and doesnt require any careful considerations nevertheless has withstood the ravages of time and still succeeds in fascinating me at the time i interpreted the story as a critique on the unwanted invasion of your private living space by unknown outsiders for passerbys clearly and intentionally block burbanks passage when he is in a hurry both in a hospital on the sidewalk or in the file on the highway during a chance meeting a cop unexpectedly happens to know his name when burbank wishes to visit the fijis the posters in the local traveling agency try to instil a fear for flying and the flights to the fijis happen to be fully booked for at least a month burbank discovers that in an eternal procession the same group of strangers circulates around his house as a whole the chance of an accidental conjunction of circumstances becomes negligible and burbank logically concludes that it is all premeditated the only surprise is his slowness in the uptake considering that he had already been encysted for thirty years since his birth in the end burbank succeeds in escaping from his artificial repressing and hostile world but now after another ten years i doubt that this is really the leading theme for we live in a world where you can simply watch the home life of your neighbors by infiltrating their computer through the net and controlling their webcam by means of spyware and if you can not do this your government or an ict firm certainly can apparently is not so much a protest against a threatening future big brother society after the narration of the totalitarian society by george orwell as a warning against the actual way of living that develops around us thus the story becomes a hotchpotch of undesirable developments for instance the intrusion of advertising in our lives or the social encysting and gossiping in the small community perhaps even the oppression by social conventions in general or the spying by the state and enterprises on their citizens and costumers which in the professed age of terrorism has become unbounded apparently the narrative of is more a shower of grains of shot than a welltargeted critique so although i still appreciate the film and its invitation to ponder it is clearly not the monument of resistance that i presumed twelve years ago a pity disappointing,black_comedy
i recently read about a syndrome that involves people who come to believe that they are the star of their own reality tv show they believe that they alone are the center of the universe and everyone and everything that comes in contact with them exist for their own personal benefit and enjoyment this isnt exactly the idea behind but it was close as truman burbank jim carrey was born and raised as a corporate entity and marketed to the world as the central character of a thirty year old twenty four hour a day living soap opera i guess the picture did the best job it could of providing the viewer with the rationale needed to make this concept work like throwing up roadblocks in trumans youth to steer him to certain conclusions about life and its limitations on closer examination however some of those foundations begin to crumble one of the biggest plot holes for me involved trumans marriage to meryl laura linney even though presented with a simulated wedding photo showing meryls fingers crossed my thoughts proceeded to the honeymoon and the consummation of their marriage how did truman rationalize beyond that point to where the story picks up for us still in an age of realty tv and celebrity this and that with the stars it was probably only a matter of time before a subject like this was tackled for a provocative film treatment i wouldnt put it past any large corporation on the scale say of exxon mobil or general electric to jump the shark and participate in something as totally over the top as and sadly i see no small amount of willing participants eager to sell their souls for a brief moment of fame glory and wealth why ill bet theres someone out there who would be willing to stage an elaborate high profile courtship plan a big expensive wedding and then get divorced after only seventy two days im just saying,black_comedy
when it came out i remember thinking of as just a jim carrey vehicle  little more than an announcement than he had decided to be a dramatic actor now perhaps because of that conclusion i didnt watch it until recently the movie is actually pretty good and carreys casting is more than just a cold bid for box office dollars over picking the actor best suited for the rolethe premise which oddly is much more relevant in 2011 than when the movie was made in 1998 when reality tv was in its infancy is that carreys character truman burbank has been raised inside a gigantic television set and every moment of his life has been broadcast on television to a mostly adoring public he is a television sensation interacting with actors and extras in a carefully controlled world and has a sort of goofy sitcom way of conducting himself complete with catch phrases that is perfect for the show he doesnt even know hes staring in this sort of goofy everyman angle actually helps explain why such a show could become popular and is perfect for an actor like jim carrey who might very well be described as a goofy everymanof course everything starts to unravel and the film becomes about if truman will escape from his constructed world or if he will even want to we follow his travails along with cristoff ed harris the diabolical creator of the world but also through numerous fans of the show a real cast of average joes and janes we also learn about lauren natasha mcelhone who infiltrated the world briefly and is trumans true love interest but was whisked away by the producers and is involved in a apparently unpopular movement to free trumanliving in a mediacentric world its hard to not find the premise and possibilities of the story intriguing even fascinating it makes for compelling drama and the comedy is just fun enough to not be annoying but the reason to see this is the story not the jokesthe movie works i found myself wishing theyd let him interact with his world more instead of thrusting predetermined life events on him wouldnt it have been more interesting and less likely to fail if theyd given him some more freedom to live his own life i also wish the movie had explained a bit better why the life of an insurance salesman could be so interesting  much of it would seemingly be pretty boring daily routine no doubt his otherwise monotonous days were scripted with plenty of amusing events but we never actually saw any of thesethe movie has obvious philosophical and even theological themes but is not anything dramatically deep ill forgive it for that especially as it manages to be meaningful without being pretentiousis just a good premise told in a competent enough manner its one of the more original big budget big name films that hollywood has cranked out and it doesnt squander all of that potential this movie seems to have somehow fallen by the wayside a bit but now more than ever it should be quite enjoyable if you havent seen it before,black_comedy
we accept the reality of the world with which we are presented a film adequately summed up in one quote its an allegory on the influence of the media how films and tv shows and adverts are packaged and manipulated by those who are in a position to do so the message is strengthened here by carreys performance at a time when he was not known for dramatic roles and the character of truman himself who gives the film its emotional weight we want to see truman escape this world that he has been essentially trapped inside as do the audience of the show as we see them in the film however they also want their show to continue for them trumans life is not reality but catharsis ring any bells big brother survivor and the numerous other reality shows of the past ten years is one of the best films of its time,black_comedy
this film is about jim carey truman in a reality show which was created from the day he was born he goes though his life normally until a number of other actors want to tell him the truth that he is the star but he doesnt know the director creates this film intelligently it is like you are in jim careys position as the beginning is very confusing and you feel like truman when he starts uncovering the truth so do you this film was thought of very cleverly and it kept me into the film from start to finishi recommend this to everyone,black_comedy

is a completely original motion picture for good and for bad it is very different and a unique movie experiencein general is okay but far from perfection some moments are a bit boring it was directed by peter weir the same guy who directed dead poets societyis a movie which makes us question this what if my whole life was nothing more than just a realityshow what if my whole life was just a television program what if the whole world knew everything about me and my lifethats exactly what happens with the character truman burbank he doesnt know about this but as the movie runs he suspects that somethings wrong and slowly he finds out the truth he also finds out that even his wife his best friend marlon and most people he knows are actually hired actors however sylvia trumans dream woman is the only one who supports him and feels ashamed about what they are doing to trumanjim carrey does a great job as truman burbank however jim carrey is hilarious as usual in this movie but at the same time he does a very good job as a dramatic actor yes this was his first dramatic role ever which was a challenge for jim carrey but ended up as a victoryed harris is great as well in the role of the arrogant programs creator christof but the other actors do a good job eitherthis movie is distinguish for being so different and fresh but at the same time it has the power of letting me paranoid its notorious how after this movie came out lots of realityshows were made naturally inspired by this movies ideathis movie looks simple in many ways but it also has some amazing and original things a perfect sunset a nice and lovely town seahaven beautiful sceneries stunning views of seahaven surrounded by the sea the moon which is christofs studio different and good camera angles which give us the impression that truman is being watched including from the inside of the electronic climate controls of trumans car  somebody explain me how did they do that the rain falling on truman the incredible storm caused by christofs selfish orders and even that final part  when truman walks through the sea and christof talks to him from the sky that final part is so well made that we can consider it magicalby the way i cant finish my review without talking about the soundtrack this movie has brilliant and very smooth classical music by frdric chopin its so beautiful and wonderful besides theres plenty of more instrumental songs not classical however which are equally awesome and very relaxing to hear,black_comedy
reality tv shows whether its big brother shipwrecked or wife swap you either love them or hate them in our world wannabe contestants would give anything for their five minutes of fame whereas in this paramount pictures flick we have truman blissfully unaware that he is living in a fake reality and has become a global household nametruman burbank is a simple man with a simple life  he has a perfect wife and a fairytale home what more could you ask for right every day its the same thing greetings runofthemill insurance job corny commercial advertising and his never ending search for a lost love all desperate attempts to escape from the world of seahaven end in failure of course there is no escape the clues are all there stage lights falling from the sky even the radio talking to him whenever truman comes close to discovering the truth about his life all the evidence is buried under a clever web of tricks and lies from buttons to bowler hats secret cameras have been plastered all over the neighbourhood and theyre watching born a star trumans whole existence has been broadcast to the planet from womb to work in the largest tv stage set of all time actors create a trained community of friends lovers even relatives while the godlike christof ed harris gets to recite such lines as cue the sun while concealed in his spacious viewing office hidden behind the moon natascha mcelhone is cast as lauren trumans bona fide love quickly pulled from the show for attempting to tell truman his true identity trumans father brian delate was also cut from the show early on in a boating accident resulting in truman developing aqua phobia wier has managed to produce a small backbone cast so perfectly suited to their onscreen roles that you could say they were born to play them however these characters are only the framework of the movie giving the films major star jim carrey a chance to shine throughnaturally the success of this blockbuster hit would have been nothing without the presence of jim carrey and his leading role as truman in previous films carrey has delivered first class comedy performances resulting in nation wide admiration for his cringy ott comedies such as ace ventura and liar liar it doesnt matter if youve never liked him before in this film carrey has become a real human being for the first time and creates his character with powerful captivating emotions never seen before a masterfully moving performance with the perfect balance of humour and solemnity carrey deserves top marks for making one of the biggest films of the year films this great dont come along often clever funny and thought provoking this big hit blockbuster has it all you will never look at a reality tv show in the same way again,black_comedy
in this movie truman thought he was a normal man had an insurance job a beautiful wife neighbors and some friends at first but the truth is cruel trumen burbank is actually a wellknown leading character in a tv series called the trumen show all of his movements have been recorded by cameras sent to worldwide by satellites and at last shown by the tv monitor and have been seen by most of the people around the world having read the novel running out of time jessie keyser the young leading character in this book has the same situation with trumen living in clifton in 1840 she didnt know that many eyes have watched their life until her mom told the truth about the outside world in 1996 it just let me think about those celebrities they have been chased by some paparazzi since they became a focal point princess dianas accident might proved this some odious paparazzi no spies would saidthis is just my job for excuses this movie told us that the importance of the right of privacy and respectability to the others each person is an individual human being not just a toy or a monitoring object,black_comedy
this film literally changed my thoughts about reality television the nonviolent cruelty placed on truman is something that he doesnt realize will surprise you and truman doesnt notice he being cruelly treated the director of the show i forget who played him was excellent in his role as the man who would try to kill the thing that made him famous the roles are great but jim carrey however was superb in his role as the clueless celebrity who everyone stares at and this is a jim carrey film so you know its packed with laughs the funniest is when the director noticing trumans at the end of his little world is talking to him with a loud deep voice he sounds like god coming from the sky is hilarious its not flawless but its extremely good,black_comedy
truman burbank jim carrey who lives in a seemingly normal seaside town but what truman doesnt realize that his life is a nonstop tv show which the seaside town is actually a giant studio which is created by a visionary producerdirector ed harris which truman is only genuinely person in the show since his fictional wife laura linney his fake mother holland taylor and his false best friend noah emmerich are nothing more than hollywood actors truman is slowly realizing nothing what it seems to be in his life and theres more to discover outside this largely fictional seaside towndirected by peter weir gallipoli master and commanderthe far side of the world witness made an superb fantasy drama with touches of humour carrey is excellent in his change of pace role the cast are also good which includesnatascha mcelhone paul giamatti harry shearer and philip baker hall in small roles this was one of the biggest hits of 1998 the latest dvd edition dvd has an sharp anamorphic widescreen 1781 transfer and an gooddolby digital 51 surround sound dvd also included a two part featurette with the cast  crew special effects featurette deletedextended scenes and more harris received an oscar nomination for his supporting role since dennis hopper was originally cast in the part director weir was also nominated for best director the film is quite touching and very entertaining dont miss one of the most original movies of 1998 oscarnominated screenplay by andrew niccol gattaca s1mone ,black_comedy
lets just say that is one of the best films i have ever seen it has drama and it has comedywhat more can you want and hey it stars jim carey one of the greatest funny actors ever to act the film is basically about a guy called truman burbankjim carrey who is put into a town since he was a baby this town is actually a film set and everyone around him are all acting the whole world are watching on tv at his every move thats what i love about the film it has a great story it adds lots of suspense to the film where truman starts finding out that hes in a fake world created by a master genius christof my favourate part is where on the radio it starts saying everything he is doing and truman is getting suspicious it has great music at that part and puts suspense into the scene i like the way that the creators of the show made trumans father fall into the storm when he was on the boat because of that he doesnt like water at the end of the film he escapes by going into a boat across the water but no one looks for him there because he is scared of water when they see him in the water christof trys to stop him with any means necessary but in the end truman escapes and i love the line at the end where christof says say something your on tv to truman and truman replies if i dont see ya good afternoon good evening and good night and then he leaves its great it would have been better though if you could see what happens when he goes into the real world but oh well its still a great film the other funny part is where hes going mad in the car hes spinning around the roundabout in the car and shouts help me im being spontaneous i also love the way that he is in a perfect world created just for him its nothing like the real world its great i think that the creators of the film have done a fantastic job of making a film with a great storyline and a new concept completely different than other films well done excellent work,black_comedy
at the 71st annual academy awards in 1999 jim carey jokingly expressed his woe and despair for not receiving and acting nomination for his performance in humorous and goodnatured as it was i would not have been surprised if he actually felt that way and furthermore he would be right to his portrayal of a man trapped within his own perception of reality was more than deserving of a nomination and leads us once again to the ageold debate of the academy and its low success rate of selecting the most appropriate nominees and winnerstake a closer look and youll realize that the same lack of attention from the academy applies to the whole film let alone carey is one of the most stunningly original and creative films of the nineties a clever satire loaded with sharp wit and genuine drama from a carefully selected cast if it has any flaw it may be that it was too much of a clever satire flying over the heads of an audience which was strongly infatuated with reality televisionstill for the pictures innovation and genius to be overlooked by the academy which seems to be lost in its own perception of reality is inexcusable and unfair especially for jim carey who may never get another opportunity like this againintriguing and compelling deserved more respect than it got and still does today,black_comedy
this is a truly wonderful film from the direction by peter weir to the acting by jim carrey ed harris and the whole supporting cast it is in my personal top 20 list of all time favorite movies the character of truman truly grows throughout the film along with the suspension from reality truman begins to discover that all his life he has been in a show thats fake but oh so real peter weir dose a brilliant job of relating to his characters and the plot in my opinion i think this is one of jim careys bestand as i stated before the supporting cast is amazingi love this show within a movie and highly recommend it,black_comedy
have seen this movie a good few times now and i still love itplot no spoiler jim carey plays the lovable truman burbank he lives in a small pleasant town where he has his daily routines and a sucky job in an insurance company well he thinks he does in fact truman is the star of the worlds biggest reality tv show adopted at birth by the tv company he has been followed by camera his whole life and the world has watched him grow up however truman  starts to notice that all is not as it should be and this is where we join the filmthis is a witty film without the in your face comedy that carey has made his own over the last 10 years he doesnt play it up and completely succeeds at making you feel for truman as he wanders aimlessly through this big brother style prison the rest of the cast are secondary to jim as he carries the movie all by himselfthis is a great film for a lazy sunday evening when the fun for the weekend is over and monday is looming up fast curl up on the couch with someone you love and let yourself become enveloped in the film a bit of popcorn would come in handy as wellall in all this is one of the most unique films i have ever or will ever see it should be required watching for all film buffs as there are so many references to other films in therewill watch again,black_comedy
truman burbank jim carey is the main star in this film he is a normal person who thinks that everything is real but is actually being filmed by over 5000 cameras in a made up place called seahaven truman doesnt know he is being filmed but every one else does this film was very unique in a way i cant think of a better way to film it it was a very successful film in my point of view and i think that the comparison of this film to another film would be puked or the mask on punked every thing is fake except the main character but on the mask the main character is jim careyi think the message that the director wanted to get across was that if you get lied to all the time it could hurt you emotionally insideby luke bartlett,black_comedy
heh i really enjoyed this movie a lot i mean ya it is pretty riduclous that you could keep someone in a giant dome like that but hey its hollywood the movie it self was pretty funny though a conspiracy like that has got to be entertaining even still i enjoyed the subtle humor of that show when marvin tells turman hey look at that sunset its perfect he has quite a paint brush lol paint brush o the comedy though the best part is when chris talks to turman through the sky lol god speaks thats great you know though i was thinking what will happen now that turman is out that dome could do so much now that you think of it a whole private little world complete with cool weather effects,black_comedy
havent you ever wondered what it would be like to be the star of your very own truman show have you ever wondered if you in fact areimagine for a moment a documentary featuring one debbie samuels who you remember as that girl you liked in the ninth grade and once thought she liked you only here she is a disgruntled exactress named morgana windemere who complains about how the writers once told her to give you significant glances then suddenly decided to go in a different directioni thought i was going to be the costar you know the girlfriend but then they said i wasnt working even though he liked me they made me snub him in the cafeteria and then said my family moved to canada not even a farewell episode elsewhere on the show onetime childhood bullies complain about the unlovable characters they had to portray all the writers ever did with that guy was have us beat him up one complains they said it was good for the ratings the concept of is a lot of fun jim carrey plays truman burbank who gradually comes to realize he is in fact being watched by everyone in the sheltered community of shorehaven where he has spent all his life indeed there is a reason why trumans wife approvingly holds up household products in the middle of dinner conversations and why the travel agency features posters showing planes struck by lightning he is the unknowing star of his own sitcomi wish i enjoyed the movie as much though funny in parts it is more of a weteyed spectacle featuring an oftenserious jim carrey staring upward in one of those whatdoesitallmean poses that has marked too much of director peter weirs work since dead poets society aiming for maximum uplift the film sometimes forgets to keep its feet on the groundthe film is in many ways like being there the fragile but brilliant peter sellers comedy with a similarly minor key classical music score but is less sure of what it wants to be at times its a broad satire on modern life like when truman watches people walking by his house and figures out they are on a loop at other times it goes for a more realistic bent with a group of people who advocate trumans release including natascha mcelhone as lauren trumans version of my debbie samuels and a headstrong director with a god complex named christof naturally enough and played by ed harriswe know how jealously you guard your privacy a smug tv commentator harry shearer begins a rare interview with christof ironic of course given christofs treatment of trumanmore comedy could have been mined from the concept of truman but comedy is not weirs forte and except for that travel agency and a scene where truman watches his wife in surgery the film plays it straightstill truman makes you think even if it doesnt make you laugh and theres a satisfying conclusion that teases out the metaphysical concepts the movie has played with all along its manipulative yes but genuinely clever if it doesnt make you look extra hard in your bathroom mirror the next morning maybe youre just looking into the wrong camera,black_comedy
when my family and i watched the movie we expected a hysterical comedy instead we got a drama about a man whose life is a tv show and how he slowly realizes that its fake and tries to escape from the fantasy hes living in this has got to be one of jim carreys greatest performance it was a chance for him to prove that he is an actor and not just a comic and he perfects it well ed harris a good actor gives one of his greatest performances ever as christof the creator the father and the villain who obsesses with so much that he makes truman a prisoner in his worldthere are some flaws though why did christof have to obsess about truman so much what was so special about truman that made everyone watch him on the tv and what was christof trying to prove in his show that peoples private lives must be watched by others though the flaws kind of drag the movie a little it is nonetheless a masterpiece and one of jim carreys greatest and i think he should play more dramatic roles that one day will get him a oscar that he deserves9 out of 10,black_comedy
jim carrey had been a riot for me as an eight year old boy watching the mask for the first time ace ventura was also great but the routine was old and i had grown tired of it i happened to stumble across earlier this year while visiting my grandparents and it was breath takingthe mere thought of a television show made solely to keep one man imprisoned was horrible but intriguing at the same time it made me want to tear apart the producers of the show but made me watch in curiosity as we were slowly brought into the world of truman a 30something man who sells insurance and has never traveled outside of his hometown everything was created for him and him alone and everyone is trained to keep him unaware of the world outside the world around himyou feel sorry for truman want to scream shout run into the film and wake him up but you cant he is like an unborn baby unaware that this isnt realitythe cast was incredible with carrey delivering his best performance theres no talking out of his behind stupid noises or faces ed harris delivers as the tv producer who decided to play god for trumanthe final minutes of are truly beautiful masterfully filmed the music the lack of dialogue it brought tears to even my eyes as i was left in wonder at how something like this came to happen and at what was to happen next it was shocking but most of all it was beautifulthere was no gratuitous violence language or sex it was a character driven story through and through and the viewer is on trumans road to self discovery throughout the entire thingi cant stress it enough the film was for lack of any other word beautiful from beginning and especially the end,black_comedy
is truly a movie we need in todays world of massive media coverage who hasnt felt like poor truman feeling like the whole world was watching our every move imagine finding out that was actually true i have a hard time not getting teary during the scene where truman talks to his best friend and his best friend in the same sentence proclaims that truman is like a brother to him and then tells him the lie to top all lies all while swearing truman can trust him in the scene truman has tears in his eyes as he is really listening but yet you can tell he has doubts to his friends honestyat least that is what i feel at that moment everyone can relate to truman he feels that there is no one in his world he can trust and hearing his best friend lie finally verified that for him the risk he takes in the end is truly a quest for real love and real friendships and in this action there is somewhat a lesson to the viewer ed harris and jim carrey are terrifically cast even if they dont interact until the last few minutes of the movie sometimes the creator must let his creation go ,black_comedy
after truman was born he lived in a false world his actions could be watched by every audience except himself even when he was sleeping in this world only he was a real person the other people were just the supporting roles according to the producer christof they came on or quieted so trumans world was full of lies one day he found the truth he chose to leave the false world and lived his real lifechristof really was a cruel guy how dare he made up a world for truman everybody does not want to be cheated it is meaningless to live in a fabricated world for any person although sometimes the truth is ugly you have to accept itthis time jim carrey brought us not only laughs but also tears he made the role so perfect that he deserved fully to be the best actor golden globe awardan excellent thoughtprovoking movie 810,black_comedy
this movie was exactly what jim carey needed for his reputation i loved jim carey in all of his comedy movies while some people thought he was too childish and stupid this movie proves all those doubtful people wrong jim carey was superb in this movie its no wonder he won an oscar for best actor for this movie my respect for jim carey as an actor has increased so much this movie proves to me that jim carey is more than just a funny man this man can act plus the movie was so intelligent and well thought out plus the cast crew was amazing as well this movie is definitely worth your time no matter what type of movie you like trust me on movies if you watch the movies i commented and read my comments you will agree,black_comedy
for most of people they face a situation which is like this you are not satisfied with your current situation but you want to change that and you dont have the couragebut trueman did that so we believe we can probably like trueman we are all on a show and we are all on the performance stage in the every minutes do you want to take a change so take your own boat and make your own journeyi feel the film is underrated in imdb with the great imagination of the script and the outstanding performance i gave it 9 out of 10,black_comedy
this idea spooked me out a bit the whole world watching one guy on a television programme a ridiculously humongous set so that hed never know jim carey was perfect a seriously funny person but he has another brilliant personality up his sleeve he can look seriously insane jim brings a refreshingly interesting and masterful edge to this film he plays an ordinary insurance seller in a world that seems to revolve strangely around him slowly he begins to realise that things are not as they seem a strange object plummets down from the sky that appears to be a stage light it starts to rain only on the spot where he is standing his car radio suddenly has strange interferences and then starts reading out his exact coordinates jim carey plays the role very well and one of my favourite scenes is where he and his supposed wife are alone in the house and jim snaps the wifes  actors  desperate attempts to suppress his confused anger and realisation is very cleverly done but the whole idea though being original does seem a bit too farfetched jim carey as always adds his hilariously wacky touch to the film and overall this is a masterful and original film that impressed and intrigued me massively good morning and in case i dont see ya good afternoon good evening and goodnight very funny 710 ,black_comedy
jim carrey is by far the best comedy actor i have ever seen in my 14 years on this weird planet an this film which i watched just five minutes before this comment is a touching and also funny film and i will undoubtedly watch this film again and i think if you havent watched this film yet then you must be mad or insane because its a great film but i think watching it the second time round will help you get your head around this great movie so if you havent seen it what are you waiting for go and see itwell by far one of the most touching films ever made and it just makes you want to knock the living day lights out of the character that considers himself god,black_comedy
when we first meet truman burbank jim carrey he just seems like and ordinary chipper guy living an ordinary life married to the beautiful meryl laura linneyhe seems to be just finebut as he leaves for work a piece of lighting equipment falls from a clear blue sky you soon realize that trumans life is far from fineand that is the premise of directed by peter weir truman wants to leave his town of seahaven and see the world but he slowly realizes that the town doesnt want him to leave and with good reason he is the star of an incredibly popular worldwide show only he doesnt know thishis whole life from womb to man has been televised created by christof ed harris the town people including his wife and parentsare actors each one of them manipulating trumans emotions and responses christof even creates a way to keep truman from leaving his father died in a boating accident causing young truman to be afraid of waterbut as much as christof can try to control truman he fails truman becomes rebellious trying desperately to escape his existence more importantly he is in love with a girl named laurennatascha mcelhone who he met in school but was taken away she tried to tell truman the truthin one of the films most dramatic scenes truman has escaped the town by sailboat conquering his fear of the water christof playing god to the end calls upon the elements to stop him sun stormslightning trying to crush the very thing that he created when truman reaches the end of the line in the form of a sky blue wall christof speaks to him from the sky as like the voice of god trying to coax him to remainin a world in which every network has at least 1 reality television show is not as effective as when it was first released however you may say that the film may have brought home the point that we as viewers are fascinated with watching someone elses life unfold in front of our eyescarreys performance is incredible clearly showing he has dramatic range its too bad that he cant do this more often but audiences prefer him to make them laugh insteadfor the longest i had a huge beef with the way it ended in which truman walks through the door and out of the show forever i had wished they could have shown us what would happen after he left however i finally understood why they did not truman had been trapped by fear the fear of water for example when christof talks to truman trying to convince him to stay he tells truman that the world he is about to enter is different from the world he is leaving the real world is full of lies deceit and horrors trumans world is a place where none of those fears exist when truman steps through the door going into the real world you realize that truman has truly conquered his fears after all he steps into this brave new world unafraid of what will happen to him still it would have been nice for us to see him reunite with laurensylvia but deep down you know that they will great film to watch,black_comedy
i happened along when it played on television thinking it would simply be another jim carrey vehicle im not much of a fan of his outrageously overthetop style of comedy i passed it by when i came across it again flipping channels i stopped to watch for a bit needless to say it only took a few minutes until i was completely engrossed in the story and angry that i had missed the first half of it surprisingly enough while channel surfing later that same night the same movie was playing yet a second time on the same channel right after it had finished the first time what struck me as extraordinary about this chain of events was that it was disturbingly similar to the strange coincidences experienced by the title character of the film truman burbank has lived his life believing himself to be no different than everyone else around him but after a few strange events happen and an ever strengthening feeling that the world seems to stop when he isnt around truman begins to notice signs that all is not right around him unbeknownst to him truman burbank is the most famous man in the world but sadly enough it isnt the world he lives in all his life truman has grown up in a completely simulated environment a gigantic set truman has lived for 30 years on television 24 hours a day i have to admit  the concept was unique and the execution was excellent  as we slowly discover trumans situation we develop a bad taste in our mouths at the sheer lack of humility it would take for a human being raised for the sole purpose of providing fodder for a television show we sympathize and pity the innocent truman as he makes up feverish solutions for his feeling of being followed including that his dead father is actually alive and looking for him this goes far beyond any cloning moral dilemmas  this is a truly sick concept director peter weir who is emerging as one of hollywoods most talented directors plays the disgust element regarding trumans situation strongly he also provides an interesting portrait of the media and television industries part satire and part thoughtful reflection yet its hard to believe the thoughtful reflection side when all audiences watching trumans show seem to be characters straight out of a satire  ditzy restaurant waitresses a cackling man watching from his bathtub we cant take these characters seriously enough to reflect on what they represent in our society nevertheless weir maintains a firm directorial hand throughout his pacing is superb and his choices of music are as usual unexpected refreshingly different droning didgeridoo in the background reminiscent of dead poets society and completely succeed in beautifully complementing the film weir is no stranger to casting comedic actors in dramatic films he evoked a similar performance out of robin williams in dead poets society here he manages to morph jim carrey from playing the role of truman as a straight out comedic role into playing a real person who has the occasional comic moment besides being refreshingly subdued carrey also turns out a brilliant and consistently watchable performance which is lucky since his character in the film parallels his characters role on the tv show the entire picture revolves around truman and carrey carries no pun intended the film with ease it comes as a let down then when carrey lets himself drift ever so slightly over the top at parts when truman starts to go hysterical believing people are following him in these parts we start to see jim carrey and not the masterful facade of truman burbank he has createdthe supporting cast is less developed also paralleling trumans tv show where characters seem to simply float in and out never really connecting with the lead the character of trumans wife played by laura linney is hastily and sloppily written out of the story leaving more room for a developing romantic subplot which mercifully is only taken to a certain level between truman and a former cast member natascha mcelhone whom truman believes is the only woman he ever loved and who in turn has developed feelings for truman but mcelhone has one of the flimsiest characterizations in the film despite how pivotal her character is only really getting the chance to stare anxiously and complain about how this treatment of truman is wrong its nice to see cameos from harry shearer as yet another news anchor and paul giamatti as a show technician but most of the acting support comes from ed harris masterful performance as christof the man who orchestrated and directed virtually every aspect of trumans artificial life harris is spellbinding overshadowing every actor present except carrey himself as the character stubbornly refuses to come to terms with the moral issues of his hit tv showdont be mistaken into thinking is a typical mainstream jim carrey comedy vehicle if you go in expecting this you are likely to be disappointed however if you go in anticipating a thoughtprovoking masterfully executed film which raises significant moral questions and causes us to strongly reexamine our tv addicted society you may find that is about as good as you could hope for if it wasnt for the flimsiness of the supporting characters the occasional plot hole and carrey very occasionally drifting into his ott comedy persona could easily be the best film of the year as it is well to say the least it definitely deserves a viewing and dont be put off by dislike of jim carrey  if you didnt like him before you will now910,black_comedy
is probably one of the most underrated movies ever it was a success at the time and it got some oscar nominations but somehow it didnt get the recognition it deserves when i say to friends the sentence in the title of this comment i usually get a reaction between laughter and astonishment it is much easier to pick scorcesas movies and to prefer denero over jim carrie that absurd comedianwhy is this movie so underrated one reason may be the identity of the hero and the disbelief that the star of ice ventura can be part of a masterpiece another reason may be that people find it hard to believe that a film can be both entertaining and funny and light in character and yet deep and sophisticated and maybe the reason is the prejudice against what is holiwoodic whatever the reasons are they are wrong truman is a movie that should be watched again and again and to those who will do it a very enjoyable experience is promisedto make things short i will skip the obvious details such as acting directing etc and move to the most important stuff and that is what was the movie trying to say there are three levels of meaning in the movie the first is a satire of the current media predicting the current trend of reality tv this level is obvious enough not to discussed thoroughlythe second level is a subject dealt with quite a lot in our era the tension between high and low art or between art and kitsch while truman is a film beautifully designed is not only a bizarre tv show but also an extremely lowstandard show anything around trumans life is a kitsch and this is a paradox which is in the basis of the movie in addition the movie brilliantly moves between the inside and outside between the atmosphere of the movie and of the tv series philip glass music has an extremely important part in that making this movie an outstanding example for the importance of film musicthe third level is in my opinion the most interesting and that is the religious one the creatorcreated relations between truman and the director which holds the name chrostoph are clearly of religious context but it takes several views of the movie to see that these relations are really what the movie talks about and are apparent in almost every scene many questions arise from that topic and they are dealt with brilliantly with the climax of the last minutes one does not expect a light hollywood comedy to be a deep theological essay but that is exactly what is go and see for yourselves,black_comedy
is an original and brilliant idea it is a satire for how the media consumes us truman is a metaphor for the public he is born into a false reality of life which is controlled by a corporation christof this relates to us because most of us grow up glued to the television and hanging onto every word the media tells us most people dont realize the power of the media it can run your entire life as it did trumans the media shapes who we are in real life we are shaped by about 5 or 6 major corporations which own everything around us in trumans case he is controlled by one corporation christof will go to any extreme to give the fans what they want at the end of the movie he makes the whether so stormy that he almost kills his movie star for the sake of ratings this is only a slight exaggeration of the extremes that the real corporations will go to for higher ratings the real corporations tell you everything wrong with you and they tell you the exact way you have to be in order to be acceptable to society just so you will buy their products or watch their tv shows all of these ideas about the media are expressed in their are so many subtle but important details about the media that are overlooked so you pay close attention and watch it over and over if you need to,black_comedy
the first time i watched when it came out in 1998 i was impressed with the story a delightful science fiction tale and with the acting the movie proving that jim carrey could do more on the big screen than talk through his butt when i revisited this film 5 or 6 years later i was even more impressed for one thing this story has proved very prophetic how many reality shows dominate the tv today it also has many allegorical layers that i missed the first time i think 5 years ago i had a sense of some attempt at symbolism in the ed harris character is christos hes the creator and hes up above over seeing everything however the more i watch it i see truman burbank as a christ figure also a man singled out sacrificing his life for the sake of others a man who knows he does not belong in this world a man who ascends to his true home at the end of the story in fine resurrection style theres even a scene where he appears to be walking on water again its an entertaining story on the surface level but like truman himself i hope the viewers can rise above the surface and see a new world,black_comedy
sits on a genre crossroads with comedy drama romance and thriller all coming together to form one of the greatest films of the 1990sthe island of seahaven is not far off being the perfect place to live it is inhabited by the friendliest people of the united states and with scarce litter and impeccable weather it is almost too good to be true for all his life truman burbank jim carrey thought that his lifestyle was no different to any other americans with his perfect wife delightful neighbours and loyal friend marlon noah emmerich who pops round with a fourpack of beer every now and then it is when suspicions mount in trumans mind as to why members of the public ignore him if he runs in front of a moving car or dont so much as turn a head if he curses in the middle of the street that the plot line begins to unfoldas he strings together proof of his suspicions truman begins to plan his exit of the conspiracy that he feels is going on around him at this point we meet the all powerful kristof ed harris who is the directorproducercreator of the hit television program after meeting kristof the audience realises that truman is permanently being surrounded by a hive of actors and actresses who improvise their everyday lives to create this haunting illusion of reality so that kristof can continue to run the worlds most popular television programmekristof doesnt just want to make money from he wants to mould the perfect man by acting as the puppeteer above trumans life kristof adopted truman as a baby and from that day forward has put every emotion thought and experience into trumans head i think that kristofs character wants to create a world that contradicts the real world of poverty crime and waronly concentrates on the last few days of trumans life in seahaven but with the use of flashbacks the scriptwriters manage to give the audience a wide perspective of what has happened in previous episodes of the show  which were somewhat faulted by 36 year old carrey attempting to play an 18 year old boy a feat that not many actors can achieve without the help of plastic surgery needless to say these flashbacks inform us on the first girl that truman ever loved sylvia a rebellious actress who met truman as a teenager and attempted to tell him the truth before being thrown off the set by protective producer kristofdirector peter weir creates the idea of reality television by filming most of the movie with hidden cameras so wherever he goes the fact that we are seeing truman through a keyhole or a car radio adds to the theme of the movie i didnt tire of this but at some points i couldnt help but wonder how there was a hidden camera filming truman from underwater but its hard to enjoy such a momentous film if you pick out mere technicalities like thatthe plot is tightly evolved around the idea of truman feeling trapped and he attempts to escape this incredulous lifestyle of perfection on several occasionsthese actions conveniently allow kristof to display his power by trying to psychologically and physically stop truman from leaving the island using subliminal hints on the radio and graphically showing aeroplanes being struck by lightning on posters these unsubtle methods were one of the funnier moments of blatant censorship in the film but when they fail to change trumans mind and he sets sail to leave the island kristof directs an electrical storm to strike his boat this great film has got the nail biting climax that it needed to make it memorable in the film industry for years to come as the film to create the craze of reality tvwould almost definitely make my list for the top twenty films of all time it gave jim carrey the boost in his career that took him away from his less sophisticated roles such as ace venture pet detective the mask and dumb and dumber this serious roll as truman burbank proved that jim carrey has got more than one genre of acting style and since then he has continued to show his true potential as an actor in recent hits eternal sunshine of the spotless mind the majestic and me myself and irene one thing that i hold against this film is that it began the reality tv plague that britain has been infected with for the past six years programs like big brother im a celebrity get me out of here and pop idol have leached off the prospect that andrew niccol thought of when writing the script filming the everyday lives of people for the publics entertainment the fact is i can no longer turn on my television without seeing a disgusting northern family get filmed swapping wives with an ideal posh family or watch a celebrity eat a cows testicle and then puke it up shortly afterwards and i therefore put the entire blame on george orwell and andrew niccol writer ofi first saw this film when i was 8 and thoroughly enjoyed it the sunny setting and funny scenes of truman in front of his bathroom mirror are ideal for pleasing the younger audience the concept of truman being watched wherever he goes is probably more haunting for adults than children so therefore i would say that it is suitable for almost anybody probably not a film for the claustrophobic thoughthe turning point of jim carreys acting career and a film that caters for any mood 910,black_comedy
truman is an authentic man in a false worldtruman burbank insurance broker thinks hes living a normal life however his life is technically fake falsely created and showcased on international tv his wife meryl and acquaintances marlon are all actors and its all for himself youre watching a first hand experience of extreme reality tv on air and unawarejim carrey the cable guy ace ventura acts in an extraordinary straight role as the unsuspecting truman and surprisingly gives us a commonsensical and elegant performance the bigoted view of carrey is not a respected view but hosts the verification that carrey in actual fact can act without throwing himself around the set i couldnt possibly see another actor playing truman by any means jim carrey has the enthusiasm of a child and something which on no account lets you disregard him corresponding trumaned harris amazing feat as christof completes the movies stratagem harris has an imperative role as the originator of trumans world and the administrator of the show christof who theoretically plays god directs and creates story lines as this god figure he guides truman through a false life introducing fresh citizens and unscrambling predicaments as a quantity of plots go wrong christofs control room is an impressive element of the movie as you see hundreds of monitors concerning various cameras a large screen overlooking the entire room and even computers which manage the habitats weather and have power over daylightthe motion pictures plot is an appreciatively clear plot the viewer watches similar to if it is a normal channel on television concealed cameras first lead you throughout trumans regular day as an insurance broker stumbling across people he recognizes and being involved in subtle product placements yet another day he meets his father who truman believed drowned after boating in a storm this was a clever way to make truman petrified of water so he can not escape from seahaven unexpectedly trumans father is taken away by unsystematic people and truman is left bewildered feelings of a previous loveatfirstsite who broke in to the seahaven studio confound him more believing she was taken to fiji truman in conclusion decides he will getaway from seahaven and escape oblivious that hes in a film studiothe production begins with introducing the appealing concept of actors instead of opening by introducing the authentic actors names they are specified two names in the motion picture for instance meryl trumans wife in the show is named hannah gill in the real world this tells us that merely truman whos name by opportunity can be pronounced as trueman is authentic in seahaven as well as these a succinct interview with the shows foremost actors explainsis based on reality tv and has an analogous perception to big brother seahaven trumans home town fashioned for truman by christof has approximately 5000 cameras several as minuscule as a pin head the cameras are located where truman can be seen perpetually cameras are even in the most incongruous places like trumans office pencil sharpener in addition to a dog collar george orwells 1984 can strongly be compared to with the concept of someone being watched all the time and being trapped in one place in trumans case stuck in seahaven the issue of voyeurism can also be concerned within and if a program of such correspondence should actually be aired devoid of trumans authorization is a tremendous film for the whole family and can be enjoyed even after the 103 minutes issues concerning such a product being created in our lives can be safely debated with your family a second watch is also recommended as many new features are unlocked after the end is revealed,black_comedy
this is your only spoiler warningpros  interesting structure the creator figure places his personal world inside the one he has created  weir waits until the end to get heavyhanded saving us the boredom  weir deemphasizes the mysticalmythicalmagical in favor of the old man vs system cliche character exists in a world of cameras  interesting parallel between literal and unreal camerascons  obvious vangelis wannabe music  real person lives in false environment except everyone around him is in on the gag hence real while he is manufactured by the environment hence fake  the film is about the person on camera not the camera itselffinal analysis   midrange material,black_comedy
the best part about this movie is the connected unrevealing of the small facts that bother truman burbank and the meaning of which he just cannot percept initially the movie has great pace and does not waste time to explain how trumans life was captured on tv but straightly starts from how truman gathers the facts which lightly unreveal about something that has constantly haunted him his whole life has been captured on tvexcellent direction in a manner in which you believe that you are watching a reality show more than a movie great performances by jim carey and ed harris the movie has the most symbolic and sarcastic ending i have ever witnessed obviously a genuine masterpiece without the usage of sex violence or offensive language shows that a superb plot supported by artistic direction and intense acting can always be a plus for a moviei would certainly rate this movie 90100 this movie is a mustsee,black_comedy
the film reminded me of the tv serial the prisoner which starred patrick mcgoohan many years ago the subject matter is very topical as the media strives to create more and more realism with fly on the wall documentaries i do not feel the premise of a person living in his own tv show so extraordinary nowadaysperhaps we should see this film as a warning about where the media may be taking usthe acting is excellent throughout and the revelations as they come certainly kept me glued to the screen throughout i thoroughly recommend this film,black_comedy
it took me 45 minutes to realize i was watching a clever twist on prisoner the 1967 tvseries the only thing that kept me watching after that was my curiosity i had been observing jim carreys career then this movie showed a very different jim carrey than i was used to i hope he continues down this path widening his character spectrum i have never watched all of the prisoner so i cannot say both stories ended the same way or differently,black_comedy
i loved the concept of the movie  the idea of a reality show based on one mans life and following each and every of his moves was brilliant especially when you consider how millions of viewers are attracted to todays reality programs such as survivor  i believe this movie alone may have paved the way for some of todays shows and were inspired by reallife shows that preceded the film most notably mtvs the real world when its done properly you get a movie which centers around a man who begins to question what is real in life and whats not as the world that he is raised in begins to unravel  two major problems however plagued what could have been an instant classicthe first is the lifeless reactions of the viewers  to me the film portrays the viewers mostly as people who sacrifice their own lives to watch someone elses  now i know this is true in the lives of millions but even for a phenomenon like a show will also have millions of critics although not as many as there are supporters  correct me if im wrong but from what i saw there was only one standout skeptic who understood the whole thing and there were many more who shared the same views but were not seen or heard at allthe second and the most unforgivable error was the ending which i felt was an anticlimatic conclusion to a movie that built up a great deal of drama before it  the ending was terribly written and did not have much depth or thought into it and its closure was much more predictable than it shouldve been  im not asking for much  i just wanted a final conflict featuring the best and worst of both sides which i felt didnt happenall in all a 7 rating in my opinion may be a bit sympathetic but i felt they did everything else so well only that it deserved better  it featured jim carrey expanding his talent and playing his role almost to a tee backed by a strong supporting cast and featured a good plot outline and great scenery  i would still recommend this film to anyone but i would keep in mind the two significant flaws that kept this movie from joining the ranks of the elite,black_comedy
is a media satire exploiting the fact that we watch too much tv and get too involved in the soap characters of our favourite programs as well as bringing this message across the director of this truly fantastic film peter weir of witness fame also manages suck the viewer in to truman burbanks world in superb fashion jim carrey and ed harris shine as the star of the tv show and the creator of the show respectively both worthy of best actor and best supporting actor oscars without a doubt the sheer originality of the film makes it stand out from the rest as one of the greatest films ever made we find ourselves drawn towards truman and his life and are all the time longing for the eventual climax of the film to occur this climatic part of the film is surprisingly moving and makes you realise what a truly great film you are watching its one you will not stop talking about afterwards with the people you saw it with  the sign of a great film no one has an excuse of not seeing it  it makes you think question yourselves and your surroundings and marvel at its concept,black_comedy
very polite very very pretentious the religious overtones way too obvious christof a voice in the sky and successful because there was nothing better to fill its niche copyright suit notwithstanding  the whole point of satire is to have a little bite like american beauty natural born killers even cable guy just to name a few  tts had no bite at all more of a light gumming on the medias wrist which is something the media actually likes sort of a friars club roast situation  the media candidly acknowledges the low level of quality in their product and makes very lame attempts to cover it up   the real worlders and the people who watch them know the show is cut chopped and edited into something very far removed from what they experienced  and the argument that we as a society watch too much tv has been around from the day tv was massproduced  doesnt make the media shake it makes them nod their heads like yep were that bad  and if we had the resources at our disposal wed do something like if we gave them enough reason to tune in  that said really isnt satire at all just a copy of a copy with an expensive set to mitigate this fact,black_comedy
is one of those films that is good not great but will likely mean a lot more to the cinema in the future  the film deals with a man jim carrey who has literally had his entire life scripted and filmed for a 24hour a day sevenday a week and 365days a year television station  the creator ed harris in an oscarnominated role controls everything in trumans life and is a type of god figure  carrey slowly starts to realize that his nearperfect life is not at all what it seems and becomes bent on freeing himself from a personal prison which he has been in his entire life  the screenplay and direction are insightful and overall excellent  carrey and harris both give top flight performances and the overall creativity is secondtonone  much like network will likely become more important with age  45 out of 5 stars,black_comedy
what would you do if you found out your wife was not your wife your mother not your mother your friends not your friends and your dead father neither your father nor dead this film was packed full of opportunities to explore the human and emotional issues behind these questions in a powerful and thoughtprovoking way but aside from a couple of scenes failed to do sojim carrey stars as truman burbank whose entire life since before he was born has been the subject of a television show his world unknown to him is a huge studio replete with oceans artificial weather etc everyone with whom he interacts is an actor hired to play a part carrey shows the ability to transcend the usual comedic roles he plays and displays dramatic talent but either he or the writers producers etc seem to feel the need to keep falling back on his comedic talent facial expressions etc rather than allowing the drama of his journey of selfdiscovery to build a glimpse of what might have been possible with this movie occurred in the scene where one almost thought he was about to kill the actress playing his wife as he crumbles psychologically with what he recognizes to be the inconsistencies of his life but there are too few of these powerful momentsthis was a good movie but could have been so much better,black_comedy
this is by far jim carreys finest and one of the finest movies ever realeased  its funny serious actionpacked and romantic all in the same boat  even though a couple of my friends said it was terrrible i think anyone who wants to see a movie and think too should see truman and his wonderful show  ,black_comedy
an onfilm miracle is the only words to describe this masterpiece of a movie peter weirs dark insight into the world of television is more powerful than those classic films network and broadcast news in that it uses an imaginary but starkly realistic story to show how people bring what they see on tv into their lives overcoming their own personal lives jim carrey does his best and succeeds in a great but non oscarworthy performance but ed harris is the real star here his role which contains only several minutes of screentime represents the evil face of the media his powerful performance really deserves at least an oscar nomination along with the overly underrated peter weir who has made four of the most original films of alltime now,black_comedy
i do wish that commentators would stop promoting this film as a deep and meaningful take on a voyeuristic society certainly the plot line concept is a reversal of the sad us shockchat shows with a twist of scifiin this case the prisoner truman is unwittingly exposing his sanitised private life on 24 hour tv and is happily trapped in a safe world until he actually finds out that he is trappedbut thats it really  the film is then plotted as a comic realisation of this concept with no further depth at all it dips deeply into the american sugary sentiment pool  and is a vehicle tailored for jim carrey  an opportunity that he does not waste to be less goofydont worry however everything is handed to you on a plate in an explanatory section in the middle of the film just in case you are a little confused its as sinister as a choc chip cookieso  entertaining enjoyable well produced  but leave it there it will run and run on us cable for years to come,black_comedy
one way to look at is as a satire on modern television another way to look at it and the one i prefer is as the story of the only modern day man to ever go up against god  that is something we all would like to do at one time or another in our life to just go up against the omnipotent force in our lives and ask questions make demands defy them etc  when truman is facing both his fear of water and the power that controls his life at the same time it was one of the only two times a movie has made me cry the other being the ending to cuckoos nest  nobody else can say that they have first stared down the being that guides their universe let alone say that they have triumphed over them  how many people have even shown a tenth of the courage truman showed then,black_comedy
see how filmmakers think of the universe a door and a small exitsignthats it nothing more behind are some sceneworkers smoking no place to go for the star unless you dont know you are the star truman what is true finds out that this is not the world for himbut when he realizes the moment christof speaks to him like a god for truman he is god episodes 10909  10112 of are the essence of what we like to call struggle for independence warhol said everybody will get his 15 minutes of fame everybody seems to long for that after truman left the show how long will it take until he wants to be famous again maybe he is talkshown as the man exploited for television then medias lead theirselvses ad absurdum1010,black_comedy
finally got to see this much hyped and talked about film i must say wheres the beef this film was a bore the acting by jim carey was fair at best he should stick to comedy ed harris i have seen better i can see why this was not nominatedthere is nothing to this film that grabs a hold of you,black_comedy
while its certainly refreshing to see a movie with jim carrey in it that doesnt involve rectal rhetoric and other childish antics i was disappointed that failed to live up to the extreme ballyhoo that preceded it certainly it would be difficult for any movie to shine under those circumstances but a better effort wouldve been nice a simplistic plot that couldve been explored fully in a twilight zone episode and i think probably was intentionally bad acting by burbanks supporting cast was offputting as was the logical inconsistency of the basic premise that the dreary details of an excruciatingly boring life could be the source of endless fascination for millions of viewers certainly enough to make your average jerry springer devotee ponder but for the rest of us come on,black_comedy
this film deserves all the oscars  it deserves best picture best actor jim carrey best supp actor ed harris best director best original screenplay best art direction best cinematography and best dramatic score  unfortanetly saving private ryan will win everything  had a better message  saving private ryans message  war is not good gee really  you think  was attempting to tell us about a problem that is happening now  a problem that has not yet been fully approached  everyone has done a damn war movie many of which have been better than spielbergs  many were even scarier than saving private ryan go rent das boot  even tom hanks will edge out jim carrey  tom hanks who won five oscars at once playing a gay retarded man  the academy has already annoyed the blacks the homosexuals and the women  if they annoy jim carrey fans then they really have lost their audience  im not even going to watch if they dont nominate for the major awards,black_comedy
after watching the ace venture moviesliar liar and rubber face i never thought jim carrey could pull off a dramatic role but he did and with great talent if you are wondering why so many people loved this film it was most likely its symbolism,black_comedy
when was originally relased i was eagerly awaiting the chance to see itim glad i missed it i went into my recent rental viewing with the same attitude i go into all movies that generate a lot of hype this suckswell i was rightother than jim carreys truman all of the other characters were wooden and poorly acted  laura linneys merel was the worst offender as was the marlon the best friend i dont remember the actors namenot will i even attempt to find it as it would be a waste of timethe ending was possibly the worst ive seen to date leaving you with a thats it feeling in the pit of your stomachif you havent seen it yet let me save you the trouble he gets out of the show by walking through a doori wasted 375 on a rental and an hour and 45 minutes on this i know many of you will disagree with me but this is simple factshould be cancelled,black_comedy
this is my most hated movie it is the most offensive movie i have ever watched and it is not only the movie itself that i find offensive it is also the huge positive popular reaction to it you should all be ashamed of yourselves and perhaps reevaluate yourselves to see if you actually have any values let me get this straight a human being human life still matters to some is trapped at birth illegally detained which is the legal equivalent of kidnapping in an immense domelike structure and introduced to a cast of characters who play the part of his family friends etc none of it is real and it is all broadcast on tv which is hugelypopulari am trying not to become angry as i write this this movie reveals a hidden danger in the human subconscious and all of you who approve of it are latent misanthropic psychopathslet me ask you a rhetorical question how far will you go for entertainment will you trap a small child in the cage of your fancy and decoration tell me which country would allow this which country with a shred of decency left i am not talking about the governments i am talking about the people im talking about you if you would do this to a human being or even admire its depiction in art and i knew you i would keep a very close eye on you you people disgust me,black_comedy
jim carrey plays truman burbank a man whos life has been watched by the public ever since he was born his wife and friends are all actors his home is a studio cameras follow him around everywhere all that and more so everyone can watch his show the only thing is truman thinks hes an ordinary guy and he doesnt know anything about this until one day he finds out the truth about his socalled lifei really wanted to like but i just didnt i mean yeah the idea for the movie is good and even though im not really a jim carrey fan i guess he gives quite a believable performance here lets just say edtv another movie about a man being watched is much better than this,black_comedy
the tragedy that people consider this film reaches some philosophical nirvana accompanied with a deep meaningful message adds to the contempt i already have for this excrement a childs mind could only deliver an idea like this maybe plagiarising a twilight zone episode the technically superior camera work and uncluttered cartoon like sets only allow the viewer sharp focus on the banality of this story i will not go into detail as others have i just add my 110 to the mixsome of us are not fans of jim carey either and his addition to any movie relegates it to doom anyhow i knew it would be a bad idea to watch this but i went along accompanied by a nagging suspicion with the high score and praisemore proof that either the majority are stupid or i am a loony we did go to the moon,black_comedy
nice idea bad delivery could be many things chock full of symbols is it the journey of the homosexual male trying to be like everyone else at his own expense is it about conformity is it about the weight of heterosexual mores and traditions that kill you in the end about lost dreams lost loves lost selves about naivete and trust about lies about living lies marrying who we hate and doing what we dislike to please others about ancestry adoption trumans real father isnt real making up god in a godless society dreams of perfection parable about hollywood and what they try to shove down the publics throat while brainwashing them with ads making people buy things latent lesbianism all the women dislike men fake selves we present to the world masturbation both mental and physical the emptiness that comes with getting what you think you want american actors are too self awaretheir egos always intrude god is a repressed gay man throughout jim carrey fails at drama you pick the scenario you like,black_comedy
focuses on the life of truman burbank jim carrey who is an ordinary guy working as a loss adjustor however he is unaware that his whole life has been turned into a tv show in which every move he makes and everything he says is being observed by millions of people around the world following a chance encounter truman begins to realise that everything isnt as it seems and that maybe his life isnt quite as ordinary as he first thoughtim a big fan of jim carrey but for some reason this is one film that ive overlooked since its release in 1998 the concept of the film is interesting and i have a feeling that this film will age rather well at the moment we are in the grip of several reality shows and in parts clearly satirises the reality show genres the camera cuts from time to time to show various groups of people utterly engrossed in what they are watching  this element is believable as i honestly do believe that there are people who cant do without their fix of made in chelsea or the only way is essex uk reality showsor keeping up with the kardashians as an american equivalent demonstrates this in a humorous but subtle mannerfor me just seemed to get everything right the script was intelligent but it was also cohesive the plot was straight forward but it also managed to be touching and moving truman burbank was such a likable person that its impossible not to care for his character about halfway through the film there is a 5 minute segment which explains how came about and once you know the truth about truman youll care for both him and his cause all the morejim carrey proves here that he is a much more talented actor than some give him credit for his zany ott comedic acting style that weve seen in films such as the mask liar liar and the ace ventura films are certainly not to everyones taste but i happen to like this style of acting and think hes a very funny man carrey gives a much more restrained performance here and his performance perfectly suits the tone of this film carreys strong performance and tight script combine together to make this a pretty much flawless film the cinematography and directing were also top notch ed harris was also superb as the creatordirector but hes only given limited screen timethe ending of the film was suitably uplifting and i can honestly say that this is one of the few films ive seen where i didnt want it to end is a wonderful film which combines humour satire intelligence a good script and also manages to be touching and uplifting its a rare example of a film which not only felt too short but also left me with a big smile on my face is a film that simply has to be seen,black_comedy
i dont know why they didnt give him oscar its very good idea that you can reflect it in your own life and the soundtracks are amazing i dont know why they didnt give him oscar its very good idea that you can reflect it in your own life and the soundtracks are amazing i dont know why they didnt give him oscar its very good idea that you can reflect it in your own life and the soundtracks are amazing i dont know why they didnt give him oscar its very good idea that you can reflect it in your own life and the soundtracks are amazing ,black_comedy
one of my top5 movies of all time jim carrey delivers a flawless performance as truman burbank a madefortelevision character unknowingly viewed by millions 247 around the world trumans world the lovely 1950sish town of seahaven is the creation of cristof played wonderfully by ed harris all the townsfolk including his wife meryl laura linney best friend marlon noah emmerich and even his mother holland taylor are in on charade all goes well till truman starts discovering how the town is staged wanting to see the world including one true love lauren natascha mcelhone truman desperately attempts to leave the island and discover whats beyond seahaveni didnt see this movie when it was in theaters jim carrey in a serious film no thanks did rent it years later and couldnt believe how great this movie is the story cast music etc everything perfect this movie must be viewed more than once took me 34 times to truly appreciate the depth the film has to offer its an absolute shame this film didnt receive more oscar nominationscarrys performance is genius even subtle things like when he repeatedly taps the light that fell from the sky exactly what a child would do to first test a foreign object i liked carrey a lot in his previous comedy movies with this performance though he really shows range ed harris is perfect as christof the creator the film really slams its own industry but how do you intend to explain his 22year absence amnesia brilliant this is one of those movies you get really get lost in not concerning oneself with believability issues i also loved the way it ended with so many issues left to the viewers imagination instead of normal feelgoody hollywood ending it really is thought provokingalso the music is absolutely perfect throughout,black_comedy
is one of those movies that succeeds in many areas where most movies fail horribly one it makes a a very ambitious story seem very real and thats mostly due to the fine acting carrey and harris giving the best performances of their careers two peter weir and his fantastic direction ables to give this film an uneasy feeling which is why it is probably really hard to give this movie a genre the movie succeeds on giving the right amount of comedy drama eeriness and romance and doesnt seem to over due anything the comedy mostly stays between carrey and linney who give great chemistry and seem liked the really hated each other the drama is not in your face but it is extremely effective as some of the scenes in this movie are the most moving scenes i have ever seen on film the scene when truman meets his dad and everyone is watching and the last 5 mins get me every time the eeriness mostly stays with its twilight zone plot and this uneasy feeling of how much the media can do ecspicially now in these times when reality tv rains supreme the romance might drag the story a little but it still is a good part of the story it still gives the classic notion that you can meet someone only for 5 mins and want to spend the rest of your life with them all in all truman is good to watch i still watch it every time its on tv and it still effects me in way that few movies have,black_comedy
jim carrey can more commonly be found portraying the eccentric characters in filmsfrom the grinch to ace ventura placed as truman burbank however carrey is given a more poignant role to which he does more than justice through his immaculate characterisation this film makes the audience feel as though he is also watching what perhaps makes the film so interesting and deep is the moving relationships that truman experiences something that carrey brings across greatlymost of the film made me thinking about the possibility and actuality that is posed by the director indeed it seems that there is much philosophical debate about matters such as those addressed in the film giving a graphic representation of what a human being experiences throughout his life trumans realisation and wanting to break free also seems to be a reflection of typical personal experience when we run into troublehowever truman alone has this poweroverall a stunning film that presents deep issues and a valuable message with fantastic performancesa top film,black_comedy
in this movie jim carrey is truman a man whose life is a fake one the place he lives is in fact a big studio with hidden cameras everywhere and all his friends and people around him are actors who play their roles in the most popular tvseries in the world truman thinks that he is an ordinary man with an ordinary life and has no idea about how he is exploited until one day he finds out everything will he reacthmmmlet me see where to start with this movie it was weird but wasnt that weird compared to other movies and it was disappointing i expected more from this kind of plot the plot was excellent but the execution wasnt all that great nor interesting to catch my attentioni was actually quite bored within the first twenty five minutes until the plot started moving yeah it started getting interesting but still wasnt interesting enough it felt way too long for some reason and slightly boring i really tried to like this movie i really wanted to but it didnt work for methe performance by jim carrey was good and sometimes funny giving us a comedic relief laura linneys performance was weird and noah emmerichs decent the cinematography was fresh and original since its like big brother all over again there are some surprising plot elements which caught my attentionthis was a good movie with a good score but i expected a little more of an oomph some people might not need it and some people might do but either way it isnt bad if you want to see carrey in a serious role heres the time,black_comedy
this film was about a character called truman burbank jim carreywho is in his own world which is a television show all of his friends and family are just actors in the show and he is oblivious to thisi didnt like this film because it was not my kind of movie i felt like there wasnt enough action for my likingjim carrey was funny he kept me engaged this was the best thing about this movie although i liked his performance less than i did in bruce almighty i thought he was not as funny was not as exiting as bruce almighty there was not as much actionto make this film better they could have added a bit more action a few fights would have given it a bit more colour and it would have been better if it was a bit less fake,black_comedy
an amazing premise that constantly kept me on the edge of my seat not in a suspense thriller way was perfect to make the first dramatic jim carrey movie i ever saw one of the best movies of all time and proved more enjoyable than many if not all of his comedies have an open mind while watching this while the film is easily a drama it is actually quite funny watch it expecting a comedy and youll hate it watch it expecting a thought provoking drama and youll find it to be just that and youll often laugh out loudeveryone is familiar with the story somehow truman jim carrey is an ordinary man living in a town seahaven island that defines the term too perfect to be true and he has never left it what he doesnt realize is that the town is actually built inside a giant tv studio and over 5000 cameras are placed within the town broadcasting trumans entire life as an iconic wildly popular tv show that plays 247 and is controlled by a producer known as christof ed harris truman has never known that he is the most famous man alive as every telltale sign that might reveal it is cleverly covered up by the controllers and every one of trumans friends and family are just actors who probably have no true compassion for truman the movie follows the show up until trumans eventual discovery of his situation and his attempts to escapeone fun thing to do after you watch this film is to watch ace ventura pet detective this is a great way to see just how talented jim carrey is he was robbed at the oscars this year as his performance was dead on while he plays it straight there is the occasional glimpse of his style of comedy especially in a rather intense scene where he gives his wife several hints that he knows about his fake world his behavior in that scene will provide some relief for people who were expecting a jim carrey laughfest one thing that makes his performance in the movie better than the rest is that jim carrey is the only one playing a real person every line said by anyone else around him besides the controllers is staged everyone besides jim are playing actors that isnt saying that everyone else is bad everyone else is terrific trumans wife laura linney is the second best performance she is a brilliant actress playing a suspiciously bad actress you have to see it to believe itin spite of all the drama the movie is actually subtly hilarious sight gags all related to the plot are frequently visible as is the behavior of everyone around truman when they get suspicious that he knows his world is fake trumans wife constantly describes household products to truman as if she were a rejected audition for a badly written commercial truman doesnt seem to notice this yet travel agencies are filled with posters warning people of the deadly hazards of flying on an airplane the fact that these type of sight gags are rarely acknowledged is one source of humor also the thought of whats going through the actors heads as truman approaches them with travel plans are rather funny the best sequence of the movie is a talk show interview with christof which gives us a behind the scenes look at the show and answers many of the biggest questions we may have about the technical details of trumans lifethe combination of humor with the drama of the amazing story ultimately leaves the viewer with a lifted spirit and looking at the world a whole new way i recommend this thought provoking moving entertaining and arguably hilarious film to everybody and give it a 1010it is rated pg for thematic elements and mild language sex 110 violence 410 swearing 310 drugs 110,black_comedy
has an intriguing premise  a reality tv show whose star is oblivious of the proceedings believing it to be real lifejim carrey turns in a strong performance as a man who ultimately realises that his whole life has been a sham his growing awareness that all is not well is effectively essayed and a long way from his previous ott comic rolesthere are effective moments  the jarring product placements for the benefit of viewers the reappearance of the father that truman believed drowned as a child  but once the premise is established it all becomes rather predictable and the satire rapidly tails offfor a much more effective and more prescient satire on tv id recommend the year of the sex olympics ignoring its low budget and certain dated aspects of its production it is far more thoughtprovokingin the final analysis would have worked better as an episode of the twilight zone and without the needless chase and escape scene at the end,black_comedy
this movie was not awful but pretty close and definitely not top 250 if you like jim carrey may i recommend ace ventura if you would like a good movie may i recommend anything but this in fact im having trouble trying to decide which jim carrey movie approached this one in terms of pain and i cant think of one its interesting that one of his worst movies would be one of his best critically acclaimed and popular,black_comedy
back in 1990 at about 3pm i was watching an episode of the twilight zone where a man had caught someone removing a hidden camera from the wall in his house this leads to a series of discoveries such that he is on a television station dedicated solely to showing him and everything he does 24 hours a day furthermore he finds his life has been manipulated they have set him up with a better job and even his marriage and so on  stop me if you heard any of this before obviously on a smaller scale but close to identical the difference being he has benefitted as much as he has lost out in the invasion of privacy maybe even more thereby leading to an intriguing and enigmatic endingthis in itself isnt a problem really however there are problems in this film the foremost one is that as with any long running enterprise of any kind it when things go wrong its quite believable that they occur in a clusterit is not believable that for such a long running and highly controlled operation as that the operators would miss trumans father getting back on the set and him finding people waiting off stage where there should have a lift and not having anything prepared if truman were to ever want to see what his wife does at work what no contigency plan written a long time ago only something thrown together at the last minute that only just works and the policeman at the nuclear accident by name and the truly clumsy fashion cars block his attempts to leave which might as well scream truman youre living in a dome and were all watching you on tvyes things would go wrong and almost inevitably a whole lot at once somewhere along the way but its hard to believe the operators would be so inept so many times in succession over such a short period of time the script falls down in clumsily presenting these scenes instead alternatively have things that dont fit together perfectly the people setting it up only work there truman is living it every day and would spot things they wouldnt but are more subtle with truman picking them up piece by piece and eventually working things out that way becoming gradually aware over time in a much more gradual and subtle fashion than the way that happensed harris is excellent and the way to truman his voice looks like it is literally coming down from the heavens is great jim carrey and the rest of the cast do quite well in the acting departmentof course just to extrapolate from the ending knowing big business the show could go on after the end imagine the interviews with christof the following and documenting of truman in the outside world tours of the dome even the sale of houses inside it inevitably the selection of another child and starting the thing again thered still be money in it allso anyway just remember not bad but could have been better and dont whatever you do call it original almost exactly the same thing has been done maybe as much as 10 years ago or more,black_comedy
i heard so much hype about this film and how superb it wasfour of us watched this film together and we were all of the same opinion and that is that this film was very much overrated  in particular we found the end of the film very poor and openended,black_comedy
its a good movie i guess but once you leave the theater thats it its over the experience is over if a movie doesnt have you talking about it later then it hasnt done its job truman didnt do his job,black_comedy
is a product of the age before reality television really took of and maybe it even contributed to it another movie having a similar concept and effect was edtv10 years ago the concept was original now the whole thing is almost plausible as a television show in fact in germany they had a big brother format in which they had a whole village as their big brother house the main difference to this movie being that the contestants naturally knew that they were on a tvshow but what if they had had babiesso basically this movie is not so original anymore except for the concept the plot is pretty thin actually as most jim carrey movies this one relies a lot on his skills the movie is entertaining because jim carrey is entertainingthis isnt really a comedy and definitely nobody would even consider this a comedy if truman was played by somebody else then carrey,black_comedy
was directed by peter weir in the 1998 its the first serious dramatic role of the striking actor  jim carrey this film is fantastic and dramatic it won the gold globe and the blockbaster entertainmenttruman lives in the town where all the people  actors all that surrounds him is decorations but he doesnt know it this town is a giant studio which had been built by the director of this project truman doesnt understand it up to the day when one woman tells him that everything set up and after that he starts realizing that everything goes by the round everybody in the world observes this show and looks forward to the end of this story they wake up and turn on the tv they go to work and watch this show there they fall asleep with the channel turned on in the end of this story truman finds the exit of this studio in spite of the difficult way thereas for me this film is one of the best films ive ever seen it shows us and our life it shows that a lot of people dont think about another people and think only about entertainment this film shows us insignificance of our life however it shows the strength of will every person too the scenery is beautiful the background music is perfect the brilliant performance makes this film more interesting and breathtaking when you watch this film you willymilly remember the words of celebrated writer  william shakespeare all the worlds a stage and all the men and women merely playersall things considered i can say that this film is a masterpiece i recommend it for everybody who didnt watch it,black_comedy
in 1997 jim carrey had just released liar liar a film that showed his comic ability at its full strength but there was something in him that wanted to change wanted to move on and be brave so ow we have the trueman showthis excellent film shows a man living his life in a television show of his life this is all without him knowing and as he struggles with problems in his life he begins to realise that everything is revolving around him in some waythis is a very good idea for a film and does nothing but interest the viewer rich of laughs and sighsthe first thing about this film that many people will notice is hoe different jim carrey is compared to his previous film h is outstanding in this film and fully deserved his golden globe the acting in general is very good ed harris gave an oscar nominated performance here which was also fully deservedas in many films there are several loop holes but they ban be forgiven as the sheer brilliance of the movie shines through 10 out of 10,black_comedy
i dont know what it was about this movie that made it so great the direction itself was not incredible the extras performances werent stellar but what makes this a true american classic is its emotional connection by the time its finished youll be cheering for truman jim carrey and feeling like youve known him your whole lifeliterallythe films premise is simple but novel truman is a guy who lives in a world thats perfecttoo perfect as time goes on he starts to suspect that something is wrong with that world clues begin popping up that eventually affirm his suspicion that all is not right and for the rest of the film he sets about trying to fix thatjim carrey isnt usually my favourite guy but in this movie he was simply amazing likable funny and easy to empathise with this is easily one of the best performances of his acting career all of his main supporting actors are great too and youll recognise all of themno matter what kind of person you are no matter what kind of movies you like will be enjoyable to you i promise,black_comedy
truman burbank jim carrey is the star of in this 1998 film directed by peter weir trumans life is a fake reality show watched by millions of viewers though he doesnt know that he lives in the small seaside town of seahaven a peaceful place truman is married has a best friend and works as an insurance agent he has an unnatural fear of water after being in a boating accident in which his father diedone day he boards an elevator and it isnt an elevator he sees his dead father in town and a woman has a strange message for him that he doesnt understand he tries to leave town with his wife and it simply doesnt happen the reality if there is one is that truman doesnt really exist the town is fake filled with actors one of whom the man who played his father comes back to make trouble that person on the bicycle the passing car etc thats on a repeating loop he has a public he has never met who follow each phase of life with interest his producer the man who created truman is a man named christof who took an illegitimate child and turned him into a media star when truman tries to get out he realizes just how trapped he iswith todays reality shows abounding today is even more fascinating than it was in 1998 heres a reality show thats not a reality  and it makes you wonder about what were watching on reality shows today it brings up all the metaphysical questions of who am i and who made me the film also asks us to take a look at our attraction to the lives of celebrities where people are merely an image and where we separate the events of their lives from the actual human being for some good gossip after all we only know the persona not the real person and we only know what the media reports not the whole story in the end we have no idea of what britney spears or madonna or brangelina are like as people what they think what their day to day life is like in the movie we know trumans  and his whole story is falseits said that a great comedian can do drama and jim carrey is proof of this giving a brilliant heartfelt performance as truman ed harris is fabulous as christoff the puppeteer who created truman and needs him such a wonderful film it demands a second viewing,black_comedy
huge spoiler my comments is only for those who have watched the film if you havent then im not recommending you to readmaybe the movie itself is not bad but the story is just too way out of this world how could you control ones life in a movie studio there is just no sense of humanity in it what if you were truman how would you feel finding out that your whole life since youre in your moms womb has been inside a studio that is created by another man which has no higher rights at all once again the story is just too unrealistic think about it,black_comedy
would have been a decent film if they took a little more time introducing us to the situation before truman started to notice things  they seemed rushed to get to the end,black_comedy
is truly one of the worst movies that i have ever come across and i dont understand why people think it is good i thought it would be a tv show based off of the title but the creator didnt seem to mind ling to me and the audience the main issue with this film is that it tries to make you feel sad or happy throughout the movie but it completely lacks emotion how am i supposed to care about the movie when the characters are so poorly written and unrelatable the next complaint i have is that the movie never lets the actors get into the role they are supposed to play and on top of this the movie keeps reminding you that they are just actors and there is no reasoning behind this i guess the director jut had no idea what he was doing if you are thinking of watching this do yourself a favor and watch something which is actually good like black mirror i mean that show is basically this entire movie but longer better written and has real emotion put into it,black_comedy
the movie itself is fantastic but it is almost destroyed by careys wannabe acting i am so glad the hype did not catch up to this one and grant him an oscar nod careys acting is so static and insincere it makes you almost sad a greater actor was not cast all jim does is pretend to be someone trapped in an unwitting television reality show he does not act he does not bring any emotion any real emotion at least to the screen the movie itself is saved by a stellar cinematography job and super acting by ed harris the story is great the camera work is great the actingother than careys is great so overall its a very good film just too bad its star is so crap,black_comedy
this is one of those times when i must differ with other reviewers i didnt like this one i support carreys attempt to jump into another genre and the work itself is awesome carreys performance clearly rocks but the whole premise was affronting i frankly hated this movie carreys performance makes it worth the hype but the story itself was a cold calculating cashingin of the talent and i can not find anything enjoyable about thatthis work was clearly intended to make you think it endears you to the main character carrey introduces its premise which was refreshingly new and then lowers the boom it was the boom i couldnt swallow i found this work horribly disturbing and just plain sadfrankly in spite of the glowing reviews and excellent numbers this work received i believe this is the pinpoint of the decline of carreys career i hope he pulls out of it or soon hell just be another washedup comedianit rates a 4610 fromthe fiend ,black_comedy

steve jobs lives on the moon and watches everyone through hidden cameras planted in everyones stuff utter nonsense,black_comedy
if you did not watch this film already  you should  and if you watch this film just one time  you definitely should watch again it is legendary,black_comedy
is an absolute masterpiece i saw it once as a kid and didnt think much of it but rewatching it now i can see its one of the most original and wellcrafted films ive seen in my life everyone gives an amazing performance but the star is undoubtedly jim carrey as truman the attention to detail in this movie is amazing watch it you wont regret it,black_comedy
never watched such a horrible movie why play a role so stupid really a 30 yr old man is clueless to his whole life being a lie pure trash cant believe jim carey embarrassed himself doing this moviei cant even believe it only took me half of the movie to notice how bad the movie was only if i could sue the makers for wasting my time lmaoo,black_comedy
the truman showi think this movie is beyond comedy the message behind it is very strong after watching this movie my thought is suprisingly about god yet this movie is never talk explicitly about religion according to this movie i think yes he has prepared something good for our destiny but it doesnt mean you just accept it because as a human being you have your own will too and no matter how great or bad what you have been through it is just about your own perspective maybe you could say hes gives you that experience because he wants to protect you from the bigger problems out there or maybe you would say he is just control and play at you because he knew every single things about you more than you are,black_comedy
a heartwarming film yet disturbing image of the ideal american life revolves around a man truman burbank played by jim carrey who lives his life unknowingly on a giant television set where his life is and has been broadcasting live ever since he was born 30 years ago throughout the film the director peter weir uses many shots that have a faded black circle around it or use a fisheye lens this is a constant reminder to the audience that truman is secretly being watched and televised there are many other techniques used to help reinforce this idea that truman is trapped in a false world such as unnatural lighting where a spotlight is seen coming from the moon many of the characters will also look directly into the camera which is known as breaking the fourth wall this is seen when truman is talking and looking at the camera through his mirror making it seem as if he is trying to communicate with the audience there are also subtle comedic references that would hint at the fact that they are in a tv show such as trumans closest friend marlon and wife meryl having names that resemble famous actors jim carrey balances comedy and drama well in the film very different from his wellknown roles played in dumb and dumber and ace ventura pet detective overall peter weir does a very good job at portraying how trumans world has been manipulated and controlled throughout his whole life forcing the audience to question their own world and the control they have on it,black_comedy
in a time where the uk has the only way is essex geordie shore and made in chelsea reality tv shows are a massive hit i wish they werent but they are its clear to see why observing the lives of others on a routinely basis makes you feel like you know them on a personal level the same applies to this film truman burbank is unknowingly in a hit reality show where his life and world is fabricated he starts to find odd idiosyncrasies in his day to day routine that makes him question the legitimacy of his world straight up this is jim carreys best film and best performance he controls his usual animated comedic mannerisms to create an understated and emotionally captivating performance peter weirs direction is also compelling utilising hidden cameras in this false reality to enhance the tv showlike qualities making the experience feel real but what really puts on the map is the concept ive seen this a good few times and every single viewing gives me a sense of euphoria the ending might be slightly underwhelming but when we get to the final five minutes its like weve completed a quest me and truman together the narrative evokes many themes the idea of our lives being dictated by a higher power the right to have the freedom of choice exploring the concept of fate and destiny is it subtle no but it doesnt need to be thats the point of the plot i adored the small details that reality shows include like product placements laura linney staring at the camera talking about cocoaits a thing of beauty and kinda makes me want to buy some the natural progression of truman discovering unusual happenings was well paced and all the loose ends were tied up nicely overall a fascinating and enthralling study of reality tv shows with a career best performance from jim carrey,black_comedy
its great to watch jim carreyhe is one of the finest of hollywoodhe has surprised us with many unbelievable movies but this movie will go in history as one of his best worksmust watch for those who loves mystery thriller,black_comedy
truman is a married man whose entire life has been recorded as part of a tv show his show is very popular on the outside world but truman does not know that he eventually finds out that he is part of a show and he quickly realizes that he does not like that whether it be because of the lack of authenticity in his relationships or any other reason you can think of find out if he is able to escape this pretend world or if he would even like to leave it,black_comedy
i am a huge jim carrey fan one of the things that always bothered me was that so many people said he was just a slap stick comedian and not a real actor jim silences those critics in this film the story is perfect the cast is perfect the score is amazing the camera angles make you feel as though youre watching instead of a movie as i say with many films tv programs and video games the true sign of greatness is can it stand the test of time i enjoy today more than i did when i first saw it twenty years ago to me the climax moment of this film is jim carreys greatest moment 10 stars,black_comedy
this was the second time i watched this movie and i like it directed by peter weir and with jim carrey cast as truman this is a surprisingly deep and thoughtprovoking film for having the leading role be a comedian the concept is that this man truman who is a hardworking family man is completely unbeknownst to him the star of a widely televised live series all about his life he slowly learns throughout the movie that his entire life quite literally from birth has been a setup and that the creators of the tv show were always watching him with cameras everywhere controlling and influencing his every move even his wife and best friend play along with the script of the show what horrible loyalty by the end though truman realizes his entrapment and ends the show by leaving the bubbleset made for him as his world by the television directors and it ends up being the grand finale to the show as well as his personal escapethis film could be paralleled to some of the conspiracy theories of today many people think that the government is constantly surveying its citizens and this idea was made famous by the term big brother many people including scientists agree that what we know may not be all there truly is to reality as there is still so much left to discover in the vastness of the universe like truman we may be only seeing the tip of the iceberg only seeing what those with more control and power want us to see at this point and time maybe like truman our true reality will be discovered by us eventually before our creators essentially being the government realize that we are aware of the set matrix and how to break free from it in the movie the television show film crew and directors utilized citizens in all areas of employment to attempt to stay one step ahead of truman finding out the true nature of his reality his entire life was orchestrated from birth his parents essentially allowing him to be this project of sorts for all the world to watch until he figured out that he was the rat in the experiment and put an end to the show there are moral concepts that come into play both with this film and how we can parallel it to our own possible reality for one the idea of using someone as a guinea pig basically and manipulating their whole existence and everyday happenings so that events unfold as the director of the show wishes is crossing the moral boundaries of that persons very right to privacyaired twentyfour hours a day seven days a week the second major moral dilemma in my opinion that ties in with this is that the directors are using this man to earn their own incomes with this television show so of course they want the show to be successful so to achieve their means and to have the script play out how they need it to for the best viewer response in their view they went as far as to kill off trumans father with an artificiallygenerated storm forcing the boy to grow up thinking that he had lost his father when in fact the directors had faked the entire thing to the entertainment and profit of the viewers and tv directors but to the detriment of this human being this boy who experienced this real human loss they are essentially manipulating his entire world until he becomes aware of this and chooses to leave the set ending the show and freeing himself how interesting it is to think what if this kind of thing could really happen to citizens by the government what if the parallel to this movie could be a reality its a scary thought but truman also broke free once he took the time to become aware and notice that he was in this set and to step outside of it into a reality created by only himself,black_comedy

is a film that i heard about and sort of put off watching it for awhile this was a monumental mistake as this is a subtle classic and starts well and ends well right now at least this is probably my favorite movie i am only rating this 8 because i do not like giving something my highest rating and have not done so at the time of this review i really loved this film and everything about it is amazing if you have not watched it watch it it is great there are a few continuity errors however but they are not noticeable and do not detract from the rest of the film watch this film,black_comedy
the concept for this film alone is very intriguing but the way it is executed and how the themes that it presents are explored is quite brillianttruman slowly discovering that something quite odd is going on in the world he lives in starting off with the studio light falling from the sky and how he starts to lose his wits end is a fascinating aspect to the film which jim carrey portrays very well the themes of runaway celebrity culture and the fake nature of reality tv are subtly yet humorously traversed particularly with the blatant product placement that is featured in the show this is what makes this film so great in how it integrates these thoughtprovoking ideas into the narrativethe artificial nature of trumans life and how that is created is outstanding such as how his eventual wife is chosen for him by the shows producers and how he is always subtly encouraged to never leave seahaven so the show can continue to air if certain cast members try to reveal to truman what his life really is then they are swiftly whisked away prompting the question of the morality of the decision to keep a man effectively in a prison away from the real world with his entire life being a liethe final scene in the film is a truly great piece of cinema with how the shows creator christof tries to persuade truman to not leave the set before truman replies with his catchphrase if i dont see ya good afternoon good evening and goodnight before bowing and walking off this is such a euphoric and emotionallysatisfying ending that is makes the filmin terms of performances i dont understand how jim carrey didnt get an oscar nomination for his performance it may be one of the greatest injustices of 90s cinema ed harris is also brilliant in the short amount of screen time he has as christof and deserved his oscar nomination for best supporting actoroverall its simply a great piece of 90s cinema,black_comedy
ok amazing acting check amazing cast eh amazing ok the plot and when everything comes tougher it comes out a classic,black_comedy
when you yes you when you were a child did you think that your life is tv show this movie brings that on the big screen with amazing acting and plot that your childhood needs with comedy now even scientists call the effect thinking that you live in a tv show the truman effect still a great movie,black_comedy
is like a mirror of our postmodern world and the way we maintain our lives how can we know that we are not being watched or controlled the problem is that truman has the courage and confidence to leave the world behind to chase after the truth and original that doesnt mean that everyone has that courage we are used to see the things as they are and we accept the world the way it is presented very few people try to find the meaning of our essence and how the truth can be found in the deep oceans we know that the place truman lives is a simulation but when we turn and look our world we cant see any difference between seaheaven and the world we live in the bed we sleep the chair we sit or the book we read are just a simulacrum we dont attempt to look for the original because the copies become the reality and that doesnt bother us at all truman burbank is the man who cannot make shift with the visible or knowable he is brave and courageous enough to look for the light and truth,black_comedy
when i first watched this i had no idea what it was about and the very beginning of the movie i was so confused then as the movie got further i started to understand what it was about ive only seen it once but i plan on watching it again soon so sorry if i mess up some things in this review i forgot about some things in the movie this movie is about a man named truman who thinks that his life is simple and boring he then discovers that his life is actually a tv show wow thats a sad thing to find out  there are so many things i liked about this movie i liked that i can really relate to it there have been times where maybe i thought that what if my life isnt really what i think it is what if people have hidden secret cameras everywhere i go can anyone other than god see me when i use the bathroom or see me when i go to sleep another thing i liked about the movie if i can remember correctly is that truman never actually gets angry about finding out his life is a tv show instead he seems to be trying to curiously figure out why this would be happening to him he shows the audience that he knows what is going on and seems to be almost challenging them   like i said its been a while since ive seen it but i remember it pretty well i cant wait to watch it again,black_comedy
its not perfect but its probably the closest movie we can get i really like the idea of the world revolving around me cause at one point i had a same thought in my headthe story is pretty generic the main character is kindhearted he fell into all the staged setups and eventually discovers that hes getting fooled if the story wasnt generic it may have gone weird so i prefer the generic lifestyleabout the extrarole people repeating same thing it wouldnt have took him 22 years to notice that for 10000 days theyll have tons of variations and dramas going on within the town also the advertisement wouldnt been subtle without actors vocally pointing it outthe television rating wouldnt have been high as well probably first year and last year of his life the scale of staffs involved wouldve been much larger theyll be prepared for any situation and the townspeopled be really just living in there not even acting as a part,black_comedy
this is an intriguing film truman is in his mid or late 20s when we get to him in the present the idea is that he was one of several children born from mothers who gave away their children for adoption at birth he was the first one to be born and as such became adopted by the corporation represented by christof the director or this show suspend your disbelief a lot because the fact that he lived in this artificial cinema setting all his life which means went to school on a daily basis and to college to get his qualification for his job is a pure illusionary impossibility it is maybe easier to make a few hundred people live in this community with only one real inhabitant truman and all the others actors who have to be unionized in a way or another and hence cannot work more than a certain certainly limited number of hours a day and a week and a month and a year and what about the population of a school from grade 1 to grade 12 not to speak of the full population of a college i will not consider the legal side of things this abduction and total retention of a minor and then an adult in an artificial environment is pure imprisonment which means totally illegal and when christof says truman could leave anytime he wanted it is an absolute lie since when truman finally tries he is nearly killed by christofs own decisions and acts that amounts to the inhumane torturing of a grown up by another grownup with a whole bunch of accomplices pushing the buttons this has to be said because everything in this show is real really real not just truman but all the others they are maybe a fake illusion for truman but they are real actors and actresses really acting on command prompted by earplugs in constant relation with the studio instances of christofs dictating to an actor what he had to say is even provided it is all an illusion and a delusion for truman but it is all true and i repeat totally impossible because beyond any material credibility and whats more beyond any human rights as for truman and in fact as for everyone in the film apart from truman they all behave either as criminals or accomplices of criminalsbut we have to accept to enter the film to find a deeper meaning in the storythe first element is the delusional world in which truman is forced to live it has one motto written on a couple of arches unus pro omnibus omnes pro uno this motto is old and was first used within some religious conflict in bohemia in 1618 it is also a traditional motto in switzerland but not in latin in german einer fr alle alle fr einen in french un pour tous tous pour un in italian uno per tutti tutti per uno and in romansch in per tuts tuts per in the motto is generally translated into english as one for all all for one it is particularly famous because it is the motto of the famed and heroic though hilarious three musketeers staged by alexandre dumas along with dartagnan this motto is immediately visually amplified by the name of the store on the corner of the street in front of these arches omnicol though i do not know what this store might be sellingthis motto is very ethical and is obviously in full contradiction with real life where it is always everyone for oneself this community seahaven the very well named place because it is a haven and even a heavenly haven to its residents imagine keeping up with this illusion that this is a harbor le havre in france on a sea with no possible traffic ships and even the ferry is only a prop on the set the only boat ever really shown is the boat in which trumans father will die in a storm in front of trumans eyes and then at the end the second boat will be trumans escape boat in which he will nearly die by the decision of christof himself who could not accept the escape with a cynical remark of his that sounds like a death sentence network executive for gods sake chris the whole world is watching we cant let him die in front of a live audience christof he was born in front of a live audienceat this moment christof himself is showing the reverse motto everyone is supposed to do what he wants even truman who may die if necessary to satisfy the selfish ambition of the power freak and the control freak christof is his name is the very antagonistic reference to christ  he is an antichrist  who is supposed to die for everyone and not the reverse in fact he is more like ponce pilate thus turning truman into the christ of the story to be sacrificed for the interest of the show that is supposed not to die since the show must go on as shakespeare said a long time ago but this is a film and thats what makes the show a pure fable the director of the film systematically creates a distance between trumans experience and ours the audiences experience of trumans fate the public is shown as having a tremendous level of empathy for that young man who is going to be sacrificed on the altar of a reality tv show    dr jacques coulardeau,black_comedy
the idea behind the movie is by far one of the best ones in the history of cinema and the director made an excellent job in developing it using cameras in absurd but impressive waysgreat performances by jim carrey and ed harris if only the other actors had been at the same leveland the ending is just perfect i actually stopped and started applauding this movie is definitely a must see and i actually feel awful for having waited so long dont do the same mistake,black_comedy
this movie is about a person called truman whose life is monitored 247 and streamed as a live broadcast to the whole world since his birth under a shows title that is the idea is original and i dont suppose it has ever been represented beforewhats coming next is the plot summary in other words no spoilers intended this protagonist of ours he lives his life spontaneously as if everyone does so as well but they turn out to be just a controllable part of the show but what if truman finds it fishy and starts to wonder is this really my life or someone is controlling it you see the messages are deep you cant manipulate someones life and a few morethe ending is open it may the solution but you never know8510,black_comedy
before there were reality shows while im sure it wasnt intended this movie is the perfect spoof of all reality shows and demonstrates just how ridiculous they really aretruman is a man who was enlisted at birth to be the sole focus of a new wave in television a 247 reality show that runs continuously over his lifetime the whole world watches his progress throughout this scripted life where trumans every move becomes a fanatical obsession with viewerstruman becomes suspicious of the ploy and begins to be disillusioned seeking ways to exit this created world that has boundariesas a different movie it shines but as an epic it falls shortit does however make you wonder about our link to television and how it has taken over our lives,black_comedy
when i first saw i came out of the theatre amazed this is your first clue that you are watching something different from your normal jim carrey movie i love the dialogue camera shot performances direction music and running time of this movie there is nothing i would do to change it i came away from feeling inspired which is the goal of good filmmaking jim carrey was outstanding as truman underplaying him not making him too comic or too dramatic but giving true sincerity when asked he deserved an oscar nomination ed harris has always been a good actor but in this movie hes a great actor he plays christof with such arrogance and bullheadedness that you dont know whether hes helping or destroying truman he and the director peter weir deserved their oscar nods,black_comedy
is one of the best psychological thrillers because of its concept choice of actors filming and script as i watched this movie i was blown away by how interesting it actually was i find psychology incredibly interesting so this movie was great to me the entire concept of this movie is about a man truman who has spent his whole life growing up on a movie set his parents arent his real parents his lovers arent his real lovers and his house isnt his own house yet he has no idea that these people around him are all actresses and hes living in a fake world the real outside world is watching through hidden cameras placed everywhere on this movie set that he calls his life his entire life truman is being watched 247 and the outside world watches him as a reality tv show every move he makes every emotion he feels and everything he sees and experiences is purely for the outside worlds entertainment the reason he was placed in this fake world purely for entertainment was because he was chosen from an unwanted pregnancy there were six unwanted pregnancies and he was the first born so he was the first chosen by the corporation producingi really enjoyed watching jim carrey play truman because as truman began to experience signs that he was living in this fake world it kind of turned into comedy i love watching jim carrey because he never fails to make people laugh hes done a ton of comedies including dumb and dumber liar liar bruce almighty dr seuss how the grinch stole christmas and many others carrey accepted this role even though he was getting paid 12 million less than what he usually gets paid for films im glad he did though because i cant imagine the movie with anyone other than him playing the face of truman jim carrey tends to do a lot of improvising on set which is exactly what he did during this movie he didnt agree with some of the parts of the scripts and he would change things he did and said last minute as they were filming obviously as i was watching this movie i couldnt help but notice how it was filmed i really enjoyed how this film other than the fact that it takes a while to understand what is going on in the movie many people may get half way through the movie and finally come to the realization that his whole life is being filmed as a reality tv show however its also really intriguing how it is filmed its filmed in the perspective of hidden cameras the angles are different than normal movies and a corporation logo appears in the corner of the screen in most scenes of the movie this really showed how he was being filmed without him knowing it gave the movie more of a reality tv show feeling than a formal movie which makes situations that happen more shocking the script is very well written in my opinion because it makes you feel every core emotion you laugh you feel sad for him you get angry at how they treat him and you feel excited for him as the movie starts out he has no idea hes being filmed however as the movie goes on he begins to realize and pick up on peculiar things that are happening to him characters in the movie start to feel sorry for him and try and warn him that hes being played he starts to pick up on all these clues and try to figure out how he can overcome his fear of the water to potentially escape the only way out of this tv set is to escape past the water but unfortunately for him he has developed a strong fear for water when he was younger his father died in the water so hes never tried to travel past it this was their way of putting fear in his head so he would never want to escape this tv set if he ever found out about what was going on he eventually has the courage to get through the water on a boat which leads him to the door to exit the tv set this movie provided such a thrill factor that i havent seen in many other movies before watching him experience his situations and get past them is exactly why i believe it is one of the best psychological thrillers that exists,black_comedy
he is doing really great job and we saw that thing in this movie i love it and i really enjoyedmovie reminds me that may be we are the same position like truman why not i was not bored any second and i recommended this movie very hard,black_comedy
i felt the main target of this movie is modern entertainment we are obsessed with reality tv and celebrity drama was the ultimate reality tv show the stereotypes in the movie made it more humorous it is comical to a viewer that truman is unaware of the cookiecutter stereotypical life he lives as he has not been exposed to real culture he lives only inside his bubble there are many examples of sarcasm in truman himself is often sarcastic for example when he is pretending to act normal i do find it ironic that hollywood made a movie about how obsessive and idolizing celebrities is so normalized in society but they are the ones promoting that because it makes them money just like christof in all in all i believe to be an excellent piece of satire and a wonderful movie,black_comedy
the movie was a very enjoyable movie to watch i really enjoyed the plot and the acting of jim carrey as he plays the main character truman in the movie i really liked how real they made the movie feel and how they didnt reveal the entire plot until about halfway through the movie the whole point that the movie was trying to get across to people was a very good point that applies very well to our lives now with all of the advancements in technology and the large growth of social media you can some what tell that this story is satirical because of how inflated the concept of the movie is but it is more of a horatian satire than a juvenalian because of the humor that occurs in the story and that there is no direct target that the movie goes after there wasnt really any movies or television shows that this movie reminded me of because most of the other satirical shows and parodies are either juvenalian satires or just comedic parodies that dont really suggest change like the truman movie does i believe that this is why the movie won so many awards in conclusion i really enjoyed watching the truman movie and i think it is a very good movie to watch because of how relevant it is in our world today,black_comedy
people rave about this film it pops up regularly on their best film listsi ask the question why because lets be honest its a one joke idea that is strung out for all its worth over the 99 minute running timei cant fault jim carrey he plays his part well but what the script really needed was somewhere else to go there are questions you have while watching this film that you think oh theyll answer that in a minute but they dont preferring instead to cover the same old groundi was surprised to see that peter weir dead poets society directed this because although that film was longer it had more fresh ideas than this film manages in less timepeople rave about this film i wont be joining them,black_comedy
is an amazing movie that shows many satirical elements the film is addressing is reality tv in reality tv shows things happen that wouldnt normally happen in somebody in normal day to day life the target then would be the people who run these reality tv show and change the way events happen on the show for ratings for instance there is product placement in trumans life these show how the world is fake and this addresses the fact that tv is fake commercials that talk about how great their product is when in reality the person is payed to say what they do another thing is the deflation of all the problems in the world the only problems that usually happen are minor but when truman goes to leave the town for fiji all sorts of problems arrive i think that this is attacking the fact that reality shows start problems when things start to drag there is a lot of deflation when it comes to the fact that they essentially are keeping a human in captivity for entertainment which obviously immoral there is also lots of irony when truman sees the elevator is fake there is an elevator crash the next day as well as that his wife is a nurse but she is grossed out by surgery with his whole life a lie we can see the impact not only of the lies on television but the impact every action we make on other peoples lives whether the impact was good or bad this is still relevant to us today not only because tv is still around and these things constantly happen there but because humans still interact with each other with their actions impacting those around them and their lives making this a must see for all,black_comedy
is a comical and deep thinking satire taking a shot at how much the media plays a role in our views of the world ironically peter weir reveals this to you from the media in the movie during the movie their is a live interview with the creator of the show and when questioned on the morality of the show he replies with we accept the world we are presented this is a huge line in the movie as it is a clue to the underlying theme during the interview there is deflation because he is saying something such as power of the media doesnt have much power but it actually has a lot of power another literary device seen would be the use of would be blame by praise although having some people against it mostly has an audience in love with the show the show is praised along with the idea of the media all this praise is once again just another clever mask that weir uses to cover up the blame he is actually intending this movie can very easily be tied to todays world media has more input on our decisions more than ever so many news channels have reports and studies meant to influence the publics thoughts on their world around them we are seeing this a whole lot right now as there is a presidential debate going on it seems like every day theres a different poll on who is leading and has more supporters,black_comedy
review imdb director peter weir main role jim carreya cheerful movie with optimism hope  power of an individual i really enjoyed this tragicomedy with spiritual core the plot is an allegory of a spiritual reality which is created for the protagonist  and read between lines  for every and each human being in accordance to develop his consciousness ie a soulthe one man show is revealing a huge investment and effort of a higher world director of the show and his crew in the movie into a human being as well as humans challenges to get rid of the illusion of the tough magnetism of materialistic reality young and charming jim carrey is awesome in the role of truman burbank that character is probably the most positive role of jim carreythe culmination of the movie was when the director of the show dramatically increased the volume of the storm and truman almost died in the waves this could be considered as an allegory of a spiritual challenge and burbanks victorythe end is open what will happen the next to this guy this movie is a wonderful sample how a very complex spiritual idea could be implemented into entertaining movie bravo,black_comedy
truman burbankjim carrey is a unsuspecting star of a television show named with billions of viewers around the clock the show started even before he was born with thousands of cameras all around him hes lifes being broadcasted 247 and everyone around him his family and all his friends being actors so the director christofed harries can guide truman through his life but truman starts to suspect that something is wrongto try and stop truman from finding out the true nature of his life christof have started several disincentives for truman like drowning his father in a boating accidentthe set is on island surrounded by water constantly running news reports on how dangerous it is to travel and shows stating how good it is to be home even with christofs control truman falls in love with an extra named sylvianatascha mcelhone who truman knows as lauren instead of his designated wife meryllaura linney but sylvia quickly gets thrown of set with the excuse that her family is moving to fiji truman marries meryl but still loves sylvia in secret during the 30th year of the show running truman starts to notice weird things about his perfect life like almost getting crushed by a falling light the car radio pickups the camera crews radio broadcast following him around and he sees his dad who snuck on to the set so truman sets out to find out about his true nature even though marlonnoah emmerich his best friend tries to talk him out of iti never really liked jim carreys overreacting i just thought it was annoying and cringe worthy at best but hes acting in this movie was much better than usual and with great acting from the supporting actors like ed harris laura linney noah emmerich natascha mcelhone and more they made this movie a good time watching the movie is reality television on drugs foresees the current reality televisions mania i have to say that the movie was a overall great movie watching experience i strongly recommend this movie,black_comedy
dares to question the reality its original complex and philosophical it manages to make you feel truly frustrated and claustrophobic perhaps many of us can relate to truman as we live in a time of routines we often live our lives without giving a second thought to the simplicity and meaninglessness of life itself our limited perspectives keep us from seeing the lies we are told keep us from the truth if we could push the boundaries of our reality what are the odds that wed face what truman faced in the endit was a joy to watch jim carrey as truman it is yet another proof that jim isnt just a comedian,black_comedy
i have always been a jim carrey fan ever since he jumped from in living color to the big screen the one thing that i loved about him was his abilities to make others laugh with ease and how much he enjoys what he does now that being said i went into this film expecting to laugh the entire time half way through i realized that was not going to happen and i was ok with that the way that this film puts a focus on love as well as the concept of being trapped in you own world is amazing at the end after crying a little laughing a little you have to ask yourself am i the focus of this world that i live in in conclusion i would recommend this film to any variety of spectators young old and anything in between,black_comedy
is a juvenalian satire because it focuses on the greed of people they kept a person from a very young age in a fake world all for the purpose of entertainment and profit the purpose of this is to show that people shouldnt sacrifice other people for their own gain the director was holding someone prisoner without knowing about the outside world except for what he read onlinewas an incredible movie that shows what happens when human greed and boredom go too far a young child and then furthermore man was held prisoner for the purpose of other peoples entertainment this movie shows why we should never by into reality tv even today no tv will ever be true reality this movie illustrates that truman started to discover that he wasnt living in the real world this ruined the effect of the show for the outside viewers hes starting to realize that this isnt reality,black_comedy
1998 stars jim carrey as truman the everyday good neighbor in an idyllic seaside town unbeknownst to him his reality is being controlled from behind the scenes truman begins to notice subtle cues that things arent as perfect as they appear to be points out our social desire to watch reality television to the extreme and shows the audience just how staged it all isallows the audience to see jim carrey in a serious role often he has made serious points throughout his career but always with a comedic edge he tames his comedic expressions in order to appear the quintessential everyday normal man and yet is able to endear truman to the hearts of the audiencewhen trumans father attempts to tell him its not real he is removed from the cast of the show truman is told that he died at sea this reinforces the fear of the open ocean that christof the director of ed harris wants to instill in truman the final goal is to keep truman contained in college truman meets lauren natascha mcelhone who falls in love with him and plans on revealing the truth again christof intervenes and she is removed from the show when truman fights with his wife laura linney a new love interest appears his best friend marlon noah emmerich appears to be more and more dangerous as he comes closer to the truth truman feels he is descending into madness he counts how often the same car drives by to make his point stranger than fiction 2006 also follows this line as a seemingly normal man begins to hear his life narratedstarts off with a great deal of openness and lighting everyday appears to be a perfect sunny day as truman begins to notice things the lighting starts to get darker we see this when he tries to escape and is confronted by marlon and later in the storm sequence the lighting leads the audience to see just how unreal trumans reality is the openness changes as the film progresses early on the film uses wide shots showing the audience that the town itself is a character as the movie progresses the shots begin to tighten in around truman yet even then the audience sees the enormity of trumans obstacles in the final storm sequence the camera pulls away from truman and shows just how small he is against a seemingly vast ocean when trumans illusion of reality crumbles he is finally free and no longer confined to a staged script,black_comedy
89 the movie that set carrey apart from all his other roles up to that point and shed some light on the idea of he being more than just a loud rubber faced jester but an actual actor this is a great film that took me more than one sitting to fully appreciate mainly because i was expecting an outandout carrey comedy not a dramatic mindbender with a fantastic highconcept premise the premise itself is handled perfectly and could have been very easily been ruined by a lesser writer or director the use of music is brilliant and there is a lot of subtly combined in the bolder elements making this a rewarding sit that can be enjoyed again and again,black_comedy
the movie is a satire about media and how self absorbed people get in it and how much it can become their entire life truman the star of this film is a literal example of this trumans life is a reality show everything about him and everything he does gets broad casted to the entire world becoming peoples topic of obsession the people who watch the show follow it habitually the purpose of this movie is to target the entertainment industry and show them how ridiculous they are getting it inflates the overall obsession of people to this show to reveal that people do this regularly without thinking about it and without realizing how deep their obsession runs this movie is still pertinent today because no matter how crazy it seems the way people follow tv shows has gotten worse to where they follow them almost religiously we have so many shows that are like this it is a major feat to count how many there are tv has become an addiction worse than any drug and no one really realizes how bad it is until something like comes around and throws it in your face and says youre gonna take this and youre gonna enjoy it,black_comedy
is an excellent movie that uses many different literary tools of satire to improve the storyline it uses tools such as irony deflation and target effectively within the plot it uses irony to illustrate how he cant leave the island because hes afraid of water yet at the same time yearns to travel this is highlighted throughout the entire movie as he considers leaving to travel and find a certain someone the other bit of irony found is when the director says that truman can leave at anytime if he really wished to however you see that he is blocked at every turn trying to figure out what is going on and trying to leave its also a blame by praise thing the director of the show and everyone who watches doesnt see truman as being free to live his own life making the viewer realize that he really isnt in charge of his own life at all no matter what the people behind the camera want you to think in fact the people behind the camera are the ones controlling his lifeto go along with that they downplay important values that are essential or at least taken for granted by us values such as freedom to do what you want privacy and the right to your own life his life is not his own essentially yet he is deceived into thinking it is i feel that the target of this piece of satire is audiences who take for granted the freedoms that they are given such as the freedom to your own life and the freedom to your privacy,black_comedy
is an amazing movie that makes you think of how we live our lives differently with the main problem being that the main character is trapped in the same town by a fear of water where the whole world watches the every second of his life the purpose of the film is to show how the media can manipulate peoples lives its ironic how hollywood would be displaying promoting this message when they do the opposite the movie really inflates the importance of being yourself while deflating the idea of having a life where you act on the will of others it targets other sources of media who manipulate events of peoples lives including plenty of bias on their opinions the audience of this movie could be the general public to raise awareness of the problem but also other mediums of media to show them how they can affect people in an extreme way the satirical technique of ethos and pathos are used very often in the film such as how the viewers see the wrongness of how seahaven is using him without consent to make lots of money and popularity from a tv show overall i really enjoyed the movies point of view on the subject and how the director portrays the message as a movie taking place on an enormous movie set,black_comedy
jim carrey plays the perfect persona for a problem that has become even more pertinent since this movie came out in 1998 playing a man growing up in a made up city run by a tv show that broadcasts his life is the much more literal and inflated idea of the media controlling everything the public sees weir targets the media and how they never give anyone any privacy he shows this very literally in trumans world by showing his every movement and letting the whole world see it the plot is a great use of horatian satire to add the right amount of funny and light heartedness while also addressing the very real problem it makes you laugh but also cheer for truman while he tries to find out the real truth of his world the emotional connotations bring you closer to what truman feels and how life changing an experience he is going through you can see the fear and anger going through truman as he finds out more and more about world you can also see this fear in the director of but for a very different reason the fear he might lose the person he has grown up controlling and directing the deflation of trumans right to privacy can go hand in hand with what can happen in todays world it may not be on the same level of the public watching your every move but today people can always be in contact with each other and see what everyone else is doing through social media and cell phones overall is a fantastic story that can be enjoyed at a simple level while you can laugh at trumans world but also enjoy it at a much much deeper level where his predicament can stand for much more serious real world problems that have become even more true 16 years after it was made,black_comedy
the goal of this piece is to point out how violating reality television can be the movie shows a great example of inflation as truman was essentially a prisoner that was used for entertainment this movie is extremely satirical as it has dark undertones throughout even the way the actors had product placement was slightly unnerving a good example of the unnerving feeling the audience gets as well as of irony was when trumans best friend was being fed lines and said i would never lie to you truman it also is there to emphasize just how cruel the entertainment community can bethis satire also shows that not everyone can be trusted as even trumans supposed loved ones were just actors being paid to interact with him it makes the audience think about who is in their life and if theyre really there for them the target for this move is people who watch reality shows or shows that exploit the ignorance of one or more participants these shows however entertaining still are using the ignorance of one participant to entertain the masses there was an illusion to god at the end when the creator started talking to truman im not quite sure if the purpose was to cause an existential crises but that is how it affected me as an individual it was very powerful because the man who had protected truman since the beginning was the only thing standing between his escape lastly the most powerful and well used instance of irony was that all of the people who religiously watched were the ones who cheered when he escaped,black_comedy
was about a man that has lived his whole life in front of a live audience truman burbank has the most recognizable face in the world he is the biggest television star in the world people all over the world watch him live his life the only thing is that truman doesnt know it truman has been legally adopted by a tv network and lives his life in a huge tv set in a dome with its own manmade weather sun moon and even its own manufactured ocean he is being watched constantly 24 hours a day by 5000 hidden cameras everyone that lives in his town of seahaven is an actor including his best friend mother and wife truman was born to be a starhis manufactured world beings to unravel around him after the producers and crew behind the show make a series of mistakes that make truman question everything,black_comedy
is a very entertaining and eyeopening satirical movie about a man whose life has been secretly recorded and broadcasted to the world 24 hours a day this film targets reality tv stars producers and its audience the star of the show truman burbank has no idea that his life has been recorded and televised since the day he was born and that his entire life including the very city he has grown up in is a lie inflates the scale of reality tv today but not by that much honestly though this movie was created a while ago now but it is still just as relevant in todays society as it was then if not even more pertinent with shows like jersey shore and big brother reality tv has become a large part of our lives today but we never really stop to think about the people on tvs privacy our generation has become so desensitized to knowing everything about celebrities that we never stop to think about how the celebrities must feel these stars are no less of people than the rest of us and really opens your eyes to that fact,black_comedy
tells the story of truman burbank who unknowingly plays the main character in a tv show all about his life themes of the movie including how the media influences our thinking the perversity of advertisements and the lack of privacy we have in our day to day lives although inflated draws many parallels to our lives today making it more watchable now than when the film first came out the direction that the producers want to send truman in is made clear through thinly masked dialog when truman starts to reach his midlife crisis and want to travel his friend marlon tells him that you dont have to leave home to find out what life is all about todays news stories are being targeted here based on how they typically lean in one direction or another rather than report only facts airs 24 hours a day 7 days a week with a broadcast schedule like this there is no time for advertisements so advertisements are worked into trumans life marlon is never present without a beer in hand and trumans wife is constantly promoting kitchen and gardening tools right in front of him to see this on the show seems a little ridiculous but from giant billboards to short ads before youtube videos there arent a whole lot of adfree places in our lives today as the main character of truman burbank is on camera a lot meaning he doesnt have a whole lot of privacy when the shows creator christof is being interviewed the interviewer thanks him for the opportunity saying we know how much you value your privacy its ironic how this man values his own privacy so much but can allow truman to go on without any today we have a lot of issues with privacy namely with the nsa monitoring scandals these reasons are why i would suggest watching the movie if you havent seen it and why i would suggest rewatching it now if you havent recently,black_comedy
is a 1998 film starring jim carrey that emphasizes the unfortunate circumstance of our own views of a perfect world the main character truman burbank stars in a wildly popular television show about the pictureperfect little town of seahaven which resides inside a large dome in hollywood california the ultimate goal is to entertain the general public by filming the life of one citizens entire life without having been given consent to do so therefore everyone in the town is an actor and everyone in the world knows about it except truman is an example of many satirical aspects including a central problem irony and connotation the movie goes into great depth about how trumans life seemed so perfect to everyone until he finds out and he does not find it so perfect in our society everyone believes everyone elses lives are so much more perfect than their own this is highlighted in the way that the movie directors have no idea why truman is so anxious to get out once he starts to uncover the truth additionally we find ourselves heavily identifying with truman and feeling his same pain as he struggles to break free of the world that was created around him the world revolved around him and it was all that he wanted to escape the directors of the in the movie often disregard the fact that truman is human not a caged animal to be observed they also fail to realize that his fighting for his freedom is more ethical than them trying to keep it away from him indeed they often make it seem like the end of is the end of the world but its only the end of truman burbanks involvement in a world that was never real is an excellent outlet for realizing and correcting our own human flaws of ideas of perfection and the lengths to which we will go to quench our own entertainment needs,black_comedy
sheds light on the flaws in the perfect society conceived by many people throughout time it shows how this kind of utopia is not what the human race needs and in a way how when we have all the things we need we find issues with it and other things to desire the film possessed various elements of satire using a strong persona tone hyperbole and irony trumans tone and view at the beginning was basically the view of people that think this society is possible and a good idea towards the end his tone changes which propels the audience to continue to agree with the movies creators or to change their mind completely in the film they also use hyperbole in the case of how much all these people care about this random guys life and they over exaggerate the perfect sunshiny place that truman lives in although this movie is about sixteen years old it definitely still applicable to our society today now it relates to not only watching peoples lives on tv like keeping up with the kardashians but with social media whether you are watching people you know on instagram twitter etc or if you are following the lives of people you do not know on youtube or vine although this takes on a much different purpose could be related to the hunger games in the way that there is a central power that controls everything and the weathercontrolled camera monitored dome is very similar to the arena used in the hunger games overall i liked and it shows how these seemingly perfect utopias cannot exist while being a fun lighthearted film,black_comedy
a straight shot into my alltime favourites an excellent satire of reality television  an impressive demonstration of the power of media is one of the most original creative  thoughtprovoking ideas to surface on the silver screen and wonderfully balances its elements of comedy with drama to deliver a cinema thats as entertaining as it is enlighteningchronicles the life of truman burbank whose entire life has been nothing but a 24x7 running tv show the city he lives in is a huge studio with hidden cameras everywhere  the people he interacts with on a daily basis are paid actors but when a series of events force him to question the world around him truman embarks on a quest to discover the truthwritten by andrew niccol  directed by peter weir the best thing about is that unlike many highconcept films of its genre it manages to keep itself grounded throughout its runtime and with its lighthearted narration easily penetrates into the minds of even the most casual viewers without for once compromising with its entertainment factorthe production design is no short of amazing as the entire city resonates a sense of artificiality like a movie set yet has a certain realism to it cinematography makes expert use of camera angles by capturing the events from different point of views thus adding more authenticity to the plot editing keeps the drama flowing smoothly  music also manages to make its presence feltcoming to the performances the film features an interesting cast in jim carrey laura linney ed harris  others and stepping aside from his typecast roles carrey surprises everyone with a dense dramatic  wellbalanced performance that is truly heartwarming ed harris plays the shows creator who really cares about truman in his own way but loves his show too  harris did a terrific job in capturing both sides of his characteron an overall scale is a stellar work of quality whether you put it in the genre of comedy sciencefiction drama or all at once  is equally effective as a meditation on the various themes it deals with be it religion philosophy artificiality or existentialism a heartfelt hilarious  satirical take on the absurdity of reality television is one of the finest examples of how to blend art with entertainment in order to make it work for the masses highly recommended,black_comedy
these days it may be hard to believe that peter weirs arrived at a time before reality tv was a household phrase in the movie jim carrey plays truman burbank a man oblivious to the fact that his entire life is actually a tv show enjoyed by billions around the world however at 30 years old truman is beginning to suspect that all is not as it seems which is a serious problem for the producers of the showthe staggering rise in popularity of reality tv has made it easy to accept the premise of that viewers would take an interest in the life of a relative nobody is now an indisputable fact although carreys dramatic chops may not be quite as developed as they would later become he effortlessly supplies the type of personality that characterizes reality tv starsapart from carrey the highlight of the cast is the always dependable ed harris as the mastermind behind while i find the character to be written almost too enigmatically harris nevertheless plays it with utmost gravity  precision laura linney is also excellent as trumans effervescent wife and there are some notable names in small roles as well such as harry shearer paul giamatti  philip baker hallvisually the movie has an interesting look with plenty of odd angles and lenses to represent the surreptitious filming of trumans daily activities the sets  cinematography are usually bright and idyllic which is all part of the shows controlled reality weirs direction landed him his fourth oscar nomination of six to date the golden globewinning score by philip glass  burkhard von dallwitz also deserves mentionoverall is an entertaining movie that blends comedy drama and soft science fiction that being said i think that subsequent events have robbed the movie of some of its novelty it was arguably too prophetic for its own good when it comes to the mechanics of marketing reality as entertainment its still interesting and worth watching but the story isnt as fanciful as it once was of course others may have the exact opposite opinion  that the movies remarkable vision makes it more effective today than ever before both opinions are equally valid i think,black_comedy
a movie is worth watching if it shakes you or simply remains in your mind hours and hours after the show ends is one such thoughtprovoking piece of artwork that remains with you for long after the curtain falls it is not a comedy but a satire on the life of a common man the man that does not look beyond the obvious the man who continues to live within artificial boundaries the man who does not open his eyes and seeks the truth the man who does not see that this world is fake the man on whose expense the world is having a laugh we all have planted ourselves in the fake daily routines and have stopped looking beyond perhaps it is time to book the flight to fiji,black_comedy
when i rate films or shows on imdb i rate them on what i think they should bethis film staring jim carrey is one of the best films he is in he is quite serious in this which is what i like about this film as he is not just a goof like in liar liar which is a good film as well the creator of the tv show jim carrey stars in is not quite right in the head in my opinion which is what makes this film in a way creepymy mum said that i had to sit down and watch this as it was like a film that i was telling her about and that film was pleasntville which again is another great filmtruman show810,black_comedy
it is a great movie making one think about the reality of life a powerful allegory displayed by the tv show in which everything is fake pushes us to ponder about own world the conversation between the director and truman is the best scene of movie as it compares the real life with the fiction one of truman truman choosing to leave the show seemingly steps into liberty but is it soin addition i see similarities between the frequently used cave allegory of plato and this movie the shadow of real life surrounds truman and he is not aware of this situation until some production errors occur after that time he seeks a way to break free from this artificial world,black_comedy
i thoroughly enjoyed the film starring jim carrey this role is arguably one of his best some parts are comical others are suspenseful and some are just touching the audience cheers truman on his journey toward discovery one of the reasons why truman is such a great protagonist is because he is so relatable i mean just in my life i can think of numerous ways that i relate to the character sometimes i feel like everyone is watching me some days ill continuously look over my shoulder expecting some nutball to be standing behind me waiting to slash me up with an axe i started carrying a hatchet with me everywhere i go now for protection i have had continued suspicion that my wife is out to get me sometimes i catch her spying on me throughout the day she tells me im being paranoid but i know what shes up to shes out to get me i just know it shell rue the day she crosses mei also caught myself relating to audience sometimes i can become extremely nosy and invasive into other peoples lives i have several of my friends email passwords and i have made a hobby out of checking out their plans and what theyre buying online i have been kicked out of restrooms countless times for peering into the cracks in the bathroom stallsall in all though this film is pretty spectacular its great for adults kids and anyone who believes that their loved ones are secretly out to get themthanks i hope you enjoy itsincerely fellow imdb user blakelogsdon1,black_comedy
as you get older and try to find your way in life youd be forgiven for thinking someone is watching what youre doing especially with the abundance of cctv nowadaysthats what inevitably happens in the life of truman burbank jim carrey unfortunately hes not gazed upon for reasons of security as he is unaware his life is actually a 247 hour show for the rest of the world from womb to tomb his actions have kept millions enthralled but a few broken set pieces and a lost love may finally pull the blanket over trumans eyesthis is probably jim carrey at his most mature so far hes a performer who has such a wonderful bounce in his step that makes him devilishly cartoony in everything hes ever done both comedic and serious ed harris is fantastic as the show runner and for as serious as the film gets emotionally i dont think it ever underwhelms or overwhelms eitherregardless you sympathise with truman because his life has been manipulated so well but maybe that was another subtle point the movie was making that someones misery is abused for ratings despite differences from right and wrong saying that i dont really think id ever question my existence to the extent of trumans and i really admire this quotation from director peter wier this was a dangerous film to make because it couldnt happen how ironic final verdict an american classic and a unique film that begs multiple viewings 910,black_comedy
is a movie about a reality show and a world that is obsessed with watching itthis film addresses the voyeuristic quality in human beings in the film the main character of truman lives his life unaware that his entire is being played out before the world as it turns out the world is captivated by him in the year 2014 are a dime a dozen but back in 1998 the dawn of reality television was just beginning truman was before kim kardashian paris hilton and countless others who lived their lives on televisionjim carrey is so good in this role in many ways he is ideally cast a man who could not appear to be more ordinary on the outside but is so much bigger than the mundane world he is trapped in carreys portrayal of truman who knows something is not right but cant figure it out is both realistic and at times appropriately over the top hystericalthe director is also what makes this film work peter weir created this artificial world that looks seemingly normal and perfect there are times where you as the viewer even forget that trumans world is not real and actually looks like a nice place to live but the truth eventually wins out as it catches up with truman and even the best of shows eventually go off of the air,black_comedy
i heard someone say recently that in the 90s we have made celebrity out of people who have done basically nothing this would certainly apply to truman burbank jim carrey a man who doesnt know that every moment of his life has been manufactured and manipulated from birth to be a television seriestruman lives in the town of seahaven a plastic looking community he doesnt see it that way because he doesnt know anything else with white picket fences and friendly neighbors always ready with a friendly howdy but one day he starts to get a little suspicious truman though happily married still longs for a girl whom he had a crush on in college she was the only person who had sympathy for him so he hatches a plan to go to fiji to find her i loved the clever way that the television staff keeps coming up with ways to keep him in town using everything from delayed buses to his fear of the water to a nuclear reactor leakandrew niccols script reminds me of his previous work on gattaca another movie about a man whose life has been manufactured from birth watching the film i thought a lot of the life of princess diana from the day she started dating charles our voyeurism and our love for peering into the lives of our neighbors are central in this storywe are made to feel bad for truman but we are curious about how he is going to get away we become as voyeuristic as the audience in the movie does therefore our voyeurism is called into question our curiosity is aimed at making celebrity of a man who has done basically nothing,black_comedy
is a fantastic film it is about a man whose entire life is a tv show he has been monitored and been on since the day he was born all the way to his mid thirties although he is not aware of this fact all the people around him his family his relatives neighbors and friends are all actors hired by the tv show also to monitor himthe film starts out pretty basic and simple you wouldnt think anything extraordinary is happening you will just be seeing an average man going about his daily routine things keep on going pretty basic until an unforeseen event unfolds in his life and he becomes confused about what is going on some of trumans actions do not make sense early on as well tearing the pictures of girls from magazines soon after some events truman finds out something is wrong and there are people following him and monitoring his moments and soon after the twist is revealed in its full form that truman is in a tv show only he is not aware of it and everyone he knows in that town is a hired actor and the city he lives in is also a film setthis was a wonderful plot twist which not only makes the film so much more interesting and makes you want to rewatch the whole film again from a different perspective and closely watch the early scenes and listen to the dialog carefully and see how the actors are behaving around truman the ending was also great because it leaves it up to interpretation if truman will be able to survive in the world out there when he has spent his entire life on the film set the ending is not something i would call a happy ending because it leaves it up to interpretation about trumans future performance wise this film is great anyone who says jim carrey cannot do drama roles should watch this he plays truman at his very best although he does bring humor to some of his scenes he is mostly playing a dramatic character and his antics dialog delivery is all done well ed harris did not get that much screen time but he played christof spot on he was perfect in playing a man who would go as far as he can to make his tv show a success and make sure truman never leaves the rest of the actors on did well they were all playing two roles one of the actors in a tv shows and their characters in the tv show and it was well executed the direction is also fantastic there are camera which focus closely on truman with the screen having a background which is the films way of showing that truman is on camera and is being watched by people around the world the other camera angle is the one we see from out perspective the setting is also done well the whole island has been designed well to look like a tv setthe music is also good as it suits most of the scenes the film is in the music that plays in the intro and the conclusion when truman is talking to christof specially suits those scenes perfectly the only minor issue with truman show would be its slow pacing and slow start and slow development at least during your first watch by the time the major event start to unfold and the film starts to get interesting and reveal the big twists you may be kind of bored and may have grown restless you may want to watch it a second time from a different perspective knowing clearly from the start that truman is being directed the entire time but the slow scenes may still put you off regardless truman show is a fantastic ambitious indepth and thought provoking film about social satire which makes you think deeply the films storyline music and performances are all well done and the fact that its twist makes you watch it from a different perspective completely also makes this film that much better overall rating 910,black_comedy
while the story plot may seem weird to some this movie is simply marvelous jim carrey brilliantly plays a simple everyday guy who has a plain job and a plain wife in a plain house in a plain town all seems normal as ever until truman has an epiphany when strange things start to become more noticeable he begins to realize that his whole life has been recorded and podcasted as a worldwide hit tv show nothing is real anymore and truman must confront his every fear to learn the truth its a mindboggling tail that sort of makes you wonder if your life is a tv show and people are watching your every movement jim carrey not only proves he can outgrow his comedic roots at any moment but that hes an open book that could even be harnessed to head to oscar road emotional and heartwarming while also sad and mysterious this film is a classic,black_comedy
unpretentious satire on the most pretentious of media conceits that being the reality show that so many undiscerning viewers think is spontaneous an absurdity as great as believing that a big mac is actually nutritious and legitimate food but so many buy into those shows and buy the burger that peeling away the facade is a rather hopeless but noble endeavortries with its tv and religious allegories and it is also magnificent movie making jim carrey breaks out of his clown persona here and has become a respectable dramatic actor director peter weir delivers one of the best movies of the 1990s and arguably one of the best movies of all time it broke new ground while exploring ancient belief systems and modern medias hold on a population of sheep that orwell and others warned about this is enlightening and entertaining movie making at its best this could be double billed with the likeminded pleasantville 1998 but only if audiences were advised that the experience just might blow their bean and change their world viewis truly one of the great movies,black_comedy
i watched this film the first time it came out motivated by one reason i am a jim carey fan and had read no reviews whatsoever the first time you see the movie you know something isnt right and it is really intriguing and mysterious as you go on a journey as a viewer to unravel the truth how come the imdb plot and storyline give this to the viewer and actually declare that he is already in a tv show it is so much more enjoyable to watch this not knowing anything and discovering it for the first time as i really like the film i have watched it more than once but the first time being clueless about the tv show made the film highly memorable and much more entertaining too much is revealed in the indb description of the film let the audience have a chance to work it out or at least suspect,black_comedy
this name is going to be historic forever just because it is an attempt completely different out of the box unique the moment you watch it one is made to think can such ideas be really crafted in a motion picture the director peter weir and writer andrew niccol must be specially praised for such a worknow dont overlook jim carry he is a master man as always with ed harris intense performance this movie may also remind one about the story of a frog in a well who thinks that the well is everything the whole world not like that but being a comedy it shows what might happen with such a life entrapped yet unaware of anything at the same time we see the desire of freedom and lusty minds who seeks entertainment it questions as to what do we prefer humanity or false entertainment at any cost for momentary escape from reality in our lifethe film is certainly not preachy but makes one to think about various cobwebs that are and that may entrap us time to time the thing that lacked in the movie are as i felt editing and cinematography it was typical and simple some special things should have been done to provide complete impact to the viewer but i wonder if that would make the move more artificial but still it could have been better in the part of sets and camera,black_comedy
can you just imagine that your life being a big world hike reality show this is a huge and long running reality show may be even longer than daily serial soaps your birth first step first day in school everything is captured and showed to the world but without your knowledge and you are a global phenomena a star what happens when you come to know the huge and bitter truth of this  yes this is the plot of the movie truman show everyone knows jimmy carry is an awesome actor who performed brilliantly in many flicks like yes man bruce almighty liar liar and many more any how this movie is quite different from all those movies because this cinema had been built with a strong and perfect concept and script movie never makes you to take break in between it holds you till the end the small love story that appears between truman and sylvia is very touchy and finely portrayed actually each and every one in this movie were able to be praised for their magnificent performance a must watch social science fiction,black_comedy
wow what a movie i love this movie today even more than i did the first time it hasnt lost anything as time has passedi recall watching hitchcocks vertigo with a movie audience several years ago and when jimmy stewart explains to kim novak how he wants her to dress and wear her hair he ends with this justification it cant possibly matter to you the entire audience burst out laughingthis movie is as fresh and modern as it was in 1999 not as old as vertigo i know i love the reactions of those watching the show  how invested they are and how much they all love truman and jim carey is wonderful ed harris too as christoph a reference to christo perhaps there is a line about an umbrella picked up in a windstorm injuring someone is brilliant too,black_comedy
rating810that is as light as it is thought provoking with a fake smile and a world built around him truman is a true film hero and although maybe he doesnt do much we still feel oh so much for this character with the right mix of comedy and drama to go down with it too shows us what a show is all about and in a true sense shows us how obsessed the ordinary person is with certain peoples lives i felt the film was safely a great movie and here below is why i felt that about it allthe story is superbly smartly done and whoever even thought if this idea is just awesome it brings us all the elements we want to see from a film like this too and certain moments when truman is finally seeing what the world is all about are just fantastic the film isnt scared to be fun either as the story although is serious the things we see in it sometimes arent and we can get a few laughs out of this but as i said before it incorporates the right amount of drama into its plot too one minor thing is that the for its running time of 103 minutes it manages to fit such a complex plot into such a short amount of time just brilliant in my opinionjim carrey portrays truman in the way we always expect from carrey loud and very crazy although this isnt like all his roles as carrey has to deal with the drama too and manages not to always be trying to be funny a good job from him ed harris as the tv network head is kind of a strange mix of evil and goodness where as he wants the show to continue you can also tell it slightly eats him up that truman is shown to people like this the entire cast do an excellent job and even the odd policeman or shoe owner seems to do there performance with a hop and a smile just good fun had by allpeter weir does a fun job and really makes this his prime artistic vision that is brought to life perfectly this is probably his best piece of work in my opinion andrew niccol the writer also chips in with his artistic vision in writing to create dialogue that just keeps are eyes on the screen to see what this insane thing is all about i loved the sets used and not to ruin some cool things which you will see for yourself but some things are positioned in some pretty neat places tooalthough the film is great it isnt without maybe minor things which stop it from being superb like for example i didnt find this that funny and although it fun and bouncy when trying to be funny you wont be crying with laughter at this i also felt the ending was poor and although it makes for an interesting end and one you definitely wouldnt expect we dont get to explore much of it and just ends right there right then it isnt perfect but it is has very little problems so if you ignore them things this could be one of the best films you will ever seefor those who love jim carrey well this is probably one of if not his best work in film and although as i said he holds back on humour slightly he still manages a fantastic performance as truman which mixes a lot of elements together i think if you ever wanted a thought provoking film then this is it i dont think it make you think philosophically but it makes you think about human nature and lying etc what the world really thinks of other people and how we talk about each otheroverall will give it a 810 safely a great movie i couldnt recommend this much more to you and especially to those who consider themselves as film connoisseurs as i feel this could be essential viewing have fun with this movie and it will reward you come in thinking of it as super serious and you will be disappointed i can assure you that watching this can give you a little smile and although sometimes you might feel like shouting get out of there truman you still just feel happy for him the entire way through,black_comedy
when this came out it was unique id never seen anything like it it was basically a film and filming a tv show it sounded weird and almost scifi but it was none of those things it was actually a really good movie jim carrey is perfect in this it gives him the chance to really shine as an actor combining the comedic and the dramatic to get an extremely likable character its his best role in my opinion and honestly he is the reason to see this film because i dont think it would be as interesting with another actor i really liked the soundtrack to this film as well it was very moving at times the rest of the cast also did a fantastic job the utopian scenery blends in perfectly into this film and makes it all the more interesting its a great and different type of film that should be seen by all it never strays too much in the goofiness arena and is always endearing and believablegreat idea and very good movie,black_comedy
this must be one of the greatest movies ever i have seen this movie a lot of times and its as good as first time i watched it every time the best movie that jim carrey have ever starred in he is a very good actor but this is probably one of the movies he is best in i can definitely recommend this movie for everyone if you like jim carrey and have seen some of his other movies and havent seen this one you should go see it right after you read this review theres not a single moment in this movie thats boring if you ask me the soundtrack for this movie is also really great the truman sleeps song is so beautiful,black_comedy
directed by peter weir is truly an excellent film that explores new ways to engage the viewer in its own way it truly catches ones attention as it is one of those rare films that are simple yet very deep it focuses on truman burbank a man whose life is nothing but a routine truman then realizes that everything in his life has been the same and the story begins to unravel from therepeter weir is a great director he was able to fool the viewer in making us believe that truman is living in a normal world and not a tv show he was very successful in making the story evolve around truman and make us feel the tension between the characters his camera angles were great as he sometimes uses the hidden cameras that were used in the show i felt that was very creativeis written by andrew niccol who also wrote and directed the very successful gattaca he does a great job writing the film as he made the viewer know only what truman knows and did not have any dramatic irony which i really loved this helped the story to focus on truman and develop around him which made the film much more entertaining i have to admit when i watched the first 30 minutes of the film i was lost i didnt understand anything but once truman finds out that his life is fake the viewer finds out with him and suddenly i understood everything the character development is one of the best thing in as truman develops into something totally different than what he was in the beginning of this excellent filmthe acting is of coarse amazing as jim carrey does his best ever acting in this film seeing him happy sad angry and dramatic carrey truly proved himself to be an excellent actoroverall is an excellent and unique film it is a must see,black_comedy
is a movie that is simply brilliant the more i think about this movie the more i seem to see in it its ending left me totally stunned and the entire movie is pure originality and it is made in a way that you are not sure of how it is going to endis a television program that is focused around one man truman burbank jim carey he has no idea that he is the star of a television program and he simply goes about life as if it was his life the show goes for twenty four hours a day seven days a week with no breaks advertising is made a part of the show and is blatant to the audience but truman simply does not think there is that much strange about it the show takes place inside a huge dome called the hollywood dome that surrounds a beautiful beach town at one time truman has wanted to leave the town but they have always found ways to keep him inside they decided that the best way was to give him a phobia about water as the town has been built on an island so they killed his father while on a boating tripthe movie is about control they say so at the beginning though truman is not supposed to know that he is living in a television show they try to make sure that every aspect of his life is controlled the first realization of this is when he catches the eye of one woman and he decides that he wants to get to know her better but christof ed harris the director prevents this by sending another woman to him that he is going to marry once that happens his next goal is for truman it impregnate his wife but the problem is that he does not love her and because he does not love her he has no desire to have children with her he is still very much in love with the woman who he glimpsed for a secondanother way they control truman to keep him in the town is through subtle things like a job friends and a mortgage he wants dearly to go to fiji because he believes the woman he loves is there but he cant go he has a mortgage on the house and the car making money tight when he does try to go more problems begin like the bus breaking down a forest fire and finally a nuclear meltdown in this movie there is no coincidence and you realize this when everything seems to happen to push truman in a particular way it seems that it is real life but we see through the faade when we know that everything in trumans world is controlledit is interesting though to consider whether this is reflected onto our world seems to be a cry out for freedom and individuality in one aspect it could be a movie of rebellion against god screaming that god has no right to control our lives and that we should be able to do what we want another aspect is that it is an attack against the government which i think is more so the government seeks to control peoples lives but there is a cry that the government limit itself and give us our freedom to do what we want in a way seems to be like 1984 where big brother knows everything about usas for rebelling against gods control we must remember that god has given us a free choice of turning away from him truman has no choice whether he wants to stay or go no matter how hard truman tries to leave christof refuses to let him go god does control the universe and he does everything for our own good christof claims the same for truman but truman has no choice we do truman does not know the truth we do truman believes everything in the dome is real where it is not god has revealed himself and his plan to us in the bible and thus we are able to make a choice based on thatanother aspect is privacy in there is none truman does not have a private life even though he thinks he does every action everything that he does is watched by millions of people world wide his funny things in the bathroom are a private matter to him but people watch him and laugh at his anticsit is also interesting to note that truman has no friends everybody around him is there because they are being paid to be there his best friend never says anything from his heart but from the mouth of christof his wife does not love him and does not even consider their marriage legitimate because she crossed her fingers when she made the vows as such the life of truman becomes a sad lonely and false life though he believes that he has friends he does not and if all were to go away he would in the end be left with nobodyis simply one awesome movie it is one that i would put up in the region of the classics it stands alone with its plot and its story and it takes on board some very deep themes,black_comedy
peter weir directed this comedydrama that stars jim carrey as truman burbank a seemingly ordinary and happily married man who lives in a nice town with a nice job and friends but grows increasingly suspicious that something is off and it turns out hes right as truman is unknowingly the star of the worlds biggest reality tv show where everything has been scripted since he was a baby even his family once aware of this truman tries to find a way out while the shows creator and director christofplayed by ed harris tries to keep a lid on the situation existentialist film works reasonably well though this idea had been explored before on the twilight zone still this is an interesting and thoughtprovoking film regardless,black_comedy
how did i miss this i watched almost all of his movies in my childhood but most of them were those funny ones well my parents might have felt that i was a little young to understand thisits almost one year since i watched this one i had this de javu feeling when i was watching truman show the plot felt familiar which traces back to my childhood when i had similar instinctsi dont want to reveal any spoilers here jim carrey was exceptional in the role of truman he portrayed his emotions exceptionally and i felt too attached with the character the writing cant get better than thisthe direction was good,black_comedy
how would you ever convince yourself youre living in an artificial world when literally everyone else even your significant other and childhood friends are fooling you its a terrifying thought to think you are constantly being monitored and purposely manipulated without cognizance truman burbank jim carrey is just an average person well not really being watched by the entire world since his birth unaware of the world that exists outside of seahaven its sad to consider a man with such genuine and adventurous dreams being limited in his life because of money having your life televised is one thing but doing it without informed consent and only deceit and trickery is the primary reason this film strikes chords with people its a generally accepted view that beings should have the right to do with their lives as they wish this fundamental freedom is taken away from an innocent person whose only mishap was being born to parents that didnt want himgrowing up in modern society it is well known that we tend to take things for granted whether youre living in a closed dome or restricted by the government freedom to choose is one of the most innate yet exploited aspects of society its an unnerving thought but maybe we are all living in a closed environment playing the pawns we just dont realize it,black_comedy
i have heard of to be regarded as a reference point movie where the general outline of the story is so outrageous and unique to a point that everyone knows the film through the phrase oh thats the one where the guy is trapped in so and so not every film is as instantly recognizable as the matrix or star wars but their setups are crucial to the intrigue as with groundhog day may just be one of the greatest and most intelligent comedies of the 1990ssome may find the satire here too heavy handed thus making it shallow but the pertinent themes of selfdetermination the relationship of institutions like the state media and religion in tandem with the idea of free will and the concept of what it truly means to be a happy person are all explored for better or worse here some of the imagery is a little too obvious like truman literally piercing through the edge of the world and having a conversation with god the natural source of comedy in truman slowly realizing his world is a tv set is woefully underused with only about a third of the screen time dedicated to jim carreys priceless antics among the straight faced actors and television crew around him the film remorselessly lampoons network television with views inside the control room a perfectly cast ed harris as a maniacal parody of a steve jobs entrepreneurartiste complete with beret and turtleneck sweater anchors the story as the plausibly divine instrument of trumans fate the use of product placement invading the characters life is another stroke of geniusthe film ends somewhat abruptly but the tale of a single human life being born out of and fighting against the ratings is something to aspire to ironically the metaphor couldnt be more appropriate in this day and age of increasing surveillance and invasion of privacy apart from that this is certainly the best jim carrey film after eternal sunshine of the spotless mind,black_comedy
isnt your average jim carrey film as it doesnt show carrey using his usual schtick as he does in other movies and those are the jim carrey films that i love to see because when you take away his comedic appeal you can get a very dramatic and emotional actor carrey plays a man who is unaware that his entire life is a television show he has been on the show ever since he was an infant despite having kept this a secret for 30 years truman soon begins to suspect something different about his perfect life despite the shows clever and hilarious lengths to keep him uninterested in the world outside of him where does truman want to go well in a very interesting subplot we learn that truman wants to visit fiji why because the girl of his dreams previously an extra on the show now an activist living in the real world with an ambition to free truman with the help of political activism was taken away by her supposed father who hastily replied that they were going to fiji now truman wants to go to fiji to reunite with the love of his life and escape his blond and boring wife if theres one thing that holds this film together its the acting not just from carrey but from the supporting cast which has an exceptionally difficult job of being a good actor when portraying a good actor and they pull it off flawlessly one ofs themes is feeding into ones anxieties it carries this off by having truman live in a world where travel is frowned upon and made to seem to dangerous and too expensive theres a really funny and well done scene where truman goes mad and attempts to drive to anywhere in america and the show tried to retail irate by presenting truman with controlled dilemmas like traffic forest fires and chemical leaks it makes me happy that i didnt see it when i was younger because it surely would upset me but even still truman still attempts to escape giving the character a sense of courage and thats what makes work the character is great the character is relatable he represents a great film character and what great film character would be complete without a great film check it out,black_comedy
a few years ago my mum bought me for my birthday and told me id really like it it was the first proper adult movie id ever seen being only about nine and i was a bit skeptical but the story line intrigued me so i gave it a go and loved it trumans character is truly suited to carreys acting style a seemingly effortless portrayal is pulled off which gets the audience laughing and crying along with him a must see movie for anyone of any age peter weir made it the perfect balance of funny disturbing heartbreaking and hopeful and carreys portrayal of burbank is phenomenal the concept was one that had not been explored very much before the movie came out and is one that has intrigued people and made us all wonder about our very existence with other tv shows and movies adopting a similar concept and doing well a great family movie i possess the great directors collection edition which really goes to show how much weir is admired for his direction of the movie and how it will be watched and remembered for many years to come by the old and the young alike,black_comedy
hello readers today you will read my review on jim carreys best film the first time i viewed the film was in 2001 when i was at a friends house before my viewing i never thought much of the film but as soon as the first 5 minutes passed i was entranced its just such an enjoyable and funfilled film ed harris was one of the reasons i really liked the film and jim carrey who can prove to be a brilliant actor when he tries i am a fan of jim carrey films especially the funny ones when i first saw the trailer of this film it looked like a more serious jim carrey film but i was dead wrong and thus concludes my review on one of my most adored films so long now or in case i dont see ya good after noon good evening and good night,black_comedy
was a movie that shows truman burbanks life as a reality tv show without his knowledge since his birth jim carrey was truman burbank and his wife meryl burbank played by laura linney trumans best friend marlon was noah emmerich christof the creator of the tv show was ed harris jim carrey was able to mix his silly comedy with thoughtful drama and the script provided new experience on drama moviesfighting for freedom thinking of ways to run away believing in his feelings jim carrey performance was amazing after having the curiosity that something is wrong he tried many times to discover the way to run away but most of the time he fails trumans courage increased in every scene in the movie christof was trying to keep truman under control by directing the actors to what to do next until he decided that he was ready to die to get his freedom truman said is that the best you can do you gonna have to kill me also every other actor in the movie tried to stop him from his wife best friend and secondary actors meryl tried to break him down every time he was thinking to travel by reminding him of their financial responsibility i think you should save for a few months and then go she said she was laughing again his friend tried to convince him that their city is the best place in the world by touching trumans feelings by his words look at that sun set truman it is perfect every actor did a great job in this movie by involving their emotion in their acting and that helped to make the audience connect emotionally with the moviethe romance the drama and the action in the movie had become from the script the script helped the actors to have many ways to express their feelings by the words they were saying or by the action they were doing marlon said he is goon cut transmission frustratedchristof react additionally it rearranged the idea of the drama movies by adding a little romance action and comedy to the drama to make the movie suitable to all tastes fighting against the stormlooking to the picture of his love looking to the bright sun jim carrey was successful in mixing all these feeling in one scene directed by peter weir written by andrew niccol starring by jim carrey was a great movie to watch it had a new experience that made it different from the rest of the drama movies skilled actors and a precise script made it one of the best movies that involve the audience emotionally and make them react with every scene truman was trapped in his life and there were people controlling his live that left viewers thinking if they trapped in their lives or there is someone controlling their lives,black_comedy
far from being a masterpiece this film has something special to offer to the viewers its really enjoyable fun and smart besides subtly criticizing the media and its ways of manipulation this film was a true lesson to me it made me think about the importance of living knowing and discovering some of us fear change and cant easily get out of their comfort zone i think its a big deal to have the courage to leave your home that place that made you who you are to face the world and get to know yourself better the human mind is a very complex toy but also fragile sometimes we prefer living a lie because it gives us sort of a sense of security sometimes we reject new experiences just because they arenew sometimes we like to live in our own little universe for fear of the others this film has many morals and its up to each of us to discover one for me the moral was its never too late to escape from the perfect little world youve created or the others have created for you and start to live for real,black_comedy
amazing movie but guys your movie description ruined the entire twist of the movie an insurance salesmanadjuster discovers his entire life is actually a tv showi knew from start what was happening thanks quoted from otherwhen i first saw i came out of the theatre amazed this is your first clue that you are watching something different from your normal jim carrey movie i love the dialogue camera shot performances direction music and running time of this movie there is nothing i would do to change it i came away from feeling inspired which is the goal of good filmmaking jim carrey was outstanding as truman underplaying him not making him too comic or too dramatic but giving true sincerity when asked he deserved an oscar nomination ed harris has always been a good actor but in this movie hes a great actor he plays christof with such arrogance and bullheadedness that you dont know whether hes helping or destroying truman he and the director peter weir deserved their oscar nods,black_comedy
this is my 12th movie review on imdb first thing to say is that the entire movie plot  i have never seen heard a movie this original before i have seen jim carrey in a some other movies like bruce almighty  ace ventura and other films were he is funny however for this film funny does not describe it enough  this movie is funny  real  fun  charming  has heart  intriguing  juicy  touching  has a lot of soul in it  witty  clever and very unique in many ways well first before i talk about the movie i would like to say that peter weir seems to be a great director  although i have not seen his movie witness that stars harrison ford that people seem to mention the most on here  i have seen dead poets society and fearless that i would say are underrated masterpieces  i should review those movies on here soon   and this film belongs in the masterpiece category as well it would only make logical sense for me to put  witness  on my netflix list to watch eventually so let me talk about this movie a little bit here truman burbank is a star of a 24 hour tv show that he has no idea about when he starts to realizes something is wrong in his life his goal  to be free  he has to  break out of the cage  but who gets in the way ignorant  stubborn  arrogant christof who as well was brilliantly played the actor whose name is ed harris he is the villain of the movieoutstanding  this movie is 100  creative  great actors and jim carrey is real innocent emotional human ed harris did a great job  theres a beautiful flow start to end with a wonderful ending of truman  sound track is amazing  camera shots were greatly unique  lines  the movie had a bunch of great  comical one lines that i need to remember and script gets an a  its rare for a movie to get 10 out 10 however this one deserves it ,black_comedy
peter weir has casted wellknown comedians into serious roles before with robin williams starring in dead poets society we had to study this film in english and i actually got quite excited this is an astounding movie and is done so well jim carrey plays the main character truman burbank trueman truman lives what he thinks is a normal life he has a wife a home a friend hes known for most of his life and a deskjob at an insurance agency what he doesnt realize is that he is actually a star in a 24 hour live show which is showed all across the globe which documents like a soapopera his lifethe whole film tackles the themes of the power of the media and even religious themes about the god if you look hard enough as truman starts to realize that his life is different from everyone around him the script is more than perfect the dialogue is wonderful and there is an excellent mix of heartwarming stuff as well as some comedy to lighten the mood a necessity the film is not too long which is a good thing because a considerable length for a movie like this could ruin it the acting is another standout alongside the excellent script jim carrey does a great job and i can see how they casted him instead of another normal actor yes jim youre not a normal actor all the actors do a good job but keep an eye out for the man who plays trumans friend marlon who does amazing and a few scenes you would see why theres nothing more i can really say about this film its thoughtprovoking its wonderfully scripted and acted it has a few funny scenes to lighten the mood but overall its serious i must say that it is not a popcorn film but it is also a film which is worth more than one viewing watch it twice in a week and you will understand a bit more of the themes and nuances which help create this world this is the type of movie which really leaves an impression on you after you watch it i promise you this movie is not forgettable and you will be left thinking about it hours after the credits appear,black_comedy
we all are stuck at those unknown levels which are mysterious and still we are living those levels with all the emotions right from childhood to old age this movie is one philosophical and thought provoking movie and mr jim is a real gem of hollywood  how in this world he did not won oscar for this performance right from start to finish this movie keep you spellbounded and somehow it also reflects light upon selfrealization  still its a complete entertainer and thats the beauty of in our holy scripture mahabharata written by great sage mr ved vyas it is already written that this world is a biggest stage created by almighty and we all are just elements of his private show and we come and go to and from him according to our conducted deeds likewise everyone is actually living and we always need courage to come out of our own cocoon of misconceptions because whatever we are doing just like mr truman we already know in our heart about its correctness and viceverse i truly believe this movie is a must watch for every living being who call himselfherself resident of a planet named as  earth,black_comedy
imagine a world where you and guarded 24 hours unknowingly imagine a lifetime of being seen by the whole world without having ever gone out of your small space chronicles the life of truman who thought he lived a normal with a perfect family living in an ordinary town with neighbors postmen and a friendly dog that makes parter scenario where everything is in its place  truman show a film made in 1998 but still continues today truman puts us in a society where everything is just a big show where reality fits all within a script with middle and end making us reflect what actually true and what is simply staging ,black_comedy
there are many entertaining films fewer are great ones even fewer are ones that are memorable and push the limit in terms of inventive creativity and pure originality is such a tour de force it is a film that is hard to describe it is not quite a comedy though it is funny neither is it a drama though there are dramatic elements to it can be a genre of its own fantasy sciencefiction comedy drama adventure thrillerall fit into this movie it is that unique as a feeble attempt to explain the plot this movie is about a man who lives a seemingly ordinary middleclass life in suburbia who happens to be filmed from every angle imaginable the catch he does not know about it as bizarre factors begin to take place he starts to question his identity and life around him like the millions of viewers who turn in to see mr truman we too are fascinated as to what he does next and how it will end jim carrey as truman turns in perhaps his greatest performance although eternal sunshine of the spotless mind was pretty good too his trademark humor is left out and he becomes this individual trapped in a world that is beyond his control the supporting cast is very solid particularly ed harris as christoph the man behind the curtain so to speak however it is carrey who steals the show i mean it is about him after all besides the acting peter weirs direction is sublime the visual effects are impressive the editing is wellpaced and the score is simply astounding if i had to make one criticism about the movie that is its abrupt ending that aside i consider to be one of the most creative films ever made and one of my favorites way better than saving private ryan and shakespeare in love,black_comedy
the first 20 minutes are boring and those consume the 9 of my rating aggregate the remaining 80 minutes are epicstarting off like any other drama film talks about the story of an ordinary man but as the plot advances and as the character grows up psychologically things seem to take a reality check throughout the realization  final mission you stick to your seat most of your senses concentrating on what might happen next twists  turns start to come up and you stay mesmerizedjim carrey has won the oscar at least for me his slapstick is improbable but funny his portrayal is full of originality supporting cast act very well music symphonies provide a strong score and the screenplay just completes the classici can watch this more and more and still stay baffled at the unwinding of plot a huge 9110bottom line a wonderful experience highly recommendedcan be watched with a typical indian family yesprofanity no  sexnudityvulgarity no  mouthkiss very mild  smoking no  violence mild  gore no  drugs no  alcohol strong,black_comedy
one of the few hollywood produced films that will stand the test of time as art  high art  im talkin ugetsu ikiru seventh seal  the rarefied air  the ive been to the mountaintop of cinematic artnow  what happened with the public reception many of our nations best critics realized to one extent or another how great the film was  perhaps not as much its prophetic nature  which if you saw it originally in the theater  you might try viewing it again  to seethe featured review is on the right track 1998 was a bumper crop year for hollywood film  yet few in hollywood seemed to realize it true carrys goofy reputation if somewhat deserved caused many to miss the point  but at the end of the day all of the latent denial in the american psyche  specifically catered to by the hollywood elite  produced the most blatant oscar night debacle in a long history of this tragically repeated motif  great art once again denied the laurel wreath in deference to crass commercialism  in this case two of the greatest english language films ever made and american history x shunted in favor of a shameless piece of fluff based on dubious if not downright dishonest premises joseph fiennes vaunted backside and the rather gauchely revolting nepotistic spectacle of gwynnie dancing with daddytruly the american public really did not get  it got by most of us  perhaps it requires repeated viewings  such an incisive critique of the american psyche as it is  where even the most sacred things are trampled under our incessant selfcreated need for security and the lies were willing to tell ourselves to perpetuate it the final conversation between truman and his lifelong friend marlin is imo one of the greatest scenes ever filmed  revealing the depth of the corruption of our wayward civilization  enough to make dostoyevskys grand inquisitor blush with shameweir has made a number of very good films dead poets society last wave witness butthis is his materpiece a film one should see again and again not merely vg  great,black_comedy
the film is part satire part comedy the recent shows like big brother etc work on similar concept this movie takes it a step further it creates a whole fake city a whole alternative controlled life though over the top it makes you stop and wonder what ifthe movie is about truman burbank jim carrey whose whole life is a television show and he is unaware of it it is about his journey from ignorance to slow perception the film plot though in modern times is not very new with the recent onslaught of reality tv but it does have its moments of clarity jim carrey has once again proved that not just outrageous comedy or dark thriller roles are his forte but a serious mix of the two is also up his alley he has managed to hook the audience you find yourself rooting for him for the escape at the same time hoping to catch more of his drama ed harris christof as the creator of the show is again brilliant through fewer words he emotes more his attachment to truman as the father figure as the creator is almost tangible though jim carries the movie through seeing as he is in every shot he got good support from laura linneynoah emmerich actors they have managed to capture a fine line between scripted characters and real peopleoverall it is a simple unassuming film which is thought provoking on many levels but still remains a thorough entertainment,black_comedy
the ingenuity of lies in so far as it can be interpreted in a variety of discourses and on so many levels the discussions about the prescience of realitytv and the satire of the american dream notwithstanding to me this film is a theological dialogue regarding the existence of humanityandrew niccol writes a mindaltering script which is seemingly inspired by the writings of philipkdick the great visionary and writer who threw mankind a simple yet grave question  what is real it is indeed a query raised in varying degrees in bible too if you think philosophy also these are the questions man has been asking himself since eternity  who exactly am i what is the point of me being here so trumans journey through the sea to the real world almost becomes mankinds journey to its maker or to the ultimate truth of existencewhen truman finds the door out of the simulated world christoffs voice speaks to him in an almost celestial manner as like an oracle  i am your creator here is an existential undertone christoff telling truman that he has watched him all his life resounds estragon in waiting for godot when he says does god watch over me as i stand wait live what truman wants to say to his god is dont watch over me at all it is almost an antithesis to estragons plea christoff then asks truman to return to his old world that this new world is no more a true world than the world he has known truman is in a dialectic predicamentbrilliantly portrayed by jim carrey his situation here almost parallels kierkegaards paradoxical and ambiguityladen view of human life he has to make a choice to return to the familiar world or to proceed to the real world this sequence reinforces the notion of free choice and rejects predestination truman makes his choice and is free to move close to reality or simply to what is trueis a work of genius it is an endeavour at the quest for the reasons of our being it is almost an ontological conversation mankind would want to have with its creator,black_comedy
have you ever had the feeling that your entire life is actually just a reality television show and that your every waking moment has been predetermined well for insurance salesman truman burbank thats exactly what has happened he is unknowingly the star of the worlds top reality show all his family friends work colleagues neighbours and everyone else he meets on the island of seahaven are actually actors bored with his life and desperate to travel he begins to notice that something isnt rightjim carrey is excellent as truman proving that as with the number 23 2007 eternal sunshine of the spotless mind 2004 and man on the moon 1999 he doesnt need to rely on silly faces and slapstick to give a great performance along with top supporting roles for ed harris as television producer christof and laura kinney as his wife this is an absolute must watch,black_comedy
this movie since my whole childhood touched me the most of all movies i have ever seen and it is still the case this is the consequence of the combination the absolutely true and brilliant emotionally composed acting of jim carrey the story simple but still intense which he perfectly fits in and the soundtrack with well selected authentic pieces especially those by philip glass that gives so many scenes an unforgettable character in its emotions the pain the helplessness covered in clownish behavior jim carreys performance reminds me very much of john lennons music from the early 60s a person who never stops feeling far too small and awkward for the big role he realizes to play but he plays it and people look up to him,black_comedy
today is 4313 ive already watched this film before and honestly speaking it is so damn great i love the movie perfectbut im confused what happened to him in the outside world what did he do to those people who put him into that imaginary world where is his parents what will happened to him and the woman he truly loved what would he feel in the outside world what would he feel to those people who just watched him vice versa and what would he do to the man who played godi wish there could be a sequel definitely gonna watch it,black_comedy
is jim carreys best movie handsdown not only do we see his usual comedic talent but we also see some surprising dramatic chops from him the first few minutes i had no idea what was going on in the movie but by the end i was amazed i never thought jim carrey would put on a performance as he displayed here inunlike most carrey movies this movie has an actual plot and a really original one at least it was back in 1998 this film is about a guy truman who is being filmed in part of a 24hour reality tv show but he just believes he is an ordinary guy living a normal life as time goes on he believes to suspect that not all is ordinaryas i mentioned before jim carrey is very very good but also deserving praise is ed harris as the shows creator he played his role so well i had to ask myself if he is the good guy or the bad guy and that usually never happensoverall this is a masterful film directed by peter weir both weir and harris are deserving of their oscar nods i truly wish that carrey received one as well the film holds up well as we move along in the 21st century the visual effects and the way the movie was filmed regarding the florida landscape was really done well my favorite scenes in the movie were when the wife was talking as if she was an advertiser but truman never notices i always found that funny this is a funny charming and moving film that shows carrey with a different side to himself i rate this film 910,black_comedy
like everyone else says its dead good jim carey shows that he can actually act ed harris shows that his acting is entering the superclass league the script is grand all the supporting actors give sterling performances youll laugh youll cry youll talk about it afterwards and yet i cant help feeling its not quite the fivestar smash that all the other reviewers say it is its derivative stepford wives its a wonderful life the town 1984 philip glass even though he didnt write the music it has plot holes the size of texas it has a happy ending that struck me as more likely to be the result of voting by brainless preview audiences than the authors intent but why carp its better than the average hollywood film for sure and well worth the admission pricei think its something to do with the things in which youve been immersed for a lifetime the average film critic falls over in amazement when she discovers something that is not european and not utterly brainless because she has been raised on a vapid soulless utterly boring diet of literature and film based around the emptiness of family drama where middleclass comment passes for politics and consideration of real intellectual ideas is anathema on the other hand the average spotty youth or youthess who has even glanced at the only true literature of the 20th century i mean science fiction of course or considered the history of philosophy even at the amoebic level of zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance will see and cry out yeah very pretty but tell us something newso my advice to you is see the film if an idea has ever crossed your brain you will probably enjoy it though be puzzled at what all the fuss is about if you are a film critic for the quality press youll think its the second coming,black_comedy

have you ever wondered what if my life is actually a film well for truman burbank that thought is a reality as the camera starts rolling and our 103 minute journey begins we meet truman burbank jim carrey a man who has been filmed since the day he was born he lives in a madeup world with a madeup family in a madeup town full of actors meryl trumans wife is an advertising perfect wife as far as the eye can see many other reviews that i have read of this film i do my research you see have praised laura linney meryl as a star actress while the part is played to perfection the fake demeanour is so obvious to viewers and so unclear to the gullible character of truman i however find meryls character the only blemish in this film i am not criticising linneys acting skills but the personality of her character i find the fake and false charade grates on me and i find myself wanting to slap the practisedinthemirror smile right off her face so while i can tell you the flaws of this film i can also tell you its highlights its a funny happy comedy in a sort of couldbeapantomime way i liked it i didnt love it but its a family film all the way through my criticisms are trumped vaguely by the staggering figure of 125 million boxoffice takings it started with a 60 million budget this film takes an unusual and unique approach to the family film market no princesses or castles and while you could say it has a happyeverafter ending the cliffhanger toned it down it may not be the best film it may not be the funniest but it was good kids will like it 3 out of 5 stars,black_comedy
have you ever you felt like someone is watching you alex charlton now is paranoid and is always looking for hidden cameras after watching  starring jim carrey plot the whole world is pretty much watching trumans every move but he doesnt realise his friends and family are actors as his life is made up truman tries to go on adventures but the under cover actors around him persuade him out of it in the end truman starts to be aware that its all lies review in my opinion the film is funny and entertaining the acting was believable and its a great story line at the beginning you have to pay more attention to understand whats going on and whats happened to truman ed harris who played christof was nominated for 3 oscars as best supporting actor best director and best writing screen play is a pg certificate and the genre is comedy and drama also it was first realised in october 1998 but still really popular and still good quality the budget of the film was 60 million and the box office takings were 125 million just from the cinema takings alone which is a great achievement and great fro the show it helped that the producers of this show was paramount pictures a very popular company and it was directed by the amazing peter weir if you love the big brother serious then youll definitely love this however you dont have to love it as i dont because i still enjoyed i give this film 4 stars out of 5 in chase i dont see ya good afternoon good evening and good night watch out is the whole world watching you,black_comedy
when was concealed as a script reality tv was something brand new and exciting a fresh thing which would shake the world of entertainment for a while before it grew old and went into tv history like everything else what the scriptwriters probably didnt know is that reality tv is going to last until the present days and sprout into uncountable degenerate alterations i guess was a form of social satire an orwellian vision of the future which will never come boy they were wrong watching truman burbank back in 1998 made me laugh though these days it very much resembles all other tv surroundingwhat does this mean for the movie its still brilliant a rare and shiny gem in the sludge of hollywood as well as jim carreys role of a lifetime the film is great but the fact our world is becoming more and more like is what scares me furthermore people these days crave to have their privacy invaded much unlike poor and oblivious mr burbankif truman knew back in 1998 what the world of reality tv would look like now in 2012 i guess he would have tied a rope around his neck and jumped off that boat into the storm,black_comedy
really mocks the way we perceive the world around us accepting the way it is and not asking why it is so it raises the question of a creator godand if he really controls the way we live as shown in the movie by character of ed harris the movie has its anxious moments where u really get absorbed in the story when i was watching this movie another movie came across my mind the adjustment bureau which has a similar premise both having a underlying sublime message of contest between the free will of oneself and the almighty godin the end is truly amazing movie,black_comedy
a mans entire life is a show put on by a rather selfish rich director the director builds an entire island set for truman to live on complete with a whole island of actors the film is based around truman breaking free of this fake life and realising he has been living a lie i thought it was a very unique and realistic film hugely enjoyable with just the right amount of funny and tense jim carrey does a surprisingly serious performance and ed harris does a unnervingly good performance too the abrupt ending gave added realism to the film because it coincides with the whole theme of life and how real or fake life and people really are overall a imaginative film pulled off rather surprisingly well,black_comedy
when i first saw i came out of the theatre amazed this is your first clue that you are watching something different from your normal jim carrey movie i love the dialogue camera shot performances direction music and running time of this movie there is nothing i would do to change it i came away from feeling inspired which is the goal of good filmmaking jim carrey was outstanding as truman underplaying him not making him too comic or too dramatic but giving true sincerity when asked he deserved an oscar nomination ed harris has always been a good actor but in this movie hes a great actor he plays christof with such arrogance and bullheadedness that you dont know whether hes helping or destroying truman he and the director peter weir deserved their oscar nodsweir who directed the great witness uses different camera angles to make you feel like youre actually watching and not a movie he ends it before you get tired of the concept and helped carrey and harris give immaculate performances andrew niccol script is a real star in the movie too because of its inventiveness and ingenuity overall is what i like to call a true american classic,black_comedy
well this film is much different from the most the story is very original and well thought but i dont think it was well executed the director doesnt seem to be capable to provoke any emotions in the spectator until the last 20 minutes which for a drama film is a shame the things happen too randomly and nonsense until around 70 minutes of running which made me very bored and lost in the story the soundtrack isnt touching neither deep so the film isnt comedy isnt drama isnt anything also this is a much improbable show since no decent country would have laws to allow it also tying yourself in the boat isnt very smart since the boat could turn upside down and youd drown to deathit is surely filled with philosophical thoughts and questions but they do not seem to fit in the film the only things that made me happy are the last minutes the originality and the cute old ladys couple lol i think is one of the famous called overrated movies a remake of this with a better director and cast would be reasonable and exciting at least for me,black_comedy
first of all i am not a good critic but an average movie fan so i many a time cant appreciate delicate subtle part of the movies this is the disclaimer in the beginninghaving said that i dont know how this movie got a good rating i watched this movie only for jim carreys sake there is not a great scope for his performance i felt this movie awfully boring i am sorry may be because of my high expectations from jim carrey i dont know but this movie failed to elicit interest in mebut the plot and the story lines are different so i can rate with the safe rating of 5,black_comedy
exceptionally genuine story with many underlying thoughtprovoking ideas on one level you can think of this story as an attack against an inhumane consumerist mediacontrolled society where everything is to be sold and benefited from even human lives on another level the story is nothing but an existential pondering on the mangod relationship truman represents the once helpless mindcontrolled man who gradually starts to break free by pushing the limits of his realitys already given axioms some may not like this saying it represents a breaking away from god represented by christof the show director but i think it just encourages man to think outside the box and pushes him to refuse whatever reality imposes upon him to simply unleash his imagination jim carrey did a great job but the one who really blew my mind away was ed harris with his extremely grand and mature performance i just couldnt take my eyes off him,black_comedy
jim carrey is primarily known for his silly characters and odd roles however truly shows how brilliant he can be truman burbank jim carrey has lived his entire life literally in a virtual reality his entire life is broadcast on television completely without his knowledge his wife friends coworkers everyone on the street are all actors his existence is essentially created by a producer named christof ed harris showing his own brilliance the theme of appearance versus reality is apparent throughout the entire movie truman believes his life to be real when it fact it is very controlled the townspeople are all linked by radio earpiece to the producers so that they may receive instructions to keep truman from discovering the truth about his world the smallest cameras ever made are utilized to capture trumans every move and the show even has its own satellite in order to broadcast 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year has been the most popular show on television for 30 years literally since truman was born eventually truman begins to suspect that something is amiss such as a stage light falling out of the sky an elevator without a back even an alleged nuclear power plant meltdown when he tries to escape town keeping him from leaving his suspicions become so strong that he eventually confronts his wife meryl laura linney with them and she accuses him of having a nervous breakdown at this point jim carrey shows his acting talent and transitions from comedy to drama the effect is profound and meryl drops character screaming that she cant work under these conditions and that it is unprofessional eventually truman realizes that his reality isnt real and escapes the town the camera angles in the movie were interesting many times using a fisheye lens to give a bugs eye view from a wall or from behind trumans medicine cabinet mirror the cameras are scattered through town trumans house workplace even worn by the actors christof even admits in an interview that we accept the reality of the world with which we are presented seems to be the predecessor of modern reality television its touted as reality but it is heavily controlled by producers and an onsite crew and at times is scripted popular mechanics listed as one of the 10 most prophetic scifi shows in 2008 director peter weir actually stated this was a dangerous film to make because it couldnt happen how ironic when predicting the rise of reality television certainly stands out among movies especially when compared to modern reality television even if one isnt a jim carrey fan is definitely worth watching,black_comedy
when i first saw i was really impressedthat credit goes to mr peter weir and jim carrywithout watching the reviews and the rating i watched this movie it was excellentyou will not be bored for the first time and you will definitely like it this is a movie that should be watched by everyone of any ageif you understand the movie completely then there is no doubt you will like it i request you to not miss this masterpiece in your life1010,black_comedy
this movie jim carreys best performance i just couldnt stop watching this movie and i couldt take my eyes off of the screen i have never seen a movie like this in a long time the beginning was a little slow but it got more exciting and exciting as i kept watching this what i really like about this movie is that the whole movie is a show of a person the plot was brilliant i wouldnt think of anything like this if i was a movie directorwriter it was a little cheesy though the whole town looked like a video game the effects were a little off this movie was also sad and funny i recommend this movie to anyone you will like it my rating characters910 effecs 810 story 1010overall 910,black_comedy
what a concept  spoiler alert the concept is the usp of this movie i dont wanna ruin the pleasure of watching this movie so if you are planning to watch this movie skip this paragraphwhat will you do if you suddenly find out that the life you are leading is actually a planned life and its not planned by god or someone its planned by a tvshow creator also the entire world have watched you since your birth your life is just another tvshowthat is the situation which truman burbank finds himself in and tries to discover the world even the boat he uses to sail over the sea is metaphor santa maria was the name of the ship in which columbus discovers the worldjim carrey the funnyman is equally superb in both comedy and drama scenes here you see both of those 2 sides laura linney and noah emmerich are also good ed harris he has a knack of pulling some of the very best supporting performancefinally truman show is a show whoseeven a single episode should not be missed,black_comedy
the plot circles around truman jim carrey his entire world a small town is just a giant movie set there are hidden cameras and everybody else is an actoractress he however has no idea there are a couple of scenes that show people just glued to the tv watching the show and apparently it is the most popular show on tv the amazing thing about this unique plot is that it was released in 1998 when there werent all that many reality tv shows the show becomes more and more relevant with its message of people being hypnotized by reality tv and forgetting to live their own livesjim carrey is amazing unlike his other works dumb and dumber and others he doesnt do over the top comedy the humor in this movie is of a different sort it is more subtle this is carreys first serious movie and it is astounding how he didnt get an oscar nomination for his performance he proves himself as an excellent actor not just a funny man it is a shame he hasnt taken on more roles in similar dramasthe supporting cast is also great including ed harris who got nominated for best supporting actor for his role as director of the showit is a very unique movie with an underlying commentary on society and is full of great subtle comedy all of that is capped by jim carreys oscarworthy performance,black_comedy
the dramedy is directed by peter weir and stars jim carrey laura linney and ed harris the film takes place in a modern day film setthe film starts off with a man named christof harris telling how he created a television series where a persons life is watched from beginning to end this person is truman burbank carrey truman is a very nice person and he has no idea that his life is not normal and that he is actually on television he is married to meryl burbank linney who is an actress that is not really married to him so basically trumans whole life is scenarios set up by christof for the entertainment of the world to watch but soon truman starts to realize things and believes that something is wrongthe screenplay is from andrew niccol and it is his second his first being gattaca niccol received an oscar nomination for his writing and he does deserve it the film is extremely original and is a true pleasure to watch it is funny and full of drama and i just couldnt wait to see how it ended there are only a few minor problems with the screenplay and none of them made it not enjoyable one of them was the fact that there were no strong anti slavery groups against the show because in a way truman was a slave another is that there were some convenient slips of the tongue which made truman more suspicious besides those though it was an excellent screenplaythe direction of this film was also quite good peter weir as well earned an oscar nomination and yes he did earn it he really knew how to get great performances out of his actors every single one of them played their parts great the shots in the film were excellent as well and i just felt so absorbed i was rooting for truman the whole time and it is hard to get a person to like a character that much overall very good directionthe acting in this film was superb jim carrey gives a great performance as truman and this is one of the few performances that carrey has that is not a comedic role he is great being so innocent and warm hearted i just loved it whenever he said if i dont see you again later good afternoon good evening and good night laura linney was great as trumans pretend wife she acted like a not so great actress and it was really quite enjoyable to watch her try and make truman believe that his world is real one of my favorite parts of this film for me is when truman is questioning her and she just starts saying how great cocoa beans are for an advertisement she was just great ed harris was the creator of the show christof and he gave an excellent performance he received an oscar nomination for the intense creative mind and he deserved because while i was watching i could really feel how much he loved the world he created and the last thing he wanted to happen was for truman to destroy itoverall i give this film a very strong 810 i would recommend this film for anyone who likes creative films jim carrey or just really enjoyable films,black_comedy
i dont know why i compare the two but i think this movie is even better than terry gilliams amazing film classic brazil its just feels deeper and more moving its not that the whole amnesty int thing in brazil wasnt moving i just like peter weirs film betterpeter weir is an unusual and intelligent film maker his films never cater to mass taste and his early films are basically foreign indie films early peter weir films like pinic at hanging rock and the last wave are brilliant and intellectually provocative works of intense cinemathis has got to be peter weirs broadest film it plays to a broad audience and caters to mass taste even though weir worked with harrison ford on two movies witness and mosquito coast those movies had less of a broad audience appealtruman also has a timely quality that even seems more relevant today than ever with the influx of reality shows inundating the current media and with all the big brother conspiracy theories out there today reads kind of like a comedy conceived by george orwelland what can you say about jim carey excellent i cant believe he wasnt at least nominated for an oscar for this he makes truman burbank a cute likable even kind of schmaltzy character without losing the depth and serious side to the performancea brilliant and wonderful film it also should be noted that even though its aimed at adults nothing here is offensive and is suitable viewing for the whole family,black_comedy
if i were to sum up with one word it would be brilliant is a film on the level of grand classics a frenzy of bizarro humor and life time morals the movie manages to touch on themes of life faith and all while being a satire of reality tvnow im about twelve years late to the party but even in the new decade reality tv takes over the airwaves like no ones business is still culturally relevant if not more so nowadays than when it was released seriously the movie came out in an era where flavor of love hadnt existed yetthe story of is easy enough to say truman carrey is the center of a reality tv show and has been since his birth the story begins to unfold as he begins to discover this fact and if i said anything more id spoil the movie needless to say the plot weaves through the key themes i mentioned beforethere is no reason to not see this movie its a classic an instant love its easy on the real melodrama and if you were going to poke holes in it youd have to work hard to find one that mattered very much overall this movie leaves a message that is resoundingone of the best films to be released last decade one of the best films ever made,black_comedy
is a very funny very clever and unique film its central idea is very original and very thoughtprovoking and refreshing seeing the year it came out jim carrey gives a wonderful and heartfelt performance and it is obvious why so many people watch him on tv everyday he is very likable ed harris and laura linney are also fantastic when all is said and done this film feels like it was from the mind of charlie kauffman whose newer film synecdoche new york also has a similar idea the ending is perfect as is the final line which makes you realize probably the central idea in this film all in all this is a great film and one of carreys finest,black_comedy
is a fantastic movie with an extremely well developed storyline and a stellar cast you will never find a movie that is anything like it its incredibly unique if any other film tried to imitate it they would be caught straight away as we see a mans entire life filmed by a worldwide tekevsion show unbeknownst to him it really explores this interesting formula to a significant degree unlike some movies that often fail to deliver their full potential we see truman disovering the truth about his world and struggling to uncover it we also get to see the effect has had on the world and the most complex part of the film how they have managed to make the show work for all the years of trumans life there was no aspect that felt unexplored the cast is outstanding and were all very able to act with this unusual storyline jim carrey delivers one of the finest roles of his career being able to showcase his talent for both comedy and drama he has some hilarious parts but also plays a very complicated complex character very effectively carrey is also joined by talents such as the great underrated ed harris playing a man obsesssd with the world he has created natascha mcelhone shines as a woman who has fallen for a man she can never be with while laura linney and noah emmerich play two actors struggling to hide the truth from truman stellar acting all around funny dramatic intense whimsical and simply fun i find it hard to understand what i have done to deserve a movie as beautiful as truman burbank is a happily married salesman who soon starts to feel that the world revolves around him however what he does not know is hes the star of the worlds biggest reality show as he was legally adopted by a television corporation best performance jim carrey,black_comedy
a baby boy is adopted by a television company and made the subject of a 24hour soap opera he grows up and discovers his wife friends and neighbours are all acting their parts in his lifeis a dazzling smart satire on the media which now seems less implausible and even prophetic in the era of reality tv the creation of seahaven the idyllic town that is really a studio set is a breathtaking coup and the character of truman burbank finally does justice to jim carreys scattershot talents the film was a financial and critical success and earned numerous nominations at the 71st academy awards 56th golden globe awards 52nd british academy film awards and the saturn awards,black_comedy
after being blown away by fearless i set out to see more of peter weirs work along the way i came across after watching the film i have nothing but praise for this film is a truly dazzling and sophisticated satirical comedy drama on media omnipotence that benefits from fine direction and performances beautifully scripted by andrew niccol and flawlessly directed by weir the film is utterly captivating from the start right through to the truly poignant finale here carrey plays truman burbank the star of the worlds most popular reality show the catch is he doesnt know that truman believes he lives in seahaven an island community that is somewhat idyllic but in reality it is just a set housed in a studio with his friends and family as actors this realisation and how it comes across is ambitious admittedly then again i find weir a fairly ambitious director but it comes across as brilliant aside from the directing concept and script the acting really does soar here having loved his performances in liar liar and the mask i was looking forward to seeing jim carrey in a more dramatic role and his restrained performance while funny in partsin a subtle way in alternative to hysterical is very sympathetic and moving ed harris is great as christoff and laura linney is outstanding as meryl overall brilliant film it is funny but poignant too 1010 bethany cox,black_comedy
peter weirs film definitely lacks no innovation bringing us as it does the unique story of a man who is the central character in an amazingly longrunning television show that is all about him only catch is he doesnt know itwe have probably all felt that our lives were on show at one time or another or even imagined that we were the centre of some great movie i must admit to imagining myself in a situation just like trumans i never expected it to become the subject matter of a movie though it is probably no wonder that aussie director weir jumped at itweir does a pretty good job creating the world in which truman burbank lives maybe a reference to burbank studios in that name giving us a pseudoreality of which we are completely aware but of which truman has no concept weirs problems start when he has to decide where to take this groundbreaking film like peter howitts sliding doors it is very difficult to know how to close a movie whose very concept is capable of totally wowing its audience many may be disappointed with this films finale and some may even feel cheated out of a true ending others will cheer its all down to personal tastejim carrey upon whom the entire show rides impresses often as the bright cheery insurance salesman who starts to believe there may be something very wrong with his world he certainly has the right amount of charisma though whether his dramatic prowess was strong enough is debatable perhaps a classic actor would have done something completely different with this role support cast are merely incidental but include laura linney noah emmerich ed harris hollard taylor and natascha mcelhonehighly effective music comes from original composer burkhard dallwitz with additional pieces from philip glass the set an entirely fabricated island village is from production designer dennis gassnerfriday october 23 1998  greater union melbourne,black_comedy
the movie starts exactly at the point when truman begins to realize that hes living in a constructed reality soap opera a light of the artificial night sky falls down and nearly hits him but also the spectator of the movie begins to wonder about the strange things that happen to truman by and by the spectator gets aware of the fact that trumans life is filmed through thousands of hidden cameras and broadcasted live around the world what makes the story so extraordinary so the movie is definitely not just about an allday story therefore i think that the plot is quite original and innovative the fact that the spectator of the film gets inducted into trumans secret even earlier than truman himself makes his actions really funny and grippinghowever the story of truman isnt funny at all its rather tragic the plot and the well fitting music keep the film quite moving and the spectator begins to feel sympathy for trumanfinally the movie turns out well but the story keeps you thinking about todays tv and its influence on peopleall in all is a beautiful movie with a fascinating story and moving background music and though its already more than 10 years old i can thoroughly recommend you to watch it,black_comedy
this film is inspiring and captivating jim carrey pulls off the performance of his career and was ignored for an oscar nod ed harris does a believable job as a man playing god and provides a very artistic air to his work as christof and peter weir leads both these men to act out a very touching and emotional storyone of the most amazing things about this film is the elegant and abnormal camera anglestechniques that were used through this the audience believes that they are watching the tv show truman is unknowingly starring inbut most of all along with the excellent acting of jim carrey the music really helped this film bring about its emotional core the music really added another layer to the films overall essenceallinall is a story of exploration and desirewanting to be so much more than just normal truman wishes to be removed from his mundane activities and turn his dreams into a reality,black_comedy
an outstanding creation based on an extraordinary scenario this title does not disappoint even for a second is engaging funny and mysterious at the same time but most important is a film that launches a question shocking but completely necessary is the world we live in an illusion  are we treated with arrogance and are our rights violatedtruman is a common individual who works as an insurance salesman in town he sincerely loves his wife and always had a strange desire to go to fiji desire which never came to lifewhat he doesnt know is that his entire existence is in fact a very popular realityshow produced and directed by controversial figure christoff trumans life experience was so far fake and distorted everything he does is caught on tape his life is rendered with accuracy 24 hours a day 7 days a week obviously the television series was suggestively namedas time goes by truman begins to become suspiciousstep by step he rebels and decides to claim his entitled right to freedom will he get out of the universe created by christoff or not watch truman show and you will find outi was particularly impressed by this movie peter wier managed to render a masterly psychological and challenging experience in a concise way simple and to the point accessible to all for that he deserves all the praise he can get because as far as im concerned it is enormously difficult to express a profound message in a manner so classy and suggestivethe acting was good enough not great but still good jim carrey did very well as truman burbank the central character of this title not as well as he did in man on the moon for example but still he was satisfactory ed harris has exemplary shown christoffs character and perspective an eccentric genius willing to overlook any moral law in the name of television laura linney did just fine as she was quite convincing in her very intriguing role taking into account that she played a pretended wife who played an actress if you appreciate the ironyto conclude truman show is an impressive title which can not let anyone indifferent because of its spectacular scenario presented in such a suggestive sometimes even hilarious manner i appreciate it as one of the best films of the last 50 years and accordingly deserves a maximum  out of ,black_comedy
truman burbank jim carrey lives on a small town of seahaven is married to a pretty nurse meryl laura linney and has a job as an insurance sales man hes afraid of water because an accident that drowned his father and he is generally very well liked among the people of his little community yet he dreams of going awayone day a series of curious incidents lead him to believe theres something strange about his environment like if the whole world is revolving around him and funnily enough it is truman is with out his own knowledge a start of a reality show that had begun the very day he was born among unwanted babies he was chosen to be a star of a live broadcast viewed by millions of people all around the world dreaming of more simple world they live inis a well woven satire about the extremities of reality television despite it feels like a show revolving around a single clueless individual would be far fetched it doesnt feel like that at all when you compare it to a stream of reality nonsense in the tv today while the movie itself comes a tale of a man who is trying to travel to the edge of his own reality the other aspects of the movie good deal of criticism and very justified questions about the whole nature of reality tv grazeall in all the cast is solid and does a very good job ed harris is especially good as christof megalomaniac directorcreator of the show who is trying his hardest to keep truman in his place jim carrewy gives one of his best performances showing he can do serious work if given good enough script to work with while the music is used sparingly the soundtrack contains some very memorable tunesis one of those movies i usually watch from beginning to the end if i happen to catch it from the tv it is very well made movie and i would even consider it a classic on its own right,black_comedy
peter weir has made a name for himself that has earned him the reputation of an accomplished director i am not a fan of every single one of his films but is one of my favourite films i remember how impressed i was with the original concept of a man whose entire life is filmed for the world to see unbeknownst to him with reality shows being the it thing on current television as much as i loathe most of them this film is one of the first of its kind to raise the question regarding the value of privacy and its contribution to ones freedom weir very convincingly tells the story of truman burbank and his struggle for a new life i like the way he sets the miseenscene his story juxtaposes very well with the audiences in the movie reactions and the studios operation this is the first film through which jim carrey has gained credit for playing a noncomedic role carrey is fantastic in the title role and he is wonderfully supported by the manipulative ed harris and the phony laura linney note the funny appearances by holland taylor peter krause and paul giamatti the melodramatic background score is also efficiently used i can easily recommend this film to anyone and it has great repeat value,black_comedy
if i had to pick ten best movies from the 1990s would definitely be on the list just when it seems like there are no more truly original movies to be made blows me awayafter this movie came out i think the thought that this could be happening to me momentarily passed through everyones head at least once it really shows how expertly this film was madei feel like i can say that without a doubt in my mind that this is the best jim carrey has ever been i feel like he knew it as well he was absolutely perfect with his mix of seriousness and humor so much felt epic with this film remember the feeling when the shows director ordered to cue the sun or during the beautiful final scene when trumans sailboat hits the painted wall and then truman talks to the director and leaves it is all very large and epic feeling if you have not seen then this needs to be next on your list,black_comedy
ok i watched this film when it first came out in 1998 at the time i thought it was a very good film with undoubtedly the best performance by an actor that id ever seen at the time by none other than mr jim carrey i was never a big fan of this guy until his performance alone is worth the price of a rental only the recent performance by sharlto copley in district 9 is somewhat better than mr carreys over the years since it was released has become more relevant and far more potent and personal i watched it again a couple of nights ago and was shocked realizing while watching the film at how our current television programs have been overrun with reality shows and entertainment reality shows with what may be divine foresight mr peter weir and his crew created which depicts our reality show at its far extreme if you havent seen this and are a reality show fan then watch this movie and prepare to be shaken a tie for my number 2 spot with the green mile behind the number one film of all time the shawshank redemption and like shawshank i strongly believe that this films list of admirers will continue to grow such that it will be someday in the imdbs top 250 where it so rightfully belongs heck it should be in the top 10,black_comedy
i had to register on imdb just to review this movie its so hard to find a place to beginfirstly peter weir is now one of my favourite directors none of this movie was half hacked it was perfect from ground upevery actor was seamless as well as all being very talentedalso jim carry has gone from mediocre actorstrange comedian to a true star of comedywhile it isnt a full blown crude laugh out load comedy or a hard hitting drama etc it still draws you in and keeps you watchingthis film really does leave you sat in your chair staring blankly at the screen before saying to yourself what if,black_comedy
this is the best jim carrey movie that i have ever seen the people who recorded the reality show and acted are total dicks they messed with his mind attacked him and tried to force him to stay in the fake town it was so great when truman told off the evil director and left it would have been great if the director died during the film i imagined myself going up to him with a gun and shooting him in the head the sad thing is that there is people like him in real life that would do anything to make a profit even if it included brainwashing someone for thirty years im surprised that barely anyone outside the set had any problems with a persons whole life being manipulated,black_comedy
i agree that truman show deserved an oscar i agree that jim carrey deserved it and lastly i agree that the academy is mental sometimes this movie is a combination of good comedy and great story the story itself is so refreshing and thought provoking that one find this movie in their mind for a long time i felt the movie was intensely spiritual and absolutely hilarious you can actually relate the feeling of truman to ourselves the blow he gets when he realizes that whatever he thought was real wasnt not even loveand how someone is shaping his life according to a predetermined story the path truman chooses ie to find an answer and escape from the unreal world never giving up is what is truly remarkable it gives a message without boring us this movie is a landmark for hollywood,black_comedy
i may be rating this unusual film too low read the many good analyses of this filmunless you have not seen the moviego watch it first this 1998 film is sorta prophetic of 2009  onsee all the cameras on the streets in the storeson our computeror the neighbors hidden cell phonewatching us think of truman shows 5000 tiny camerasyou can see some when rewatching this movie and what of the high up controllerdirectorhe the great ed harris acts like a protective dad to carreys characterbut carreys possible death is a risk ed harris is willing to take will godlike persons experimenting wildly with our social order  moressimilarly be willing to do their society manipulating practices even if playing with the mores of society damages many of us and all the while carreys wife tells us of the latest in kitchen productsand that shes made macaroni for dinner,black_comedy

this movie is goodi saw movie because favorite actor was jim carrybut i temptation this movie synopsissynopsis in society critical theorybut not troublesome easy to understand on the contraryi give hearty recommendation also i recommendation of a writera actora producer an assistant film director and so on they great movie mani promise you with pleasure that is very good moviei believe your choice,black_comedy
i may after reflection come back  raise my rating comments above summarize the gist of this quality moviejim carrey does not play the wacky overboard comedy he is generally known for but  so what truman show may well outlast his other workthe director wisely avoided too many closeups on carreys famous mobile face carrey uses his wholse self to act out his anguish joy other emotion his eyes from a slight distance show his emotionthe other supporting actors are good at their minor trickery  the false god of carreys universe is played well by ed harris while some might see him as a standin for god he better fits the profile of the satanic but goodappearing angel of light,black_comedy
this is a deceptively simple film the central plot twist is what keeps the film fresh along with impressive acting by jim carrey who plays truman unfortunately i was aware of the plot line before watching the film still carrey is hugely likable here and his minor spoilers climactic sea struggle is riveting to watch the film takes amusing potshots at everyone people who are utterly absorbed by television shows the producers as well as the actors i however wanted more background information on truman as well as more details on his relationship with his wife still recommended as an uplifting cautionary fableoverall 810,black_comedy
so i had my first experience with 10 years after it was made and man the impact someones going to say i took it too seriously but i guess thats the way it is thenthe reason that i didnt go see this movie before is that it had jim carrey written all over it i have grown to dislike jim carrey for the very reason for which he is the star he is  pulling faces i believe im not the only one who has been wondering whether its all that hes good for it works for the mask and ace ventura but a lot of others i dont knowhaving that said i spent a few moments trying to think who else could have pulled this one off carrey kind of reminds me of jack nicholson every other actor sort of pale next to nicholson and carrey they do the conventional acting thing while these two do their own thing so props for thati believe this movie was labeled a comedy just because of jim carrey and that hes supposed to be a comedian however this movie didnt strike me as a comedy instead i was scared disturbedeverybody laments over how money makes the world turn around underneath this movie offers a point of view on that how far can that actually be taken surely is an exaggeration on the subject it also simultaneously exaggerates the fact that people dont care as long as they get their fix moreover the fact that people dont care theres even a part in the movie where its freely discussed in the media like it was okay to make a lab rat out of truman burbank mcelhones character sylvialauren voices criticism and points out how cruel it is in my opinion its critical for the success of this movie props again and in the very end christoph the director is brought on almost as if he was a god and theres no denying that hes playing a godalright ive said a lot but if you guys are thinking im slamming this movie youve mistaken read oni feel that this movie has very little comedy value surely some aspects of it are brought across by means of comedy but that still doesnt make it one however i feel thats not important though i feel that it gives you something to think about if you scratch a bit deeper than the surfaceand therein lies the greatness of the movie worth of the 10 stars i gave it,black_comedy
when i look at films as a amateur photographer and cameraman myself i love to look at the photography of a film the way a sequence of well chosen shots have made the movie for mebut in it is not the photography that stands out ok theres the vignetting of the shots to show that you are watching from a hidden camera but what makes the film really stand out is the concept this film is conceptually brilliant and jim carey brings it to lifebrings together philosophical meaning a bit of fun and of course that love interest in a way that just works,black_comedy
jim carrey is overdue being lauded as one of the great american actors especially after his performance inwritten by andrew niccol gattaca 1997 in an audacious fit of prescience truman burbank carrey is an unsuspecting pawn in the most ambitious reality show ever conceived  while the world watches a complete community of actors creates an anytown america reality for one unsuspecting protagonist  truman  raised from birth in a massive thunderdome encompassing the town of seahaven where even the weather and the sky the sun and moon are computer programswe pick up the story when truman is 30 ambivalently married to meryl laura linney downing the occasional brewski with best friend marlon noah emmerich and cruising listlessly through his unrewarding insurance job one million hidden cameras broadcast his every movehe might have continued the leave it to beaver lifestyle till his death were it not for a few unrelated events that created a glitch in his perception of reality allowing him to discover that his reality was someone elses fiction  an intricately complex microcosm of the real worldand therein lies the hook of directed by peter weir gallipoli 1981 dead poets society 1989 this movie poses the ultimate question is reality what we perceive it to be long have we stood solid on the credos seeing is believing and perception is reality but this movie proves the fragility of those precepts we perceive all our realities through points of reference  we are told this is the sky the sun the city we are told a day is 24 hours long from an arbitrary measurement which is not entirely accurate we have agreed on the nature of things truth murder war dishonesty and though we think that all we see is real and all we feel is untampered emotions the media through unreliable sources television news reports tabloids governments force our perception through a common strainer molding reality to their endsthis movie is also testament that the inquiring mind cannot be contained no matter the inculcation truman wants to discover new horizons to think outside his box when computer glitches alert him to his being watched it inspires him to get to the bottom of the mysterythe movie takes us outside the prison beyond the dome with creator of christof ed harris in a chilling rendition of a god complex  the name christof is no accident giving us flashbacks of trumans early years including a chance meeting with a female extra lauren natascha mcelhone while the script called for truman to meet and marry meryl he fell for lauren while christofs scripters scrambled to excise lauren from the storyline of trumans life his true emotions would lead him to forever pine for lauren going so far as to clandestinely construct a composite picture of her face from magazine modelslook for paul giamatti preawards as the sympathetic control room director and harry shearer perfect as christofs interviewer brian delate who must be sick to death of people asking him are you charles grodin plays trumans fatherback in 1998 it may have been considered unlikely that the major players in trumans fantasy  his wife and best friend  would give up their own lives and aspirations to be a part of trumans fiction but after the advent of execrable stupidities like who wants to marry a millionaire 2000 or the bachelor 2002 it has become somewhat acceptable for monetary gain infamy and exposure as an ignorant git to replace brains aspirations and even what people consider their very souls hollywood synergy read as tacit plagiarism also saw the release of a similarthemed inferior reality movie edtv in 1999 whereas truman exposed numerous layers of hypocrisy in our society edtv was as thematically deep as a slipnslideeventually truman undergoes a reverse copernican revolution where he discovers that the sun moon and society itself really did revolve around him  and instead of finding fulfillment discovers emptiness in being the center of the universein the greatest irony of all truman tries to escape his seahaven prison knowing that after escaping into the real world he would become an unknown unlike all the drogues in the reality shows that would come on the heels of this movie truman wants to be just another face in the crowd not singled out or made a fuss over  yet it was his drive and uniqueness that enabled him to see beyond his imprisonment and yearn for fulfillment in the first placeat times poignant at times funny always an undertone of darkness is a metaphor for the pioneering spirit which cannot be contained never more apparent than the final scenes where truman pounds on the bluesky wall as burkhard von dallwitzs soundtrack swells to tearwelling proportionsthe paradoxical and disturbing messages in this movie should be examined for decades to come instead the voyeuristic aspect of has been catapulted to brainleaching proportions by a society that would more readily watch reality than live it,black_comedy
i was feeling a little down and tired this afternoon and so decided to dust off an old friend who turned out to be i was reminded of its quality in script performance and oddly enough presentation its realism is confirmed by my nephew who at the age six and a half cried because he thought truman was a real person caught in a real mouse trap he is no fool not then not now ten years on and we now have a plethora of reality tv shows it leads to the question when will we get tired of them when will we demand more face it a lot of us see them as more ridiculous and counterfeit than reality but in the end it is the entertainment value that continues to draw me and of course how can i pass up jim and ed,black_comedy
kind of a complicated business this film most of peter weirs movies are but at least he lays open here the source of our discomfort its a palimpsest of basically three layers 1 the visual story we see unfolding on the screen the one that peter weir shows us 2 the story as constructed by the worlds greatest producer the man in the moon named cristof ed harris who manages the television show of which the thirtyish realestate salesman truman burbank jim carrey is the unknowing star and 3 the presumed allegory that deals with such big issues as conformity happiness god free will artifice and televisioncarrey lives on glossy carefully enameled sea haven island a paradisaical place of warm sunshine neat middleclass housing clipped and barbered lawns cheery neighbors and coworkers a beautiful and accommodating wife laura linney and a lifelong friend who bring him the occasional six pack of brewskies everything is peace and prosperity then things begin to seem a little odd to carrey when he breaks his routine he stumbles into unsettling scenes what should be the interior of an elevator turns out to be a craft service table with glazed donuts and a few strangers who gawk at him before running offthere isnt space to go on with this in any detail but finally carrey realizes that he can trust no one on the island and is literally a prisoner there every escape attempt is blocked by some incident  traffic an accident at a nuclear power plant  something he manages to sail away across the small sea and pow the bowsprit of his little boat punctures the wall of the largest television studio in the world his life is a worldwide hit on tv filmed on 5000 hidden cameras given a choice between the scripted almost perfect life hes been leading and a new life full of challenges and entropy he plumps for  well guess which oneas for level number two the tv program built around the life of one truman burbank who has been on the worlds screens from the instant of birth until his final choice ed harris is the man responsible and he and his crew live in the fake moon that hovers so picturesquely in sea havens night time sky harris gives the best performance his character brims with intricacies his first thoughts are of the show of the business part of it its sustained by product placement every artifact that carrey touches or talks about brings in revenue but harris isnt at all a caricature of course he wants carrey to stay put and the show to continue but hes sentimental too when he tells carrey at the end i was there when you took your first baby steps hes soft and convincing but as the director of the worlds greatest show harris is pretty clumsy and its a wonder that it took the hero some thirty years to tumble carrey tries to leave the island on a bus but the bus wont start the driver an actor calls everybody off and the other passengers who have been sitting like dummies all stand up at once and file out in order thats not how its done not if its to look like anything but acting an experienced director would ask who was born in the first half of the year they should stand up at random some slow and others not and crowd up at the door followed by those who were born in the second half of the year in fact harris is an extraordinarily inept directorthat leads us to level three  whats it all about id be the first to admit i dont know peter weir might even be the second i doubt though that its any accident that ed harriss director who lives in the fake sky goes by the name of cristof his mixed attitude towards carrey is probably not accidental either harris has fits of pique when carrey doesnt do as hes expected cf the garden of eden business in genesis but hes merciful and spares the miscreants life edging into new testament territory if hes sometimes careless maybe thats why we humans have this tendency to mutilate one another imagine a director who can stage an impromptu power plant accident offisland to stop carrey but has extras check their watches before crossing the street what then did the hand of the potter shake the world applauds when carrey achieves free will although nobody is sure thats such a hot idea look what happened to alex in a clockwork orange no more space im afraid good luck with the movie it gets a lot of points for tripping up an audience expecting a dumb comedy or a dumb action movie its anything but that weir seems almost as ambitious as cristofone final question why in hell would an entire outside world be enthralled by a tv program about the life of a dull man but maybe its not worth asking in light of the popularity of reality tv shows like american idol and survivor,black_comedy
this film is admirably original in its premise but its execution leaves something to be desired with andrew niccols deftly original screenplay had the potential to be an american classic along the lines of paddy chayefskys network instead director peter weir elected to make a high concept hollywood comedy with bankable funnyman jim carrey as his star the story unravels in a somewhat choppy manner coveting easy laughs instead of fully realizing the satirical power at its core in fact the comedy specifically the cutaways to show viewers and the interview segment with the creator is rather banal and uninspired as for jim carrey to his credit he does a fine job balancing comedy and drama particularly in the films climactic rite of passage,black_comedy
the motion pictureis not so much an interest but a shockthe picture is not only a discredit but such a fallacious argument as to set back the human race some 150 yearsthe reference to 150 years was to refer to a time when there was a civil war in what was then the united states against the confederate states of americathe conflict was to cause the abolishment of slavery as an exercise in any state right issue whereby a human being was denied the right to lifeliberty and the pursuit to happinessis a latter day attempt to undermine the very foundations of that which there was given the last full measure so that we might enjoy a new birth of freedoma paraphrase taken from the gettysburg address when spoken in july 1863 by then president abraham lincolnthere is in fact such an arrogant position had by this film that we might be said to enter into a new world order whereby a state is indeed introduced as a godless overseer and right holder to the human beingthere is such an inbred contempt for trevor burbank who is the victim of this raid of the heart that a story told by civil war historian shelby footetold of a slave who was the property of an over seer on a virginia plantationthe slave managed to escape and won his freedom by moving stealthily through the underground railroad to a community north of the confederate territoryhe was as fate would have itto join union forces and at a time later was to be part of a union move against the south whereby he would come directly across the very land whereby he was once a slavethe story told of the very deliberate seeking out and killing of the overseer with whom he was in slaved toif this be worth anything it would be that trevor burbank should not only seek out and kill christoph but every person directly associated with the broadcastthis is more than a mere crime this is slaverythe degree to which the ways of this world have parted is that we hardly recognize ourselves because with the passing of time came the advent of telecommunications and the conceit of another form though in fact it was to be the same old story yet in another formthat is what we are in fact looking out in thisthe truman burbank showit is a very real attempt to thumb there noses at the foundations of a democracy and flaunt their victimization of one truman burbankthe characterization of all those around the life of truman burbank share not common ground to such an extent that all of life seems merely to be lacking in color and even back bonesuch is the offensethis coldly impersonal affront even onto decency is so vile as to be culpable and worthy to die as many times as necessary so as to rid the world of this malady once and for allchristof should be sought out as stealthily as the story told of the former slave noted above and killedbecause he is a godless monsterthis order should be done with due diligence and with prejudice aforethought so that all associated with this event should see the end of their days on this earththere is nothing timid in this attempt to silence a heart beat and there should not be anything timid in its roar back as welllet the human heart roar back at the attempt upon its place here as this system is as in human as it is a new world orderthere is nothing here but a discredit and it is nothing but a discredit that is represented but this attempt upon our place in this worldthough we are in fact looking at a motion picturethe entertainment vehicle that it represents is not entertaining at all but in fact represents a hatred for honestyfor nature and for lovethis film is an unnatural affront to entertainment and goes beyond mere viewing pleasure to a virtual contempt for civilizationthis film is in fact a very violent attack upon life and can be construed as a promise of what maybe coming to a theater near youyou as a theater going public are warned of the propensity to pooh pooh this hatred and dismiss it without the right of way being taken backthe inability to right the wrong breaches the very cloth so sacred in our devotion to dutyhonor and fidelitythere is present a matter of life and death with only judgement to wish for in the passing of the daysthe end time is now upon this world and it is indeed a time to judge those who have sought to judge uslet this be a prophecy foretold,black_comedy
i saw this movie for a film class at my high school it was alright the idea of is essentially that a television producer called christof ed harris has created a fake world for truman jim carrey in this fake island called seahaven truman has a wife laura linney friends and a job trumans life is a hit tv show broadcast all over the world with truman not even knowing but certain things reveal the truth and truman deceiving the 5000 cameras and all of the crew and cast sets off on a boat hes afraid of water since his dad mysteriously died in an accident in reality it was fake he reaches the end of the island and crashes into the edge of the set he finds the exit door but christof tries to stop him truman bows and leaves his phony world for ever,black_comedy
this was a movie that intrigued me from my first viewing of the trailer it seemed so fresh so new too often trailers seem to advertise a movie you have seen many times before the concept is audacious if not entirely plausible but the real strength is in the dialogue and the performances jim carey grates very occasionally but the rest of the cast is spot on the ways in which trumans friends and family profess their affection while simultaneously betraying him are funny sad and lacerating all at the same time repeated viewings have not dulled the edge of this modern morality talereality tv was not such a ubiquitous presence when this movie was made and i hope ardently for its eventual demise so that this movie has become more relevant and less unlikely with every passing year,black_comedy

this is one of the most creative movies i have ever watchedstars jim carrey as truman burbank who is a salesman who suspects that his life isnt as normal as it would seem as he is unknowingly the star of a reality television show which is filming 247 that is focused on his life entirelywhen i first heard of this moviei thought it would be a comedy but i soon realised it was more of a drama however there was still some comedy in itthe film also has a good supporting cast in the form of laura linneynoah emmerich and ed harrisit also had a good director in the form of peter weir but the one thing that should have been done is that the academy should have at least given jim carrey an academy award nomination for best actor as he rightfully deserved to be nominated at least and because he is a great actor but would be hollywoods most underrated actorbut either waythis film was a very great and creative film,black_comedy
stars jim carrey as truman burbank an accountant that lives in a small town called seahaven truman thinks of himself as an ordinary guy he is married has a house has a decent job and has a decent life little does truman know that he lives in a world created around him truman is the star of a tv show broadcasted around the world his own life is on display for the world to see in the film truman becomes suspicious of the world around him events occur that baffle him truman knows something strange is going on but does not know whatchristoff played by ed harris is the creator of the show as you watch the film you see that boundaries have been set for truman at a young age truman was discouraged by everyone to not explore of course being that it is a tv show everyone is an actor or actress his mom and dad his best friend his wife and everyone he sees on the streets everyday is a professional actor or actress trumans whole enviorment is fake and scripted except for himself he doesnt even have a real father or mother truman was a testtube baby his life is controlled its almost like he has been enslaved trumans own enviorment is not even real the entire town and area he lives in is inside a huge dome the sun moon wind rain and clouds is all fake christoff plays god and controls trumans lifetruman progresses through the film he begins to notice that strange things are happening around him things he cant explain he knows his wife does not love him and he notices that everything seems to be repeating itself like a routine everyday seems the same nothing changes during the film truman conquers his fears and breaks through barriers that he nor did christoff think was possiblethis was definitely jim careys best performance of his career he plays this serious role very well and at the same time adds a little zest to the character that no one else can do jim carey is very good at showing emotions which was needed in this filmthis film also tackled the possible future of entertainment during the film there are random clips of people watching truman on tv people laugh and cry with truman as they watch but as a viewer of the film you want to curse at christoff and all those people who watch the show because you feel sympathy for truman you as the viewer start to care about truman as you watch the film you want truman to find out what has been going onthe film had great directing great cinematography great acting and great music everything in this film flowed very well the initial plot grabbed me and the great acting and writing sealed the deal i would call this film a borderline masterpieceif you are a fan of jim carey or if you want to see a great film then look no further and watch,black_comedy
i still remember the first scene that the spot light fell down from the skyit implied the whole world was fake i still remember he came out of the house greeting everybodyin the morningthen he greeted again when he left  i still remember the face when he touched the sky if the sky is real he cannot be free if it is fake how can he stay still and function like beforewhen he met his father again he touched the whole world people give him fake attitudes but he returns the realalwaysits broken my heart said one of the managers yeahreally break i cannot drive said the driver yeahhe is just one actor and so to be a real person not to be an actor when you lie you will be hurttoohuman is more friendly than the other animals because he can smile and he can pretend to smile,black_comedy
the truman spoilers truman burbank jim carrey is the first child legally adopted by a corporation but more importantly he is the star of the n1 reality show created by mogul kristof ed harrishis life seems idyllic despite having lost his father when he was young but when he crosses paths with lauren natascha mcelhone as a college student and she tells him that her real names sylvia and that hes into a tv show he begins to have some doubtsdoubts that come back with a vengeance when on day 10909 something weird falls from the sky and as the days pass he notices other things and ends up suspecting that everyone from his mother holland taylor to his boss peter krause to his wife laura linney and to his best friend noah emmerichso he decides to face his fears and find out if his suspects are realthe movie that showed jim carrey was an actual actor and not just a buffoon this almost10yearold classic is surprisingly plausible as a worstcase scenario of the reality show craze  and it was made before themkudos to every actor especially peter krause who manages to shine in a really little part910,black_comedy
1998 directed by peter weir is a story of an ordinary man who does not know that he is a star of a long running show that started on the day he was born and depicts every smallest detail of his life in a picture perfect small town of seahaven for all world to see everything and everybody around him is not real including his family his friends his job and the whole world that seems so friendly and familiar the ultimate irony is in his name  he is the only true man among the actorsjim carreys performance is a revelation and it is still a mystery for me why he was overlooked by the academy of motion pictures that year and was not rewarded for his superlative work hes been helped by laura lynney and ed harris great performance the true star of the movie is peter weirs directing  he is the real creator of this theater of absurd,black_comedy
was released straight after jim carrey had come out with funny movies like ace ventura the mask dumb and dumber and liar liar  all basically back to back i recall tts being marketed as just another funny jim carrey movie and for this reason and the fact that his previous popular movies were all very comical general expectations were that it was the next laughoutloud carrey movie with his unique style of pulling faces and elastic slap stick style comedy i must say i didnt enjoy this movie so much when i first saw it in the cinema because i didnt appreciate the concept i was also a teenager looking for the usual fun and laughs from watching a carrey movie but after having watched carrey films that followed such as man on the moon the majestic a personal favourite and eternal sunshine for the spotless mind i appreciate what a fantastic actor the man is his ability to play funny man is matched in his ability to be taken seriously he shouldve had an oscar in his hand ages ago particularly for his performance in i strongly believe that had this movie been released within the last couple of years in the age of reality tv where more people would understand and relate to the concept it wouldve received the appreciation it deserves and carrey wouldve been nominated for an academy award at the very least,black_comedy
pretty good show about a guy whose whole life is televised live without him knowing it throughout the world truman burbank jim carrey has spent his 30 years since birth living inside a giant studio that must be 15 or so miles across interacting with friends and parents and wives who are just actors hes been fooled all these years but finally hes starting to wonder wtf is going onjim carrey does a great job and so too natasha ncelhone as the beauty who really cares about him  in contrast to his wife and best friend but the real credit has to go to the director who made sure this potentially confusing movie was in fact not confusing at alli love paranoia movies and this is a good one incidentally my post title is a quote from trumans wife to him it just struck me as funny,black_comedy
this is a very entertaining movie not classic material mind you but a nice little movie without great mistakes jim carreys acting shows a certain improvement since his funny faces are not there anymore ed harris performance as the cold hearted christof is actually very good nominated for an oscar if memory serves right the plot is quite original and even though t has its similarities with edtv personally i like the treatment it got in this movie the subtle psychological manipulation of truman burbank to keep him from finding out that he is just a character in a reality show has some orwellian spin 1984 big brother the final scene when truman overcomes his fears and finally finds out the truth its really well done all and all its not a really big film but its good enough for a rainy weekend at home with the family rent it 710,black_comedy
is about a man named truman jim carrey truman is living a normal life he has a job a wife and a dedicated best friend what he doesnt know is that his whole life is a tv show the world around him is a tv set and the people he interacts with including his wife parents and best friend are actors from the time he was born trumans life has been filmed 247 by a complicated network of thousands of tiny cameras and broadcast unedited and uncensored to the public truman of course suspects nothing because as the creator of the show cristof ed harris said we accept the reality of the world with which we are presented now that would apply to truman if it were not for one thing in high school a woman that he fell in love with natascha mcelhone told him what was really going on at the time he didnt understand and as a result remained more focused on the fact that the people escorting her away told him she was moving to the fiji islands truman has ever since been obsessed with going there and when his progress is continually inhibited he begins to suspect that something is going onis a very fascinating movie it is a combination of the book 1984 and those star trek episodes where commander ryker was in a holodeck without knowing it the cast lying through their teeth to through truman off reminded me of those intense intriguing stories it is also a very strange movie during the first tentwenty minutes of the movie i wondered if it was going to be any good stay with it and fear not let me assure you that this is a very good movie once you get past the beginning then you should be finein terms of acting i think the cast pulled it off fairly well jim carrey was excellent overall but there were several instances and even the better part of the beginning where i felt they cast the wrong person dont get me wrong carrey was the perfect man for the job its just that he could have done a little better in a few select parts this is a movie where you will have to suspend you disbelief a little the basic plot pretty implausible with all the human rights groups and peoples tv viewing habits but that is why it is classified as science fiction but in terms of the way peter weir pulled of the story and jim carrey pulled off his character so close to perfection the movie seems very plausible i highly recommend this movie84,black_comedy
hi reading movies beneath the screenplay is what i like doingrather watching what was put on screen i like guessing why was that something put on screen that wayas i saw this movie it did give me an insight of myself i mean the sight to look at life when you prevent yourself from exploring to just be assure tat something was somewhere waiting fro us but not actually doing things to reach the destination and get the bingo but yes this concept this movie has given me sight to view world as a programmed one and nobody but only one self can change things from getting programmed also when i read the details of this movie i loved giving a second thought to each detail which was actually origin of world class theorieslife is programmed or do we make it programmed for ourselveshuh its yet to all of us to decidethe part that i liked about the movie was when christof talks to slyvia about truman how he never stopped truman but it was his fear and his lack of confidence to explore that made him stuck to the show and what he called as programmed life also the part where marlon speaks to truman is excellently shot very unpredictable which takes ones emotion and sympathy fro truman to parhey but the concluding part in fact the last line by truman you never had camera in my head brings out a great controversytoo good and a must watch movie,black_comedy
its been a very long time since ive watched a movie and after that discussed about it with my roommate he watched it with me so much its an excellent movie to watch and youve got see it if you havent done it already my friendits the only thing that i was hoping for all movie its when he meets that girl and have a good time together but the movie ended just at the edge of their meeting ha but its clear he met her after the movie anyway see you on next good movie where jim carrey is onps its one of the best jims performance i also loved eternal sunshine of the spotless mind,black_comedy
the first one who imagined a concept similar to is plato it is known today as the allegory of the cave the great philosopher told the story of a man chained up in a cave and forced to see the shadows made by a fire assuming that its the real life ultimately he discovers that what he saw was fake and he tries to accommodate to realitytwentytwo hundred years later plato is replaced by australian filmmaker peter weir and the sinister cave is now called reality television the allegory is now calledjim carrey plays truman burbank an insurance company employee who is also the star of the show although hes not aware of it he lives in what for him is seahaven which is in fact a giant domedstudio located just outside la he obviously never left seahaven of his lifeseahaven is supposed to be a peaceful city located on an island on the seaside in order to keep truman in the city the crew finds many ways including cutting off bridges and simulating a nuclear accident moreover truman cant leave by the sea because the producers voluntarily infused him with hydrophobia when his father died in a boat accidenthowever in recent days many strange events occur and lead truman to believe that something is not right in seahaven a plane piece falls from the sky but truman finds that it strangely looks like a projector and theres also that elevator whose back falls and let see the crew for a secondthis sounds like a crazy and overly exaggerated media satire but theres one place where wins the timing couldnt have been better in a modern society where reality shows invade the little screen is a strong metaphor of the dangers and the consequences of permanent broadcasting of a persons lifethe movie is not perfect but just its concept makes it a winner the acting is good especially when you think that this movie is fictionwithinfiction there are two movies in a single one jim carrey is only aware of half of it and it looks real carrey gets one of his greatest roles mainly because he finally shows what hes able to do and he shows that maniac comedy is not the only thing he can doed harris appears as christof the creator and the director of the show hes responsible for the machiavellian tricks made in order to thwart trumans escape plans and to keep him in seahaven this determination is wellhidden by his cold regard and his continuous calmnessthe greatest characters of the movie are perhaps the viewers themselves as we regularly see them at different moments every time theyre at the same time at the same place doing the same thing just like if there was nothing else to do or maybe nothing important to dothey are the figures that stand for todays realityshow viewers theyre stuck in front of their tvs like if nothing else mattered and there was nothing else to do like if it was as essential as breathing theyre not aware that theyre wasting their own lives watching the same person living his own lifetheres a quote from christof that i like i am the creator of a television show that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions thats how a real tv director would speak by telling lies by telling what appear to be good words which are in fact empty words this is the kind of hidden quotes that are part of the linking between the satire and the realitythe only major gap between satire and reality in and perhaps the most arguable aspect of it is that truman burbank is not aware that hes constantly filmed in reality shows people know that theyre filmed its just that the overabundance of cameras and tests ultimately drive them crazy it would have provided an even more powerful movie but as long as this movie is good its less worryingwhat is different about platos allegory and is that the latter doesnt have any conclusion in the allegory the man gets out of the cave and has to face the sunlight and after a long time he succeeds the last image we get from truman is when he gets out from the studio and we never see him contemplating the real world so we dont know whats gonna happen we dont know how he will face the sunlightwe dont see him so good afternoon good evening and good night truman,black_comedy

it really changed my mind about jim carrey now im not a big fan of jim i think he is witty stupid and quite irresponsible i always find that in every movie he is in he does something stupid not in this one though this movie is one of my favorites of all time who thought up this scenario i dont know but it was an amazing piece to watch i must tell you i cried near the end i usually never cry over movies unless they are sad but it had the music too and it was really good jim carrey showed me that he can be sensible in one movie and im sure if you ask people what is one of jims best performances theyd say the trueman show right back at you i remember the scenes so well even though i have only seen it twice since it was released i guess what they say it true a good movie stays with you forever now i would recommend this movie to any of you out there i gave it a 1010 which is quite unusual for me but i really did love this masterpiece so if your considering it please dothis movie finally makes you think about life if anyone has ever seen bruce almighty with jim carrey it is the same kind of thing of course every movie has to have humor which it does jim carrey is excellent in this movie along with the other costars for ittrueman is the most famous person in the worldbut he doesnt know it,black_comedy

this is one of the best movies ive seen in a long time has possibly the most original and thought provoking themes that i have ever seen on film at first glance this movie seems sloppy confusing and a waste of time but dont jump to conclusions as you watch you will find yourself growing more and more excited this movie carries you like a dream with great acting and imaginative writing anyone will fall in love with truman wishing the best for him as he sets out to conquer the makers of as you find out how more and more people in trumans life are fake you will eventually wonder if youre watching a regular movie or someones nightmare ed harris is smooth as silk and cool as a cucumber as he plays the directorial genius and at the same time you will see little touches of a madman i would not doubt it if someone starts out saying that the movie is dull pointless and absolutely dumb and finishes the film saying that it was the best movie they have ever seen the acting is totally different than anything i have ever seen and the directing has the kubrick feeling truly amazing accomplishment in film,black_comedy
christof the omnipotent authoritative mediasavvy producerdirector in is identified with christian everything from sunrisesunset to each passerby in the utopian town named seahaven is in his charge without mentioning truman the leading role in this show since the day he was born truman has been taken good care of by a crop of actors and actresses and functioned as the protagonist of an international televised 24houraday series called 5000 hidden cameras follow truman everywhere he goes chronicling every trivia of his growth unknown to him is the trick known to alluntil someday from nowhere falls a light equipment later he is soaked in his own rainstorm when he moves the rain moves after him then through an oversight his lostatsea father is rearranged into the show again appearing like a transient in the street truman is puzzled by all these inconsistencies whats worse on his way to work one day the radio gets adrift to report his trace in every detail due to a slip of technique its paradoxical to call these inconsistencies deliberate coincidences because thats what christof hates but peter weif and andrew niccol expectswe have no doubt carelessness beyond control is here and there in trumans life its only a matter of time before truman to piece out the loopholes together and find out the truth he is determined to leave the counterfeit world when he is exposed mercilessly to the fact that this socalled perfect life he leads is no more than a showbiz illusion where only he is true while others exit merely as walkons since all other transport doesnt serve him he chooses sea in order to keep him from leaving seahaven he has been inculcated with a fear of water he has expectedly developed a phobia of water since the night his father lost at sea a catastrophe designed to frighten him having survived all weird rainstorms under christofs control he sails cheerfully to his dream world only to find the sky the clouds looking so beautiful in distance are pictures in a wall and the horizon itself leads nowherejim carrey plays truman he is so likable an actor that you cannot refuse any film he takes part in most of his films are characteristic of his hilarious performances but his role in this one is i should say light year away from the antics he used to do he is quite controlled and convincingas a sharpwitted intriguing and offbeat piece of entertainment the film can be dissected from different angles and it inevitably raises some questions to me the end is hallucination i admit the end is hopeful to most audience it seems to reach to consummate when truman opens the door in the wall and strides out we are about to applause wait a second where will he go into a world full of new lies leaving former lies behind so id rather have a hateful end,black_comedy
jim carrey ace ventura stars as truman burbank a simple man who is being filmed 24 hours a day and 7 days a week only truman doesnt knowfor years carrey had been lighting up screens with his wonderful comic talent in the mask ace ventura and batman forever this peter weir comedy drama was the first role carrey was able to give a more serious and dramatic role which earned him his first golden globe showing the viewing public he could perform at a serious level rather than constant slapstick his sentimental portrayal of a man who wants a bit more out of life is excellent dramatic and also a sign of hope for the watching audience of which was vital though i love carreys humour in previous films i personally felt it was necessary to see a different side to him and he pulls it off so wellthe character truman is a real joy to watch a symbol of hope and joy for the viewing public having a lot to deal with such as a stressful job and a complicated life with the loss of a loved one puts viewers at ease as it embodies what other people go through to watch someone else go through it with a positive energy justifies the viewing audience having a goal also is inspiring and a great human characteristicthe plot is consistent with an excellent setting and idea behind it we see typical objects and ideas associated with the reality tv genre such as acting props and of course the main setting for the show which is the whole world truman lives in a real landmark for the reality genre and is executed brilliantly with a real sophisticated approach to it where everyone is in certain place at certain times which all revolve around the central protagonist which makes the film slightly humorous togreat support is given from oscar nominated ed harris who plays the creator of the show laura linney love actually also performs well as trumans wifeand with such a joyous and determined central protagonist will keep you hooked right to the inspiring and heartwarming final,black_comedy
has brought me to a new level of suspense and wonder it captured me with the great plot and script jim carry is at his best in this film all of the emotions were unbearable and are sure to take your breath away and add a tear to your eye other movies try to conciel the emotions that are possessed by the main characters this movie will have you guessing all the way through only to find you were wrong and the extreme twist us unraveled this film is like opening a new door to wonder and suspense and you will want to open the door and never come out is flying on an eagles wings soaring to new heights in the movie history,black_comedy
paranoia is a strange mental condition the belief that others are plotting against youif youve ever had paranoia then this isnt the movie for you if youre already of stable mind then its a 10 out of 10 if youre not of stable mind it will definitely make you paranoid even more much more much much more incredibly sopinch yourself is this really your life to do with whatever is your mother your mother your father your father your best friend your best friend and even your wife your wife in other words are you being manipulated does the town where you live in really exist do you even exist i liked this film so what does that make me stable or paranoid lol a great film amazing jims best when hes acting straight or even partially straight a much better actor,black_comedy
the truman showi thought was a really clever film and a very likable one too the main characters are truman burbank and meryl played by jim carrey and laura linney the movie was about a person called truman that has spent 10909 days his whole life in this fake town doing his day to day activities like anyone would not knowing that its all fake and a setup an idea that the director wanted to get across was that realty and unreality are ideas that people should think about in your life and sometimes you dont know whats really real and whats not i would compare to the mask because jim carrey although in a completely different movie still acts well,black_comedy
i think was a really great film partly because of the way the directors and the actors made every thing look so real the characters i liked the most was truman burbank jim carrey because he makes everything seem so funny this movie is about a man named truman burbank how lives in a place called seaveiw which is a fake city its made in a big dometruman has been i there since he was born and doesnt no that its not true as there are actors that pretended to know himin the end truman finds out and leaves for the big wide world i think the director tried to get a cross that maybe the real big wide world isnt perfect for every person this film compared to other films jim carey has done such as the maskpet detectiveme myself and irene is one of the best i have seen,black_comedy
this movie is about a man called truman burbankhe has been filmed since birthhe lives in a town called seaveiw where every one is an actor each day he is filmed by 5000 every dayi liked this movie and the way it made you think about your life and is it realand would the perfect world really be so perfectjim carreys acting in this movie is a lot different than in the movie me myself  irene he was much more relaxed and dissent do any of his rubber face anticsone of the ideas that i think that the director wanted to get across is that the perfect world might not always be as perfect as you think it is by ariana mackay,black_comedy
in jim carrey plays truman truman is living in this fake world that is controlled by peoplean idea the the director is trying to get through is that not everything is as it seems truman soon discovers this ini liked because itwas different and original and also jim carrey played truman very wellcompared to other jim carrey movies he is more controlled in if you like different and funny moviesthen you will like,black_comedy
i think this movie was great as it hasnt been done before the turman shoe is a popular tv show around the world its about a man call truman burbank played by jim carreywho is living a pretty normal life well thats what he thinks but really there are 5000 cameras watching his every move some things and ideas i think the director was trying to get across were that a perfect life may not be so great after all as things dont changei enjoyed this movie more than other films jim carrey has done such as the mask and me myself and irean as in these movies jim carrey is very funny and in he is normal and seriousi would rate this movie 6 out of 10 tessa barnes ,black_comedy
in this movie jim carrey plays an average everyday guy named truman burbank he is married and lives a normal life what he doesnt know is its all a reality tv show and everyone else around him are actors until things start to become strange i think is a strange and interesting film which makes you think about reality tv shows this is also a very different sort of role for jim carrey to play instead of being out of control and crazy he plays a quite normal average joe trying to live an everyday life i think the director and writer were trying to show how interesting normal peoples lives can be if you enjoyed jim carrey in eternal sunshine of the spotless mind then you will probably enjoy him in this sensational movie,black_comedy
was recently shown on terrestrial tv in the uk bbc since it was shown ive watched it three or four times occasionally nodding off when tired but rewinding to catch the bits i missed its turning out to be one of my favourite films of all time  a true classic the ending is just brilliant  the script the music the bow the exit etc and ed harris really is superb in his rolei also love the way the show is only really introduced about halfway through when the interview is done then you get just enough perspective to really get in to whats going oni just cant put this down,black_comedy

truman burbanks jim carrey life is a tv show nothing about his idyllic small town is real but rather created for him to live in and he doesnt know about any of it because a cabal of slimy people have successfully kept him there his whole life until one day when he starts to get suspicious that theres something going onthe movie not only shows the corporation completely manipulating someones life but might also be interpreted as a metaphor for being a prisoner of tv ive never seen a peter weir movie that i didnt like and further backs that up this movie really deserved an oscar,black_comedy
i watched this movie with a friend when it came out in 1998 and we discussed it for days it is so multilayered that you can spend hours and hours discussing and dissecting it and still you may just have missed one important aspect of iton the surface it is a story of truman a 30 something guy who realizes one day that his whole life has been actually a tv show everybody around him including his wife and best friend are mere actors and everything around him is a studio set bizarre concept but not so bizarre if you think about all the reality shows these days the movie is kind of prophetic because it came out before the reality shows had not yet flooded our cable one can also interpret the movie from the way media creates manipulates and destroys personalities these daysjim carey has given an excellent performance but it is sad that it went unnoticed by the academy but they cant be blamed because he has become a prisoner of his own image so much so that no one takes him seriously had it been tom hanks instead of him i am sure this movie would have made a clean sweep that yearone of the most relevant movies of our times,black_comedy
i just got finish watching truman show for the first time really excellent consider that trumans world is the same as your mind you create your reality every day with the way you think your perception about things the programsscripts that you follow subconsciously and consciouslyhow many times have you found yourself doing something even though you know you shouldnt you think you are doing so with your free will are you yes if you always make rational choices but it isnt possible for a human being to make rational choices for the thousands of actions we take each day many are automatic further our emotions are largely subconscious and automatic think about people who are very emotional and how little control they have over themselves thus the term prisoner to your emotions to the extent your thoughts feelings and actions are automatic you are a prisoner in a world of your own makingconsider that we are all being controlled by others to some degreeother people other peoples thoughts other peoples patterns other scripts the media the government any time you allow yourself be led you are being controlled in the same way now this isnt always a bad thing and most of the time its a good thing consider what civilization has built with leadership medicine safety from anarchy space travel food shelter and grand buildings and so on consider too the horrific worlds which hitler pol pot stalin and too many others created will we let this happen again yes if we let our minds become imprisoned by a leader like them againat first i thought the premise of the movie was silly from a legal standpoint the tv truman show in the movie would be unconstitutional since it deprived truman of liberty i also thought it was implausible that an actor would commit a good portion of hisher life as with trumans wife just for a chance to be rich and famousbut waitwe know that the movie makes obvious statements about greed with the product promotion in the tv show and christofs goading over the shows ratings perhaps then the movie creators were suggesting that with intense lobbying by media companies congress could pass laws to make such a tv show possible depriving trumans liberty for his entire life scary thought but think about the results of lobbying in the real usa tax credits for suvs our governments position on global warming industrial mercury emissions poisoning our children how much influence does big business have right nowcopyright 2005 homegearcom all rights reserved,black_comedy
this is one of many movies that were prescribed to me by my shrink who believed in their effectiveness in therapy at first i could not understand the connection between a film and a psychological problem but then it became clear that both are about a fantasy almost everyone in society is living a fantasy that can be as far removed or as close to reality as the person wishes of course if the that person is a head of state dragging his country into war or running after utopian dreams then the harm done is that much more greaternow a film is also a fantasy but it is the very exact and deliberate fantasy of the director when we see a movie we are transported into that fantasy and we live it in vivid detail and color in all our visual and mental senses we also live it in our subconscious senses as well and herein lies its value seeing what has been thus far deeply embedded and intertwined inside us now on screen and out in the open helps begin the separation process between reality and fantasy since the distinction between the fantasy of the movie and your current reality is very clear and since you willingly entered the movie fantasy by your own choice until it overlapped with your inner similar fantasy you can get to experience the willful exiting of the movie fantasy that would subsequently help you to exit your inner fantasy in the future well its a little more complicated than that but this isnt the best place to discuss in deep psychotherapy techniquesof course im not suggesting that in and of its self a movie would cure anybody of anything that has to be the work of a professional and its his or her decision as to whether or not to incorporate it into the therapy process but i am curious as to whether anyone else has ever used this film or any other movie in this sense or at least experienced their psychological effect either consciously or subconsciously,black_comedy
there is one fantastic reason to see this movie it has broad audience appeal yet at the same it is very different from other movies and no one has ever recreated ityet truman played by jim carrey great acting but not really oscar quality material lives blissfully aware that he life is just a television program but his journey is to discover the truth about his life and attempt to escape the illusionaustralia director peter weir has often delved into the theme of isolation in the australian outback with picnic at hanging rock i went there but i was disappointed not to disappear on the ocean in dead calm in the mind with a post traumatic syndrome suffering plane crash survivor fearless and in an exotic community witness the amish in the big city and cop in the amish community both experience this often disappointing for people who love peter weir appears on the surface too light and fluffy but we find the same themes being repeated here does this movie reflect the relationship between god and humanity children and parents or government and societyyes to all the above however i feel the main theme is the relationship between the american people and the unreality of american tvtruman is trapped in a giant studio with an artificial sun and weather he cant escape because people try and stop him and his own fears fears that reflect how television and movies which appear on tv make viewers feel about the rest of the world most criticisms of this movie fail to see the truth behind the illusions the overly constructed world that truman lives in reflects the reality of tv but makes it harder for us to identify with truman and his personal despair this movie requires you to watch it with your brain turned and you must attempt to deconstruct this world something that is not common in a mass market appeal moviesometimes criticised for not being dark enough just because the lighting is bright and shiny and truman is a happy and wacky guy these people say it is not darkthey need a good slapping sometimes criticised for being too superficial that is the point that is what tv is like sometimes criticised for not keeping many of the incidental characters around long enough truman exists in a world where he is the only real person so it is a solo journey and only the shows producer who represents the world and not a person are part ofsometimes criticised for not showing trumans interaction with the real world i agree but that is a different movie and something done better many times over being there for examplewhat does it all mean my own take is this television is not trying to keep us down but challenging us to take on the adventure of life television doesnt want us to avoid reality but to go turn off the television and find the best and most exciting reality we can if you are not brave clever or good enough for the world dont blame televisioni would challenge those who didnt like it the first time to revisit it for those who havent seen it watch it dude there is nothing else like so you are either going to like it or notohand one advice for mr weirpeople who like arthouse movies are not really that intelligent next time use lots of spooky dark art noi lighting and they will like it too that was irony by the way,black_comedy
is about truman burbank who lives in a created world called seahaven everything is faked and controlled by the producer christof trumans life is broadcasted live in every detail by thousands of cameras until he is 30 years old he doesnt recognize that his whole life is a lie but after some time he gets suspicious and he tries to get out of his world jim carrey who plays the main character truman acts in a crazy way and gives the film a special funny touch which makes it even better in contrast to truman the other characters are acting more seriously which is an advantage for the film because if everyone acts in carrey8217s funny way  the film would have another effect to the viewer in making the film the director draw peoples8217 attention to the present problems caused by tv and reality shows,black_comedy
    in my opinion is a really unique film theres nothing to compare to it above all if you look at the message of the story the producer wants to show in an exaggerated way the influence of tv on our lives and makes clear how the media consumes us     therefore i would say that the story of was very original idea which film version isnt less good while watching the film the viewer identify more and more with truman and takes his feelings so that he hardly can wait for the happy end     ,black_comedy
in the name of god truman show  is about our life but not all of it that part which is hidden by ourselvestruman show is about the part of our life that is very and completely realthat part which we all have it but no bady isnt ready to show it to othersthe others that invole our mothers our fathers and our wife or husbandthat part which we like or love to be in that situationthe world of our ideals and our wishestruman show show this part and this is reason that i love it i live in iran and we cant go to cinema and watch the hollywood movie but i buy its dvd and watch it for 5 times and read its screen play for 2 times just in one week in the end of my commenti like to say that this movie is about the mankind life,black_comedy
if everyone has 15 minutes of fame then truman burbank has unfairly taken most of mine hes on tv 247 but i think its waste of time and i could do a better job if the bbc gave me a video camera i could make them a much better reality show thatd get top ratings theres this women only gym near one of the industrial estates and if i climb up some of the builders scaffolding i can film the women getting changeddo i get a response from the bbc about this idea do i hell i swear that nicole kidman must work in their post room or something people complain that there are not enough women running major companies but kidman couldnt even respond to one letter that i sent her not one so if shes typical of most women then its probably because they dont send back their job application forms stand up for yourselves and be counted women dont be like nicole kidmananyway the film stars jim carey as the hero of the story who doesnt realize hes being filmed some people say thats a bit far fetched but youd be surprised how easy it is to film people without them knowing truman lives this ideal life however deep down hes sad because he wants to do so much more he wants to travel and go places but hes afraid of water and lives on an island which is a bit dumb not as dumb as the brody family in the jaws films though oh man were they stupid they were like a bearded version of the brady bunch but with a much lower iq people watch all the time even when hes sleeping and hes quite a celebrity ignorant to the fact hes the most famous man on the planetluckily they couldnt secretly video me because i do stuff that makes baby jesus cry according to my mum who blamed it on the erotic witch project i dont make jesus cry that much though so thered still be time to check me out doing cool things like climbing over my neighbors fence and pretending to be dead thats always funny its really funny when i get up and pretend to be like one of the zombies in dawn of the dead and try to break into their house i normally only do it when the husband is away on business though as he doesnt laugh and scream hysterically like his wife does she mostly screams rather than laughs though but theyll be moving house soon so i guess ill have to stop doing it they only moved in 3 months ago which is a shame because i thought we were really getting along well and having a laugh the funniest time was when i hid in the boot of the wifes car that was really funnyas with filming people secretly in real life truman gets suspicious and starts trying to avoid the cameras he doesnt shriek or scream or call one of the shop assistants over to the changing rooms like people do in real life but instead tries to outsmart the whole production company which he does obviously that leads to the end of the whole tv series if i were watching his show id be like oh thank god thats over with that was such a dull program and providing that they didnt put snooker on instead id be happyi really dont like snooker its the worlds worst sportneonsamurai film rating for snooker code alpha foxtrot tango,black_comedy
the major factor in this is one of the best screenplays ive ever seen its a thing of beauty the way it progresses shifting gracefully through different levels of reality first we begin inside the show with opening credits like truman burbank as himself created by christoph along with interviews with cast members to establish the concept that truman burbank is naive to the fact that his entire environment is contrived by a television producer in the ultimate reality television experiment everything from the weather to the dialogue of the actors who play the people close to truman this terrific concept never loses its impact each time you see it it takes you on the journey again even considering the spate of actual reality tv that has invaded our homes since 1998 which this movie foretold or perhaps inspired this movie will always retain its appeal because its specific situation raising a baby in a realitytv environment and keeping them from knowing they are on tv and that they are fake in other words what reality tv strives for giving viewers genuine reality to watch in the person of truman is not likely to happen in real lifeeach moment is so beautifully rendered in cinematic language that film buffs the world over should feel like applauding it at every turn during a second viewing in particular take the scene where truman goes to the travel agent to book his trip to fiji we see truman standing in the agency with bags in hand and beachholiday clothes and the most precious musak plays in the background when he sits we see a poster on the wall behind him with a plane being struck by lightening and big letters this could happen to you so simply it conveys to us that they are going to try and stop truman travelling by plane as welland the muchpraised performance from carrey really holds the movie together hes got the tone just right for this movie which might be perfectly described as wry it has a fablelike quality each moment infused with humour yet we never lose sight of the eerie reality that this is a human being trapped in this situationthe full credit for achieving this delicate balance of tone goes to peter weir australian director of dead poets society gallipoli picnic at hanging rock witness mosquito coast and master and commanderis without a doubt one of the best movies of the 90s a rare perfect film 5 starsbest bit the two most famous scenes the stopping traffic scene and the incredible final scene,black_comedy
this is a movie thats fantastic to watch when you have no idea what its about you get the chance to see how long it takes for you to realise whats going ontruman carey is born into a world of 247 reality tv where he is the star all his friends and loved ones are actors and hes the only person that isnt in on it as reality tv becomes more and more outlandish you cant help wondering whether this will happen in the not too distant futureed harris is superb in the supporting role of the producerdirectorcreator of the show paradoxically he guards his privacy and is a very private person and has a number of memorable lines carey is also superb in the lead role and the ending must be one of the more uplifting moments of 90s cinema 910,black_comedy

its difficult to add new positive comments to i fully agree with the people who feel it has a strong script superb art direction beautiful music very interesting ideas in the plot extreme care in the details and yes jim carrey does a great performance as well as all the actorshowever it suffers a sad weak point i feel that the allegory of god through christof ed harris an allegory built not from the character name but from some events and scenes in the movie is very inappropriate its out of context it happens just as a gag it would be right if the movie portrayed christof as someone who believes to be a god which he does however the movie does an effort going an step beyond using some typical christianlike imagery to establish the allegoric parallelism looking like a gods caricature rather than christofsis a great movie one of the best made movies ive seen in the last decade despite its inappropriate allegoriesi voted it 710,black_comedy
spoilers hereincould have been very very good in fact it would have been excellent if the entire movie had not been spent on trumans trying to escape if hed escaped halfway through the movie and spent the rest of the time adjusting to the real world it would have been much more interesting unless created with a sequel in mind this film is poorly done hats off to jim carrey for his first drama 410,black_comedy
i liked this movie but was left with the feeling that it could be so much betterthe concept was a great original idea but so much more could have been done with itfor me there was definately something missing,black_comedy
jim carrey dropped his trademark mugging and played it straight in this superb satire when strange things start to happen truman burbankcarrey begins to suspect that hes perfect life in the perfect american town is not what it seems in fact he is the unwitting star of a worldfamous tv show and his entire life has been manipulated what will he do when he eventually discovers that hes every move has been filmed by hidden cameras and watched by people all over the world touching thoughtfull and funny this is a very special film that works on lots of different levels and was nominated for 3 oscars also starring ed harris,black_comedy
it that the film is not long enough  rarely something to complain about nonetheless needed two extra scenes to first demonstrate the climax of jim carreys character at his momentous  discovery and then the catalyst to transform  other than this the film is perfectly delightful  high praise indeed from one of jim carreys biggest nonfans  something original from hollywood and well in advance of the reality show craze is definitely a rarity,black_comedy
is a fresh and thought provoking comedy with some excellent acting directing and scripting its a very simple concept and is a bit slow to start off but after the first fifteen minutes it reaches a climax and continues on that note for the rest of the movie the acting is great all across the board jim carreys best film to date the films humour flows naturally and the drama is very gripping indeed is one of those few films that doesnt rely on special effects and a huge budget to be a great film 81 out of 10,black_comedy
this films very underrated  reminds me of harvey a favourite of carrys if im not wrong the film effortless juggles between satire and poignancy with a great and somewhat quite fantastical premise there was always the chance the film would not be delivered to its full potential but credit to weir he has constructed one the standout american films of the nineties one which deserves more recognition than it already recieves from within those stuckup critical circles the film is not the most in depth around by measure of symbolism and other such what nots but this is preferred since it is thankfully devoid of the sort of seriousness and pretension that these elitist critics often hold in such high regard films shouldnt have to be bergman or fellini to be considered great greatness comes in other forms not just in charting human nature etc although its certainly essential to have a wide variety as with all things in life similarities to hitchcock then in that its glorious entertainment fused with subtle humour and intelligence and brought into fruition with great aplomb this is a film which will linger in your mind long after you leave the theatre carreys performance is great famously billed as his first great serious performance i was not too convinced on first viewing since he plays it a bit tongue in cheek at times but on further viewings his performance and that of the cast is now recognised by this individual as extremely understated in its brilliance  complementing the tone of the film perfectly as it elicits subtle laughs as well as more touching moments of poignancy complemented by a breathtaking musical scoretruman is certainly one of the most likeably characters since mr george bailey himself and that in itself is a feat achieved by the dramatically moving and nailbaiting denouement you too will be cheering truman on plus he gets the girlrecommended with extreme conviction,black_comedy
i have bought this movie because it was costing to much to hire it out all of the time why watch it and find out the film is great the acting is great but the soundtrack is the best i have heard in a long time someone once told me that philip glass wrote string crp after watching or even just listening to this film i assure you that you will also disagree with this statement the soundtrack matches the films action perfectly and even sounds good without the film to see how this film did not win any oscars mystifies me i cant remember watching a film which asks so many questions about humanity the world we live in and most of all ourselves may be this film should be rereleased again so that it gets the credit it truly deserves watch this film ps jim stop all that ace venture stuff there is certainly a gap for you in the more serious film genres,black_comedy
of course you could do the same as most other people do describe this movie as a satirical and sometimes hilarious comment on the role of the modern media  or something of the kind but you would do wrong if you left it like this it contains many more truths than just thatthere are two opposing concepts of life which stand out one is firmly anchored in the shores of protection it means that you do not feel any inclination to venture out into the unknown for you are happy where you are and by no means you want to alter the present state of things for such people the town called seahaven would be the ideal one it is a haven against the dangerous outside world here represented by the sea a place where you can feel absolutely safebut man throughout his history has always shown his discontent with staying at home and just maintaining the knowledge passed on to him by his ancestors he has always felt a desperate craving for new experience explorers like magellan who was the first man to surround the earth stand for such endeavouring energies truman burbank although his position as a life insurance salesman might let you presume the exact opposite is a wouldbe explorer himself and worships men like magellan when he tells his friend marlon that he wants to leave his secure desk job and go to fiji he also mentions that there are still islands in fiji where no human being has ever set foot his aim is to see something of the unknown world add new dimensions to his lifebut trumans plan is counteracted by the requirements of the show in which he is the unsuspecting hero by no means is he allowed to become aware of his true condition therefore all his attempts to leave seahaven must inevitably fail it is as if his life is guided by invisible strings held together by the godlike christof it is only by a superhuman effort that he manages to set himself free surmounting the fear of the element that he dreads most water by undertaking an unlikely escape voyage across the ocean that strikes the tvprogram bosses by surprise he finally gets to the boundaries of the world that meant reality to himnow he has finally achieved what he always wanted to find the exit door of seahaven and there is nobody who can stop him he resists the entreaties of his creator christof and boldly advances into the land beyond the iron curtainof course we might be tempted to regard this scene as a metaphor for the passing of the ultimate threshold of human existence from the land of the living to the land of the dead that view seems coherent but only if you exclude death as the end of the line for what truman has in mind is clearly continuity he is carrying the identikit picture of sylvia the woman he once lost and always hoped to find in fiji and refers to it as his map thus his innate discoverers energy is enhanced by the power of love and it is this explosive combination that finally smoothes the way for his escape from the protected slavery into the realm of infinite freedom,black_comedy
although the current rating might be relatively high for imdb considering its in the top 250 it still deserves betterthis is by far my favorite jc film  somehow i didnt know the plot before i saw it so it began as mysteriously for me as it would have for carreys charactercame out before the survivor craze and the slew of other reality themed shows that fill our tvs today and makes an exaggerated yet realistic portrayal of the genremost will enjoy this even if you are not a carrey fan or are expecting something of the usual carrey caliber ex liar liar  it proves he has more depth as an actor than i initially thought,black_comedy
brilliant and imaginative this movie is like no other so long as family or friends havent ruined the end for you id highly recommend it bonus  its suitable for families equally suitable for a boys night in even those who dont like jim carreys past silly roles will revel in it,black_comedy
it seems lost on people that stems from platosphilosophy mainly book eight of the republic brilliant references forexample truman finds truth when he meets laurelsylia tricked man findstruth in nature peter weir is a thoughtful director coaching abrilliant performance out of jim carrey who can do drama as well ascomedy the movie is vague but not because of lack of thought a greatfilm and touching beautiful soundtrack i would have loved to speakwith the art director sets and design are great a definate 10 all of,black_comedy
i have just watched this fabulous film on video for about the twentieth time and i am smilingwhy because this is a film that says wherever there is an individual there is hopejim carrey should have won something for this film because he is outstanding as trumanit does not surprise me at all that this film was completely ignored by the motion picture academy awards after all there is an intelligence at work here that the movers and shakers of hollywood just would not understandin 1967 in the uk we had a tv series called the prisonerthat was the forerunner ofin its time it was villified and sanctified in equal measurebecause public opinion forced the tv networks to broadcast this series without explanation or apology for nearly forty years the argument has raged as to what the hell this programme was all aboutnow if can do have the same effectthen it has done its jobsee this movie at all costs and think about itthis is not a jim carrey comedybut it might save you from drowning in a sea of apathy,black_comedy
about 5 years i meet jim carrey in sandestin fl while the movie truman show was shooting in okaloosa county where i use to live he signed an autograph in my 9596 yearbook ads he signed it on the picture that shows himself from the movie ace ventura but also he didnt allow a picture taken after the movie was done shooting in sandestin while i was working at the video store here in okaloosa county and i started renting this movie on video and i goofed up on this movie like mr carrey started being a goofy guy making his fans laugh at him that was the first time i got an autograph from an actor,black_comedy
i dont care how many times ive seen this movie i can still find something to enjoy in it at least 20 times later it still moves me and excites me just as much as it did the first time which to me makes it one of the best movies ever madejim carrey sheds his hyperactive manic personality that has earned him so much money to play the straight man and conjures up a believable and endearing character as truman carrey brings a feeling of wideeyed innocence to the role and effortlessly portrays trumans realization that the world around him is all a farcewith enough imagination wonder humor and emotion for five movies is a brilliant somewhat overlooked masterpiece that can easily hold its own against many classic movies in my mind it already is one,black_comedy
i liked truman show although in some weird sense it made me feel quite uncomfortable at times only truman and his true love sylvia deserve to be called human beings in this story the actors producers and the audience are the true puppets here i sympathize with trumans search for truth but in the end i can feel only pity for him knowing that he had to live almost an entire artificial life anyway despite the uncomfortable feeling and despite the lack of humanity of the audience who can live only through trumans life this is by the way the most shocking part of the movie which most accurately represents reality particularly now with all those reality shows out there i thought it was very good the end was particularly satisfactory and well stitched the final scene with the guards was very symbolic trumans true drama even with a happy conclusion had been planned to be just another big fiction and ends exactly like that just another massconsumption show among so many a very strong message under the skin of what i suppose can be seen by some insensitive souls as a superficial justforfun fiction,black_comedy
i had to analyse this film for english at uni and it was amazing to see the depth of themes and characterisations peter weir has taken on many subjects to portray reality tv shows commerce christian allegories etcbut he handles this excellently and leaves it up to the audience to decide their own views my favourite two scenes are when trumans father is reintroduced and the event is orchestrated by christof and also at the end when truman is sailing and hits the edge of the studio the acting was top notch in particular jim carrey laura linney and ed harris performances were stunning i must also mention the music it captured the moods perfectly in short is a brilliant film i cant recommend it enough and yes jim was robbed at the oscars ,black_comedy
it makes me feel so good to see that this film is in imdbs top 250 films this film completely deserves it  jim carrey is one of the best actors of this generation and i hope he continues to make excellent films like this one  usually im not one to like films with a deeper meaning but i really like this film because it gives you so much to think about and makes for an interesting story  at first i thought this film was absolutely improbable but after watching for my 3rd or 4th time i dont think its all that absurd extremely unlikely but not completely impossibledirector peter weir did a fantastic job with this film and this is probably one of his best films  the cast was excellent throughout the film  ed harris was just as great as always  laura linney was superb as meryl also i think natascha mcelhone and noah emmerich deserve some special notice for their work  the rest of the supporting cast was good as well paul giamatti harry shearer philip baker hall and everyone elseif you like jim carrey then you really ought to see this film  be aware that this film is more of a dramatic comedy as opposed to his complete zany comedy films made prior to this one  i really hope that you do give this film a chance and i hope even more that you enjoy it as much as i do thanks for readingchris,black_comedy
i just watched this film again after visiting seaside in pensacola florida where some of the scenes were filmed i was mainly looking to see if i could recognize any of the scenery but was reminded at how good this movie really isjim carreys performance in this movie was really terrific and although there were a few scenes that featured his trademark silly face routine many other scenes demonstrated what a fine actor he really is one scene in particular that stands out in my mind is towards the end when he begins to realize the true scope of his situation  the editing of the scene hides his face throughout and the viewer can still feel his paintruly a great film that rightly deserves to be in the imdb top 250 and its sad that carrey didnt at least get an oscar nomination for his work,black_comedy
jim carrey is becoming one of todays best actors proves that he plays truman burbank an ordinary man who thinks that he lives an ordinary life he actually is a twentyfour hour tv show that has been going on ever since he was born truman does not live in the world he actually lives in an enourmas dome shaped building he also doesnt know about how everybody around him is an actor his moms an actor his best friend is and actor even his wife is an actor but he is not an actor he starts to become suspicious about his life when his radio goes haywire and he hears a voice commenting on his every move as the movie goes on he becomes more and more suspicious about his life the acting is sensational the music is beautiful and the story line is clever if you want to see jim carrey be dramatic and funny youve got to see this even if you dont really like jim carrey all that much youll absolutely love this movie12 out of ,black_comedy
great movie ed harris and jim carrey turn in great performances personally i cant see anyone hating this movie although it does drag on with some scenesanyhow810,black_comedy
i feel that the degrading review on the page for this film is disgusting this film is a tremendous achievement with governmental undertones to rival the matrix and one flew over the cuckoos nest in my opinion i think that the film is trying to tell us that whatever we do wherever we are we are all in some way being watched by someone or something we arent as free as people tell us and there are boundaries all around us just like trumans world truman is told what to do who to be and where to go through the people around him to make good television just like the public are told the same things through the media and through government i think if you look closer than the exterior of this film the viewer can find a much more interesting concept than just a story of a guy stuck in a tv show,black_comedy
ive never been a great fan of jim carrey but i liked this it was new it was interesting and in todays reality tv driven world this film needed to be madejim carrey was excellent as truman and the supporting cast was very strong especially ed harris as the benevolent christof carrey showed great potential he reminded me of another goof ball comedian robin williams who has become one of the most versatile actors in cinema today carrey made a great move with this film and this marked the start of a more diverse career for him with appearances in simon birch and the man in the moonid like to see more of this kind of movie from carrey i really connected with trumans desire for freedom from expectation and duty the film touched me and moved me in such a profound way its themes are so deep that its like diving into a sea when you watch this film as with all great films you can watch this a hundred times and still enjoy it for the remarkably interesting and insightful piece of cinema that it is,black_comedy
this would be a good film to talk about in a philosophy class as it raises many interesting philosophical questions the performance by jim carrey is exceptional and it shows that he has a range beyond physical comedy the highlight of the film is the oscar nominated performance of ed harris,black_comedy
should be of interest today because its author has just opened simone starring al pacino which will surely be one of the top ten films of 2002stars jim carrey in arguably his best role you may recall the oscar snub that year when carrey failed even to get a nomination after he won the golden globe for the same role  carrey sans the silly faces and jerry lewis antics plays this very seriously and is brilliant  serious followup roles in man in the moon and majestic have proved that carrey has the chops to be a serious actor  hopefully hollywood will stop typing him and the world will start accepting him for his more serious worktruman also stars the terribly under used laura linney who made such a wonderful splash with the indie you can count on mebriefly is a futuristic soap opera in which its star truman thinks his life is real  he was born on tv and has lived his whole life there on camera  the town in which he lives and all of the people who populate it are sets and actors hired to fill in his life  how he discovers the truth and the manner in which the network tries to prevent that is what the film is all aboutif you have never seen and especially if you have enjoyed simone it should be on the top of your must rent list,black_comedy
jims greatest film is dumb and dumberit cracks me up every time i watch it but is one of his best its got a good cast and interesting idea and while therere many plotholes we can avoid this by just having fun at the movies 355 starsjohn ulmer,black_comedy
i had an absence of serious movie viewing for about 6 years and this is the first movie that i saw after that period and i thought it would be worthy of my first imdb review  jim carrey though he has great talent as an impressionist has not faired greatly in the movies  but this movie is a shining exception  it evokes the echoes of network making us think about the television intensive world we live in  it predicts the proliferation of reality tv shows  and better yet it is a great time at the movies  you care about truman  you want to break out like truman  you want your life to have meaning like truman does  you want to tell the world that you are as mad as hll and you arent going to take the mediocrity that the tv spoon feeds every day to you  you feel a little more joyful and courageous about life because of the last 2 hours that you spent in the theater  is what the best movies are all about  helping us to see something we need to see in a better light  what a great movie,black_comedy
amazing story interesting tense mild funny parts this movie is really perfect you just cant say anything bad about it it starts out happy and fun then its tense and then its a feel good movie if your a big jim fan you will love all his movies just because of jim but this movie shows he can be a great drama actor as well as one of the best comedians out there bravo jim this ones a favoritetagged as buy it first and watch it with close friends,black_comedy
confirming jim carrey as an actor not just a comedian and placing the most mediaquestioning punch of alltime in its face this film delivers thought provoking emotion and comedy all in onethe thought which should stay with you in the end is the media probably will do this one day  isnt that wrong  can it be stopped  and perhaps is it me,black_comedy
one of truly classic movies all too relevent today great acting and fake acting at that great music great set few flaws a great shame that carey did not get an oscar nomination what were they thinking a shame,black_comedy
one of the very very best films ever wrote i was impressed by jim carrey that i only knew through the maskquite different here and ed harris is perfect as always well if you havent already seen it just run to get it ,black_comedy
is an almost perfect example of filmmaking at its best  the performances especially of funnyman jim carrey are astounding and the plot is amazing  is the story of a man who lives in a perfect world  he soon realizes that this world is actually a painstakingly crafted set for a tv show inwhich he is the star  the film draws you in so much that the line begins to blur are you the viewer of a simple film or one of the vouyers watching trumans life  that is where the director really gets you  watching this movie in a postsurvivor world makes a realityshow lover writhe in their chair as it paints a picture of the people who watch this show,black_comedy
i loved the movie from start to finish great acting especially jim carey good story line with a good twist once you understand it its extremley enjoyable to watch910,black_comedy
when i watched this film for the first time i was amazed how it left me feeling when i left the cinemawhen i heard about the film i didnt expect it to be overly brilliant due to the nature of carreys films but he pulled this off leaving the audience wondering if carrey was actually truman the film allows him to be funny but while keeping a sincerity about it meaning we are desperate to find out what happensthe directing is incredible in this film spy cameras are used very effictively meaning we feel as though we are watching as a real programme on tv and not as a filmi left the cinema feeling the same as i did when i first watched the great escape this is a feeling of sadness and hoping that something like this will never happen again except with we have to remind ourselves one thing it is only a film,black_comedy
from that point on truman burbank jim carrey realizes that something is different in his life hes got a beautiful wife good friends a good job and seems very happy but something is wrong and he cant put a finger on it until one day he sees his thoughttobedead father and things start falling into place his life is one big tv show from birth truman was adopted by a company for the express purpose of televising his life from the day he was born to the day he would die truman burbank is a tv star even if he doesnt know itthis movie is all about jim carrey the big talk was how he signed for 13 million a pay cut from his normal 20 million salary so he could do a more serious film could he pull it off and im here to tell you not only did he pull it off its an award winning performance anytime the audience feels so strongly for a character on screen the actor has done his job and in this movie i felt like i was a part of truman hes a sweet loveably guy who was put into a situation without permission nothing in his life is real from his marriage to his friends to the guy selling him his newspaper every day and carrey makes you feel sad for him but he gives truman a heroic quality that makes you cheer for him to break free from the ties that bind the story itself was unlike one i had ever seen before one man ed harris controlled an entire city from the sun rise to crossing the street everything was timed perfectly and billions of people each day sat and watched the life of truman burbank i read that jim carrey felt was like his own life in that everything he does is seen by millions of people and sometimes you just need to be left alone im glad he chose to do this movie because maybe now people will understand him a little better  it was just a shame that he didnt win the academy award for best actor i mean he didnt even get nominated  what a shame  thank you mr carrey because of this film you have shown the world that you are not just a rubberface comedian,black_comedy
i found this film stangethis story is impossible but interestingat the beginning i like this film but when trumans starts understanding whats going on he is becoming tensei dont like this extractthat sort of programme doesnt appeal to mefor understand the story we must we have to be hookeed by the film,black_comedy
i was emotionally scarred by how bad jim carrey was in the mask ace ventura wasnt much better and i barely made it through the grinch who stole christmas i just dont like the jerry lewis slapstick humor but this film totally different because it show the bad things of the reality show,black_comedy
i think this movie is goodit show how tv practise to have the audience ratingat some time the film is boring and i think that this sort of trash tv is impossible to realisenoi dont think its a good thing to use a person to make money,black_comedy
i was sitting on a bus once and two people in front of me where discussing movies one asked if the other had seen lire lire and the second said that they had not seen it and that they would not because jim carrey cant acti almost shouted at her asking if she had seenit is one of the most moving films i have ever seen up there with empire of the sun much better than the still good edtvplease i beg you dont right off jim carrey until youve seen,black_comedy
after leaving the cinema i have three ways of ranking a film i cant stop talking about it i want a refund or what the hell was that all abouthad me thinking what was that all about  i saw it again on sky and really enjoyed the experience this time maybe because i was alone and had more time to think or maybe because i was a little olderi dont knowim not a huge fan of jim carey but i have to admit his acting in this film was outstanding and ed harris was perfect at the end i was starting to crack i believed he thought of truman as a sonin all a great film but you need to fully engrose yourself in it to get the most out of itmy rating 910,black_comedy
im a jim carrey fan and i was expecting this movie to be funnier i think it had a good story but it seemed long to me,black_comedy
i went to this movie wanting jim cary to impress me and let me tell you he did in spades i  only hope that this is not a one time departure jim carey did a phenomenal job of course having a fantastic director like  peter weir does not hurt weir does a wonderful job of using his actors in ways that surprises you holland taylor does a great job as a woman who loves her son even though she is just actinglaura linney is incredible was the long suffering actress that must play trumans wife and noah emmerich does a wonderful job as trumans best friend when in reality he is trumans worst enemy this movie is truly disturbing because in this media driven world that we live in it is not that big a stretch of the imagination that the networks would try something like this or that we would all watch it whether we admitted it or not i recommend this movie highly if you are looking for a jim caery style comedy this movie is not for you if you want to see jim carey in one of his finest role you must see this movie,black_comedy
the most original film ive seen in years its unique funny and moving carrey and harris are terrific as are the rest of the cast highly recommended to anyone who wants to actually think while watching a movie,black_comedy
what a great life truman has do you wonder how many times truman has almost drowned always differently of course according to the script for that episode im not a movie critic obviously i dont like to review movies i like to talk about movies without injecting a great deal of scholarship into the discussion i have lots of education an mba and everything but some of these plots in new films are quite interesting who hasnt had experiences time that mirror some of these plots i myself have tried my hand at various occupations like trumans i have been an insurance agent and a real estate agent all of us who have worked at these things know that fellow that gives truman the seasickness all of us no longer able to even eek any more but theres is prosperity everywhere the people are happy the media is not complaining about anything theyre all too busy with the presidential scandals i guess i wonder where sylvia will take truman may she is going to take him to school where theyll be happier in some sort bohemian limbo not noticing their squalor truman is a bit old for it i  dont think hell be happy i like hollywood movies better than ever sometimes but one has to wonder if the public understands them i guess the public has no choice but to accept and tolerate i wonder how many trumans there are how could truman become a member of the tavern maybe all he needs to do is pick up a mild alcoholism habit well at least is nice to know that the people at the tavern speak up for truman poor truman do you think mr birbank sr was also an actor before he became a hobo that is did he join the people at the tavern or not well if you havent seen you are missing out on a much better movie than titanic,black_comedy
clever engaging story about a naive young man named truman burbank whowithout any knowledge of the factlives in a controlled artificial environment and has his entire life broadcast as a television show by a mercurial producer harris when truman becomes suspicious of the faade complications ensue for the cast and crew to try and keep the show running an odd but remarkable and fascinating story effectively brought to life by a surprising performance from carreyabandoning his comic rootsand a superb supporting cast unfocused at times but always interesting and utterly believable lots of high points in this one of a kind story but the ending doesnt have quite the impact it needs to make it a direct hit ,black_comedy
this is probably one of the best script and movie i have ever read and seen the idea is so different from other movies that i have ever seenthe casting is perfect with jim carrey as truman burbank the guy whom the world is watching throughout his life the guy who live among actors who pretended to be his mom dad wife best friend etc after a long years he started to notices something wrong and this is the story of his great escape to real world andrew niccol new zealnder writer have done a great job this is gonna be the best black comedy movie anyone have ever seen i highly recommended that everyone should watch this movie  i gave it 910 for this movieok to prove that this is one of the best movie read thisone of the most spectacularly original american movies in yearsdavid thomson esquirea gemlike picture crafted with rare and immaculate precisiontodd mccarthy varietya satire of orwellian proportionscleverly conceived masterfully executedwith a knowing script by andrew niccol that evokes the caustic wit of paddy chayesfky  michael rechtshaffen hollywood reporter,black_comedy
can we talk can we really talki was emotionally scarred by the badness of jim carreys the mask dumb and dumber wasnt much better and i barely made it through the grinch who stole christmas i just dont like the jerry lewis style idiot humorbut is totally different it is really a drama although there are comedy bits and its original wellacted and interesting im an action movie buff and i get bored readily by dramas but this one is interesting in a way reminiscent of the old tv series the prisoner but not as pointless and while theres a fair chunk of arty the film was accessible to me not one of the elitewho would like this film    drama fans even if you hate jim carrey films normally    types like me who can appreciate a drama if its intelligent not too slow and not too arty this ones safedont see it as a comedy its not reallyill give a big relief vote of 9 out of 10,black_comedy
this movie is wonderfully orchestrated  the artificial world of truman the people the placesalmost everything even the acting is superb i think ed harris has done an outstanding job as someone mentioned his character could have risked looking ridiculous in the hands of some other actor however obnoxious it may have been built to be harris actually humanizes it to such an extent that in the end his relationship to truman is almost paternal and we feel sorry that hes losing him jim carey i felt over did his part in some scenes but hes superb in the scene were he reaches the horizon of his artificial world and touches the blue wall thats there instead of the open air his horror of encountering a dead end of being trapped of not being in the real world of nature comes across brilliantly in this scene this movie brings together two of the most beautiful actresses both laura linneyexcellent in blindspot among other movies and natasha mcelhonesurviving picasso do their parts really well  what i was left with after watching this movie is a sense of now what will happen to truman ok hes escaped from his artificial world and hes going to be with the woman he loves but really it cannot be that hunky dory the movie almost ends with an unsaid unwritten and they lived happily ever after note even if truman has escaped the controlled world can he really lead a normal existence in the real world in which hes such a huge celebrity being a celebrity constantly under the public glare and mediahounding is almost as bad as being 247 tv feature the only consolation to this is the thought that probably he doesnt really enter the real world at all may be he escapes to some parallel universe called fiji,black_comedy
one word sums up this movie for me fresh  it is so original  i have never seen a movie like this before or anything close to it  there is nothing better than being able to view a fresh script after 100 years of movies the plot also has very few holes in it  i mean whats to stop something like this from happening it is very realistic thats why i still wonder why scifi is considered at one of the genres of this film  this film also got me thinking like everyone else that saw it hey maybe my whole life has been a tv show  anyway all in all it was a very enjoyable film,black_comedy
possible spoilershow they did it i do not know but is practically perfect from the opening credits where the members of the cast discuss their roles to that unforgettable scene where truman walks across the horizon to the very end not telling go see it it captures you  jim carrey is wonderful and ed harris is perfect and i love all the special camera angles from unlikely places ie trumans rearview mirror and peoples buttons the amputation scene in the hospital the scene where truman stops the traffic wow and the love scene between truman and sylvia are all totally captivating  in fact the more i remember it the more things i know ill never forgetwhat are you gonna do grate me slice me or dice me  there are sooo many choices or how about the lines of villagers marching through the town searching for truman  who could forget cue the sun  or the scene where truman is reunited with his father with appropriate musical score lighting and camera work for the viewers benefit  what about the womens magazines and the badge with how is it going to end on it  or the posters on the wall of the flight centrea great achievement of the movie is that it made you think  in fact you cant ignore it  as well as going around for a week thinking youre on candid camera youll find yourself wondering more and more about truman what happened to him  did he and sylvia find each other  how did they manage to build such a large set in the first place  was the marriage to his wife legal  did she audition did she get time off  why did marlons parents let him act in ever since he was small  how did they make him keep it secret  did he even know right from the beginning did trumans mother really love him  what if a tornado had knocked down the set  did truman have a chance to learn religious education  did they ever make it rain on the day of the school picnic  what technique of discipline did his mother use as an example to the world and did it work you know that kind of thingthe scariest part of however is that the movie is very nearly coming true  watch it and youll never be able to watch temptation island or flatmates or big brother again unless you are absolutely beneath contempt of course,black_comedy
warning spoilers ahead for me is as close to a perfect movie as you are likely to get not only it provides you with abundant food for thought but also it is beautiful to see and very very entertaining it goes beyond the simple speculation about the value of privacy and the lack of ethics in the entertainment business but it leads to ponder about weightier things for instance the matter of a sheltered but not very interesting life vs a life of adventure with nothing guaranteed also the reason why utopias dont work christof thinks that a world that resembles a fifties movie is the perfect world whereas trumans dream is to explore some south pacific island never visited by man and of course the quest for truth vs a beautiful lie in his obstinate search for the true world truman understands that truths beauty surpasses any lie no matter how shiny or cozythe movie is full of visual beauty especially towards the end when the perfect world starts to unravel with trumans flight the magrittesque images of the moonasaspotlight the boat ramming the sky and truman walking on water to a staircase apparently suspended above the horizon are the kind of thing that you just cant forgetjim carrey plays a perfect truman innocent but also determined in fact it is hard to imagine another actor playing this role ed harris is also perfect truly frightening in a role that would have looked ridiculous in the hands of a lesser actor laura linney as trumans dimplecheeked wife plays very well the sinister side of her characterof course everyone is free to dislike this movie but there are some things id like to say about the negative comments to begin with lots of people wondered about the possibility of anyone wanting to see a tv program like this the only thing i have to say about this is that im surprised at how fast only within a couple of years this objection has become irrelevant the other objection was about the movies allegedly happy ending i dont think the ending is happy truman and sylvia disappear both through dark doorways and although we are free to imagine that they will eventually be together and happy living in fidji we dont know if this is really what will happen but this is the point isnt it not to know hows it going to end,black_comedy
peter weir is a wonderfully talented director who differs from most with his wonderful use of symbolism but with he steps up and delivers i could go on and on about the performances and the directoral talent and the intelligent symbols and the strong none preachymessage but ill just say this what a wonderful film its a gem,black_comedy
i could thoroughly comment upon this film as i liked it very much being one of my favourites of course i would praise it instead i only have one cue for i dont want to bore anyone life itself is neither better nor worse than in the film it is only a race against time a fight with the unknown not a trully american classic at all in reality an unusual prospect of life more or less were all puppets on a stage and dont know who or what is pulling the stringsa very misunderstood underated movie,black_comedy
i have seen about 5 times  the first three times were in theaters  i really didnt mean to see it three times it just happened  the first time i went to see it i saw it cause it looked interesting  the second time was mearly an accident because my friend said he had something planned to do and that was go see truman show  so i endured a second viewing  the third time was another very long story that i wont even get into  the 5 times ive seen this movie i enjoyed it every time  jim carey really is an actor  i was amazed at how unike the story was  no story i had ever seen had come up with an original plot idea like this one  laura linney was great as jims wife  ed harris also did well as an insane creator of  this movie all together had something  it had a sort of feelgood yet sad yet sometimes funny attitude  the film breathed ideas  could a person really live in a place like this  the movie demonstrated how corrupt network executives could be  ed harris almost tried to kill carey  overall i think this movie is definetly going to be a classic810,black_comedy
trumans life becomes the most watched tv show around the world the only moral dilemma is that truman does not know about it he has been sold to the corporation from birth where he has been used and abused as a tool for product placement frightening as it may seem this is occurring today under the disguise of television entertainment run by million dollar corporations what tells us is nothing new but reminding us not to become brainwashed victims,black_comedy
when i saw peter weirs film on its release i was so engaged by jim carreys wonderful performance as truman burbank that i regarded the film overall as positive and lifeenhancing seeing it again three years later i find it a much bleaker experience ed harris as director christof is such a megalomaniac manipulator that he has perhaps drawn attention away from everybody else involved in the conspiracy against truman from the merest technician to the actors playing his best friend marlon noah emmerich and his wife meryl laura linney but not only are the production team and players involved in the conspiracy but so are the millions of viewers of the show so while we may applaud trumans brave decision to enter the real world we should be clear that he will find it full of voyeurs of low intellect and even lower moral standards who for 30 years have been willing to be entertained by spying on him and depriving him of a real life some people might think that the films satire is too severe but i think it is fully justified day after day tv puts out programs every bit as inane and manipulative as that depicted in the film it might be argued that unlike truman the participants in confession tv and such programs as big brother are volunteers and know exactly what they are getting into but in a sense they do not since most of them are unaware of the ridiculous and unattractive sides of their characters which they will reveal to the cameras and which are the real point of these programsstands comparison with george orwells nineteen eightyfour as a satirical polemic against totalitarian interference in peoples lives  but the threat now comes as much from the media as from government,black_comedy
this movie is probably most memorable for showing that jim carrey can actually act i basically hated him in every other movie mostly in dumb and dumber the mask and the cable guy in this movie however he plays remarkably restrained and he actually shows emotions way to go jimthe rest of the movie is basically very entertaining there are a lot of interesting touches such as trumans wife constantly doing advertisements for all kinds of rubbish at the worst possible times and the reactions of the people viewing the show the idea behind the movie raises some interesting issues on privacy and on exactly what the media should be allowed to although these issues could have been investigated a little further when you really start to think about it however the movie just doesnt add up the idea of a tv studio the size of a small island and a man not knowing that hes in it are just a little too much to swallow especially when you realize that nobody on the island can do anything at all i mean is it that hard to actually hire a bus driver or a ferry captian instead of an actor  its really a shame that this movie isnt as convincing as it could have been but other then that its very entertaining out of ,black_comedy
jim carrey is to what james stewart is to its a wonderful life  completely indispensable carreys great performance as truman a man predestined to be an eternal innocent and denied the full knowledge of how his circumstances came to be makes this film in spite of an overthetop twilight zone style plot this film has more to say about the human condition and is far superior than good will hunting which aspires to the loftier heights of realismthe cruel director played by ed harris is not a million miles away from the socalled flyonthewall documentary directors who manipulate real people and pepper our screens with tedious victim based documentaries which claim to be great social insights carreys portrayal of the innocent truman has great pathos and a touching quality in being denied the truth about his real existence truman is unknowingly imprisoned in a childlike existence that he has never had the opportunity to shape for himselfcarreys brilliant performance wins the audiences sympathy when he finds out the reality of his constructed existence and tries to break free from this cruel manipulation and tyranny what makes this film stand out today is that it is one of the few films of recent times based around the theme of personal liberty when there is so much false theorising in the real world about what constitutes liberty and we are being told that fewer liberties is a new consequence of fighting a war for civilisation it is refreshing to watch a film that is funny entertaining and wholly sympathetic to the idea of personal freedom,black_comedy
saw this on tv last night  quite a relevant issue is dealt with satireand wits here that is the exploitation of privacy in the name ofmedia entertainmenta white males life from birth is documented live 247 the veryindividual not being aware of it  the plot starts when this mantruman starts suspecting his surroundings  the production team ledby christof is determined to make every move of truman an entertainmentmaterial while truman seeks for the truth and of course the gullablelosers are yet again the viewers of the showjim carry is rightfully praised for his convincing performance in thisfilm i mock oscar who failed to recognize this performance  edharris as always brought life to this film as well  on the one handhe christof is the arrogant villain who creates and produces thistruman show but on the other hand he brings out quite convincinglythe parental element in relation to truman as his father who raisedhim all along with utmost careandrew niccol as imdb information will tell us has written yetanother script for a film gattaca the previous year  as was the casethen here again he tackles a very important and relevant issue inmodern society and poses quite a few important questions  but alasas was the case then here again he does not seem to have any answersof his own  so disappointing  i must say i have little expectationfor his next project simone 2002  it seems he is now going to wasteal pacinos talent as wellpeter weir who also directed witness 1985 and dead poet society1989 yet again expresses his humanitarian viewpoint  if you weretouched by these films you may find not only to be asatire but  also to be a moving drama  if you thought that his otherfilms were emotionally overdone you might feel that this one likewiseis a bit cheesyif you truly felt for truman and yet enjoyed big brother series i sayyou learned little from this film  does the word hypocrite apply toyou,black_comedy
is probably the only decent movie jim carrey has made as far as i am concerned i have been pretty embarrassed by any movie starring him so far but this one blew me away how great is his acting here the movies premise was some years before the whole and appalling by the way big brothersurvivor phenomenon with a lot of taste and witunlike many other films manages to build a disturbing atmosphere because you dont quite know whats coming next the special effects are awesome especially when he and his boat reached the wall in his getawayoverall amazingly good and an accurate description of what would be like a persons mundane life being the plotline of a tv series810,black_comedy
i just watched for the first time in about two years wow what a great movie its funny symbolic exciting and philosophical just an all around great effort from all concerned it ranks as one of my most favorite movies,black_comedy
this is one of the best movies ive seen in a long time its very well thought out and jim carrey is suprisingly good as truman i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes intelligent entertainment,black_comedy
i should preface my comments by saying that i prefer old movies that i am stuck in the past and hardly ever enjoy a movie made after 1975 one of the reasons being that recent movies seem to include their own rave reviews so much money is at stake that a movie becomes the equivalent of columbuss voyage this movie is flawed on several counts there are at least three or four twilight zone episodes based on the concept of someone unknowingly living an artificial life the twilight zone tv show has everything that this film lacks artistry conciseness originality bite and that gorgeous black and white with plenty of shadows is a oneidea onegag movie moreover the whole notion that artificiality is bad is flawed we are all artificial knowingly and unknowingly we all play roles all the time thus to deplore artificiality amounts to deploring life itself if truman doesnt know his life is artificial that makes it nonartificial doesnt it,black_comedy
this movie is weird but interesting and i doubt anyone would say it was the same old  i havent seen any other movie like it  after the initial humor and laughs i felt sorry for the poor guy truman trapped in the makebelieve world  some of it is just crazy but at least it keeps your attention pretty much all the way through though i think it does get a little tiresome towards the end  the movie is creative though unrealistic and has quite a few funny moments  definitely not my favorite moviebut its unique ,black_comedy
bizarre black comedy about a life lived from birth in front of a camera very good show highly unusual and well worth the price of admission has to be one of the oddest films ive ever seen carey gives his usual great performance  as did all the other players,black_comedy
this is one of the worst films i have ever seen in my life i wasted money on renting this filmi usually enjoy jim carrey films hes a great comic but this left me cold i havent seen it again since the day i first saw it and i dont intend to ever againone of the reasons as to why i disliked this film is because i dont have a clue as to what was going on this is why i have avoided the film edtv as i expect to be the same as this dull and confusingsorry 2 out of 10,black_comedy
first off a logical individual knows the whole premise of could never happen just like being john malkovich could never happen a world entirely encased in a very large dome with a large lake and even sunrise sunset and weather  so we must look for a deeper meaning to this film to me it is a restatement of the old saw it is better to be free and risk the perils of life than to be confined and protected in an artificial world  hmmm  maybe that applies to wild animals too  maybe we should abolish zoos carreys character truman as a 30yrold adult whose life has been a live tv show 247 for 30 years it started with one camera but now there are over 5000 in trumans world he begins to suspect his world is not real that all the friends and aquaintances are actors that his whole life is just a tv show this is revealed fairly early in the film and the rest of the film we watch the development of his understanding of his situation and eventually his plan to escape or die trying  just like the chickens in the more recent film chicken runa renegade actor tells him it is all a fake he studies an old photo of his wedding and sees his wifes fingers are crossed  he changes his daily routine and sees a fake elevator in one building he begins to notice that the same people cars and bicycles simply go around the blocks and repeat a funny scene which you can only appreciate if youve been in a film as a cast member or extra the directors tell all the people in the street first positions everyone and they all hold their positions waiting for actionin an interview with the reclusive christo ed harris he explains that truman was one of 5 unwanted babies due to be born and he was selected because his birth was at the right time nothing else he had a pretend dad who later pretended to drown as a way to make truman scared of water and hopefully prevent his exploring too widely  was it cruel for a corporation to adopt this baby then use him for a show christos pov was that truman had a much better life this way the film is very well done and carrey does some of his best work here in a serious role the preise is fascinating and the way it is depicted remains very interesting all the way to the end i rate it a very strong 8 of 10,black_comedy
maybe the biggest mistake of the makers of was bringing the film in the theatres almost at the same time ed tv was playing or was going to play this is no ed tv but i think many people actually think that is more interesting and especially genius in style maybe the best part of the film is that the viewer actually feels with the character also its one of the most original movies i have seen in years the way the story unfolds is wonderful to see i will not tell you how the story goes because then i will say things that uncover already basic elements of the movie you just have to see it for yourself jim carrey is amazing to watch and ed harris is his usually self that means brilliant without stealing the show that part is for carrey and he doesnt use his gags or funny faces to amuse us enjoy a interesting and magnificent experience a movie with high standards to amuse every age,black_comedy
is a movie about a man who lives his everyday life without knowing that his life is only a tv showhis wife his friends and all the people in town are just actorsthe hole town is fakethere are hidden cameras everywhere that are shooting trumans life all the timetruman has lived for thirty years like that but then he becomes suspiciousjim carrey does a great job as trumanthis is a very different role for mr carreythe movie won a few oscar prizes which is not surprisingis an amazing movie,black_comedy
i must have been the only person to watch not knowing what was going on at the beginning  at any rate the movie became more and more disturbing as it progressed  i had thought that by getting a jim carrey film i would have picked up a comedy  boy was i wrong  this film just like the cable guy is seriously disturbing  i guess if you are rating carreys acting it would be a 10 he has remarkable flexibility as an actor  i was rating the entertainment value of the movie however and was unprepared for how disturbing and frightening the experience would be,black_comedy
a hackneyed and corny film this script plagarizes the far superior and original scripts of serlings classic twilight zone episodes also similar theme in several star trek episodes to those of us familiar with real sf this effort comesoff as shallow and tepid for virtual world adventures go rent the matrix or a goodie but oldie westworldwant thrills the game is for youcerebral challenge the 13th floor is an oft overlooked little gem,black_comedy
i admit i was prejudiced against jim carrey when i walked into the cinema i had never been able to watch a whole movie with him playing in it however i had hopes knowing that peter weir witness the mosquito cost dead poet society etc directed the film i also heard praises about the filmwell i watched this film all the way and actually i had fun during the second half of it the ideas were really promising and  the film had some moments but the first part soap was far too long people do not go to a cinema to watch daytime tv it lacked acting too the characters were playing soap actors and there is not much fun to watching that and jim carrey who supposed to be the real person in the show was no different from them sorry this guy just cannot form a character because he is a bad actor weir should have noticed it since he had directed actors like harrison ford and robin williams before carreys performance really hurt the film no wonder the moment ed harris who did a great job realising the allmighty producer of the show started to dominate the film it got much better but on the whole this film belongs to the group of movies you can write a lot about because of the ideas behind them but you dont want to see them for the second time in filmmaking it is fine to have great ideas and be able to talk about them but if when you have to go out you cannot make them really work then you missed the point,black_comedy
jim carreys first attempt at drama has rewarded him with the golden globe and other awards but why is this the film is boring and not really that interesting at all i gave it a real chance though and tried not to be judgemental because i wanted to like it but it did fall short of being a good inventive movie i thought jim carrey was good and so was ed harris and laura linney who was really good in her role despite the good acting however the film didnt quite reach my expectations and considerably fell short of being as excellent as everyone has been saying,black_comedy
when adam and eve has gone on earth it was a fall or a escape for it was it is an escape every man long for what he hasnt both an apple or a normal real life swapping it with the paradise is the story of the truman search of the knowledge and of the true despite the risk the fear the creator  and  the happinessis a hollywood story told us with not too much shouted humour thanks to a new great jim carrey and a touch of class due to a great ed arris almost anyone else is notable,black_comedy
i cant believe all the user comments on this movie and they liked it they should be shot i couldnt believe i wasted my money on this piece of st and to whoever thinks that this is better than saving private ryan should go to rehab and here is 10 reasons why this movie sucked 1 theres no point to this 2 its a waste of money 3 youll fall asleep easily 4 wasnt funny 5 jim carrey doesnt fit in 6 its a story that doesnt make any sense at all 7 youll wish the movie screen would just burn 8 it would make you leave in two seconds 9 dumb and dumber 2 is going to be better than this 10 even jim carrey himself probably couldnt believe he did this,black_comedy

rarely can film satire make you laugh and be worried about the future at the same time levinsons film does just that with a great cast and great writing this film succeedsyou may have noticed that many of the posts and reviews argue that this is not plausible obviously these posters do not realize that satire is supposed to be over the top and show what can happen in extremes and ironically this came out just after clintons sex scandal and is still relevant today with george w and will continue to be regardless of the president also some may think it oversimplifies the public as idiots but this isnt true especially if they are being deceived and information is withheld there are some implausibilities as in why no reporters went to albania or how other countries didnt get involved other than denying the charges but these are small and even addressed in scenes with the rival candidates news reporters and even cia head william h macyreally i dont know how anyone can not like this film since it is smart funny and scary all at once with fine performances and direction all around this is an american political satire classic that is sadly becoming less satire as time goes onoverall 910 buy or at least rent before the satire becomes reality,black_comedy
barry levinsons underrated is a brilliant piece of satire which is to the 1990s what all the presidents men was to the 1970s the president is in trouble after a sexual scandal with an underaged girl enter robert deniro and anne heche who want to distract the nation with something else as they try to get their boss out of the hot seat the only problem is nothing is going on so it is up to them to create something to rally the country around the executiveinchief now enter sleazy but high class hollywood director dustin hoffman in a welldeserved oscarnominated turn who is contacted to start an imaginary war he agrees and the plan works but as time goes by more and more problems occur and the lies continue to snowball levinsons excellent direction and hilary henkins clever screenplay raise the performances of all involved naturally deniro and hoffman are guaranteed to excel in a film like this but good work is also done by people like heche denis leary william h macy woody harrelson and even willie nelson  somewhat ignored in 1997 but still one of the best films of that year and one of the more important films of the 1990s 45 out of 5 stars,black_comedy
i saw this before the brouhaha with clinton and lewinsky broke and i imagine most of the negative comments about this film came because they saw it after and thought this was a nostradamus film  when i saw it i thought it started a bit slow and was a bit too selfsatisfied like the scenes of people crying at a concert that seemed fake  however for most of the way this is sharp biting and yes funny though when i first saw it i thought it was more accurate in its hollywood satire than on its government satire  time of course proved me wrongdavid mamet will never be universally loved because not only does there seem to be a large group that doesnt get him but that thinks those of us that like him are degenerates  myself i happen to think hes one of the best playwrights and screenwriters working today though im split so far on his novels  his writing may be highly stylized but i guess im in tune to the rhythms of his dialogue  and he doesnt assume his audience is dumb rather he seeks to challenge them by asking you to come to your own conclusions rather than hit you over the head  and he does that very well in this movie at the beginning we may think conrad brean and stanley motss are real sleazebags but at the end while we deplore the action they take of faking a war just for political ends we cant quite dismiss them eitherof course a lot of that has to do with the performances of robert deniro and dustin hoffman anne heche is also a standout as winnifred ames the increasingly bemused presidential aide  deniro seems at first like a teddy bear here with his beard his hat and his bow tie but he transfers the energy associated with his more volatile roles taxi driver raging bull goodfellas et al to guile and street smarts here  the way his eyes probe whoever hes talking to and the way he anticipates almost every verbal comeback the other person has demonstrates thathe cant anticipate every event of course but once he gets used to it he canbut the standout here is hoffman  theres been a lot of comment on hoffman basing his character on robert evans  my own theory is he read lynda obsts excellent book hello he lied which talks about the producers role and simply played that  i formed that theory because of his mantra whenever things go wrong this is nothing especially when winnifred reads him the riot act after their plane crashes  theres a part in the book where obst talks about having to argue budget with the studio and realizes its all a game where they have roles to play she argues for more money the studio for less  just as winnifreds role is to be pessimistic and stanleys is to be optimistic  and hoffman never condescends to stanley instead showing a talented maybe amoral guy who deep down is so insecure that he values credit even over his lifef my life i want the credit is one of the best lines of the film  contrary to his line this film is not nothing,black_comedy
during the campaign to reelect the president of america an underage sex scandal between a girl scout and the president in the oval office  to divert attention spin doctor conrad brean is called in to manage the fall out and hold it off for the 11 days till the election  conrad employs hollywood producer stanley motss to produce a war in albania to divert the media away from the real storythis was made before clinton was accused of misconduct with monica lewinsky and the subsequent restart of military action in iraq  this seemed to give it a much greater feel of realism and much more credibility  however even before this happened it was still a very sharp and very good satire on political spin but also managing to have a dig at hollywood movie types the story is told in a very stageplay fashion and is dialogue driven with very funny moments throughout  its not as terrifying as a real look at media manipulation could be because it chooses to be a comedy instead but it still makes plenty of valid pointsthe two leads are excellent at the head of an allstar cast  de niro manages to be a professorstyle character while at the same time having an easily accessible sense of menace just beneath the surface  hoffman is good sending up hollywood producers well and drawing parallels between the creation of a film and the creation of political news stories  the cast also has a series of cameos and extended cameos who add both humour and quality to the film  willie nelson denis leary james belsuhi william h macy etcrecently in the uk weve had huge problems with spin doctors running the labour government  to the extent that 11th september was described as good by one as it gave them the chance to bury several bad news stories that they had stored up  and more recently with various governments waging a media war to win support their stance regarding military action  this film doesnt make hugely serious points but it does make you think about how the media is used to shape public perception and make us think what those in charge want us to thinkoverall a very funny very clever satire that has a great cast the only criticism being that it stretches its point a little too far with the old shoe section,black_comedy
i do not understand the people who did not like the movie for me this is the greatest political satire since chaplins the great dictator both de niro and hoffman are great as well this movie is not about clinton although they did predict correctly the kosovo war and albanian terrorists it is about american political system which is made by and for tv several lines from that movie why albania  why not albania does not rhyme what do you remember about the gulf war one smart bomb i was in that building when we shot that shot and many more are impossible to forget because everyday political life does not let us forget them,black_comedy
can a movie created in the late 90s still speak to a voting audience in the late 2000s prior to my answer would be no but watching and now rewatching it for a second time in the past week this film could be watched today watched next year or even watched prior to the next four elections and it would continue to feel current real and modern in todays politicalcinematical world the power of the dialogue the intense chemistry of the characters and the constant interruption of the television generation into the political world will continue to keep out of the black hole of cinema  it will not be dated never forgotten and forever enjoyed as we continue to allow cnn to give us our news this film will remain as vivid as americas apple pieact i the chemistry of the characters robert deniro and dustin hoffman could play chess for three hours and it would capture my attention from beginning to end deniro is a powerhouse of an actor not just because he can play the tough gangster type but also because he can take a character like brean and give us simple verbose and intelligent his range can be seen throughout this film he commands each scene that he is in focusing our attention on each of his words and lingering on his next move in my eyes it is more powerful than goodfellas or casino because of his subtle nature the scene that stands out for me in that requires viewing for deniros talent is that between cia agent william h macy and deniro discussing the honesty of the war on albania to me this shows the power of his talentjumping onto the other side of this film there is dustin hoffman while deniro pulls his obvious strengths with this film hoffman makes more than just a political film listening to the commentary hoffman discusses the fact that he nearly didnt make this film because he couldnt find motsss character thankfully he did due to his compelling portrayal we are taken from political conspiracy cinema to this raw human drama the final act was sublime due to both deniro and hoffmans chemistry but also because we believed motss words as audience members we wanted to see him tell his story knowing that he never would it was the human element the motss true self that we were drawn to and hoffman stayed true to those moments until the very end this isnt your typical hollywood happy film this basis itself on  albeit conspiracies  but honest conspiracies could you survive the greatest hoax ever and promise not to tell a soul surrounding these characters we had willie nelson denis leary anne heche kirsten dunst william h macy john michael higgins and  who could forget  woody harrelson these are our players and they take us from scene to scene with the greatest of easeact ii the writing  the directing david mamet does anything else need to be said having been a full time follower of his work i was not surprised to see that it was his quickwitted words coming from our characters mouths it is the fastpaced level of intellectual banter that transforms into the powerhouse that it is it works because you finish watching the characters actions and it is the words you find yourself quoting for weeks after mamets political punch to this film was reminiscent of kubricks ideas behind dr strangelove the two were films that were absurd but it was also the ideals that they were satirizing that makes both viewable today just as powerful as they were when they were released mamets words with barry levinsons direction takes into perfection there are no heroes there are no villains and we know so little about the characters that it is simply the story or the words that pull us into this film the beats are hit the angles are crisp and tight and our characters are perfection  possibly the best casting in years with this in mind we have only the third act remaining  cause as everyone knows  there is always a third act act iii the final thoughtoverall is perfect very few films in my eyes fully carry the honor of being watchable at any time any decade or any political year  but does watching with a group of friends i was surprised as to how many had not seen this feature remembering that it had been birthed nearly 11 years ago it still seemed surprising overturns those political conspiracy theories and makes you laugh think and realize the impact of our commercial media it was enjoyable to hear the current terms like plumber and commercial president in this 1997 film boasting the truth that this film was made before its time looking back there are those that could complain about our premise being too clich that the same conspiracy theories have been done again and again but to me this was fresh this entire film was fastpaced amazingly acted and media driven in the commentary it is talked about how it is rumored that the media doesnt even check sources any further and this is a glowing example of that regimegrade  out of ,black_comedy
it had been a while since i last watched this film but i once again remembered the reasons why i loved it so thoughtful and evocative this film really captured the nature of politics and spin doctoring this certainly ranks as one of the best political comedies of all time the overthetop attitude of the film didnt detract from anything making this still quite believable it also demonstrated how peoples emotions can be manipulated when aggressively attacked the fragile nature of the human spirit tends to make us more susceptible to such manipulations as demonstrated in this film with the exception of anne heche everyones performance in this film was rather good the only other downside was mark knopflers score which was completely out of place in this film,black_comedy
this is a thoroughly enjoyable movie the story is probably familiar so ill just summarize it the president of the usa gets caught having sex with a teenage firefly girl and deniro and heche hire dustin hoffman an old hollywood hand to produce a distracting event like a war with albania to flood the media and distract the publics attention for long enough 11 days for the president to be reelectedone thing after another goes wrong and each time hoffman comes up with yet another colorful lie to extend the life of the story the cia publicly ends the war prematurely no problem this is nothing cries hoffman you ought to try shooting the four horsemen of the apocalypse when two of the four horseman die two weeks after the beginning of principal photography no war no problem hoffman invents a hero who was left behind in an albanian prison camp every war has a hero the man chosen to be the hero  woody harrelson  turns out to have spent the last twelve years in a military prison for raping a nun lies are piled upon lieswe all know that political spin is put on everything that happens in washington this movie came out in 1997 during clintons presidency but he never started a war to deflect criticism and yet the way levinson has directed it and the way the performers attack their roles it is almost completely believable that deceptions like this take place hoffman stretches his acting a bit but he is never so hammy that he is unbelievable as a hollywood producer ramon bring me my veggie shake now and they told me i couldnt make moby dick from the point of view of the whale he brings to the part some of the smoothtalking duplicity that he showed in papillon and midnight cowboy he glows with self satisfaction as he spells out his accomplishments to deniro this is the greatest thing ive ever done bringing this war to a satisfactory conclusion deniro but there was no war hoffman that makes it all the more difficult nobody else is in the least bit over the top they play it the way levinson directs it as a realistic straightforward story none of the actors seems to know that he or she is in a comedy and it works very welli dont think ill mention any more of the gags because i dont want to spoil it but its hard to forget the scene near the end of the film when hoffman is looking out the window at the funeral of harrelsons character huge american flags the casket being carried by the men of the 303 invented for the occasion hoffman spreads his arms expansively and says to deniro  look at it the whole thing is a  fraud and yet its 100 percent honest a victim of his own egotism hoffman decides that he wants credit for the production and is perfunctorily disposed of having suffered a massive heart attack poolside this was probably a funnier movie when it first appeared president clinton and monica lewinsky and linda tripp and all that a war built on a string of lies seemed so outrageous that it was impossible to take a movie like this seriously well circumstances change the movie is still a great success but my heart sank at the sight of the flagdraped coffin returning from albania the story seems equally outrageous now but in a very different sense of the word,black_comedy
is a brilliant satire of the american political system with enough realism to make it plausible it speaks the strongest to people who already have a visceral loathing of the american democratic process not how it was in 1789 but how it is now they see a degraded and ignorant public easily duped by politicians who are no more than habitual liars who will say anything to get elected but lack any idealism whatsoever intelligent funny but also very depressing 910,black_comedy
hollywood is sometimes able to produce satirical films that in retrospect appear to predict future developments in american politics being there the story of a simple man whose homespun philosophy is taken for profound wisdom and who as a result becomes a candidate for president may look like a satire on the reagan administration but in fact it was actually released in 1979 during the carter years dave which features a womanising president called bill whose marriage is in trouble because of his adulterous relationships and his trimming of his radical principles came out in 1993 just after bill clinton had taken office it must however have been planned well in advance and was presumably not actually intended as anticlinton satire but that is how it tends to come across todayis another film that proves to have been unintentionally prophetic shortly before an election the president is embroiled in a potentially explosive sex scandal which threatens to end his presidency in disgrace in order to distract the publics attention his advisers concoct a wholly fictitious military crisis in the balkans and hire a hollywood producer to provide the necessary harrowing footage of war scenes when the albanian government protest that their country is not in fact at war the aides present this as a triumph of american diplomacy that has averted the threatened crisis and in order to keep the affair in the publics mind concoct a further subplot involving a supposed military hero in real life a convicted rapist in a military prison held prisoner by a rebel factionall of this may seem very familiar but bear in mind that this film was made in 1997 two years before president clinton faced with a potentially explosive sex scandal which for a time threatened to end his presidency in disgrace took america to war over a crisis in the balkans at least he didnt need to concoct a fictitious war the parallels with the more recent iraq war are perhaps less exact although the scenes involving the supposed hero old shoe were strongly reminiscent of the ballyhoo surrounding private jessica lynchlike being there is not of course a work of social realism in real life a simpleton like chance could not become president without being found out and no administration could actually get away with inventing a bogus war thats why they have to provide real ones  in order to make a satirical point both films exaggerate prevalent tendencies in modern political life being there among other things is about selfdeception chance never pretends to be anything he is not but those around him deceive themselves by seeing him as what they want him to be on the other hand is about political spin and the deliberate deception of the public politicians try and deceive as many of the people for as much of the time as they think they can get away with and the media will go along with such deception for as long as it is in their interesthas some sharp points to make and there is a very good performance from dustin hoffman as the hollywood producer stanley motss motss is recognisably suffering from status anxiety in its most acute form the form that afflicts the brilliantly successful and wealthy man who still feels undervalued by society and will do anything however unethical or even dangerous to his own safety to win public recognition he complains that there is no academy award specifically for producers ignoring the fact that one is not needed because the producer traditionally receives the best picture awarddespite that however i felt that the film as a whole was not as sharp or as funny as it could have been i think the reason is that it is basically a onejoke film once the war story has been exploded the plot tends to lose direction the idea of concocting a wholly bogus war is a brilliantly surreal satirical conceit the idea of concocting a bogus hostage drama although more inherently plausible lacks the same inventiveness so the old shoe scenes come as something of an anticlimax after what has gone before i felt that robert de niro as the presidential aide conrad brean was less effective than hoffman i have never thought that comedy is his forte and that he is at his best in serious roles i may be judging unfairly as there are several of his comedies that i have not seen i also felt that it was a mistake not to show the president in the film this may not be a realistic film but the idea that a spin doctor could create a fictitious war without even the president being aware of what is going on strains credibility past its limits moreover as we found out with nixon and his attempted coverup of the watergate affair the culture of spin involves our elected leaders themselves not just members of their staff overall the film had its moments but could have been better 610,black_comedy
as the calibre of the talent involved would suggest is a very well acted and directed film however for some strange reason it isnt a particularly satisfying oneperhaps that is mainly due to the fact that it is somewhat of a one joke idea or maybe its due to the fact that with current events as they are its all too plausible and the whole thing of late is somewhat comically overexposed whatever it may be in the end you cant help but feeling that the film somehow missed a beat somewhere along the line and ultimately wasnt all that it should or could have beenthat is not to say that this isnt an entertaining film it is from the fistful of great performances from robert deniro anne heche denis leary willie nelson woody harrelson and especially dustin hoffman who seems to be relishing his role here to the well played supporting roles filled out by the likes of william h macy craig t nelson kirsten dunst et al has all the talent performing admirably it also has a sharp amusing script by hilary henkin  david mamet based on the novel american hero by larry beinhart going for it and barry levinsons direction is top notch but despite being quite entertaining it also seems too slight by half and just not focused or funny enough to quite make everything work successfully at the end of the day regardless of its flaws is still a fun well made and entertaining film that deserves to be seen and enjoyed it just isnt quite able to reach the lofty peak that it aspires to but just so long as you dont go in expecting an hilarious rib tickler of political satire its a pretty fair bet that you will be suitably entertainedone mans opinion 7510,black_comedy
scariest thing about is that it has a very realistic feel sure there are some far fetched things but overall the movie leaves the impression like this is something that could actually happen in real life or already maybe has happenedbut is more entertaining than anything yes in a way you can compare it to dr strangelove or how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb even though it is not as brilliant of course the subject is treated in a very entertaining and comical way and that is what makes a very fun movie to watch but yet it also knows how to bring over the important political message of the movie in that way this movie is comparable to dr strangelove or how i learned to stop worrying and love the bombthe main cast is very good robert de niro and dustin hoffman are great in their second movie together sleepers was the first which was also directed by barry levinson and they can now be seen together again in meet the fockers it sounds weird but they really have some chemistry together anne heche however at times irritated me and also isnt exactly the most talented actress ive seen there also is a very good and entertaining supporting cast with actors such as willie nelson william h macy woody harrelson a still very young kirsten dunst and craig t nelson in a uncredited role as enemy senator john neal really entertaining are all of the woody harrelson sequences they are highly fun and might very well be the best parts of the moviea very fun entertaining movie with a realistic feel highly recommendable810httpbobafett1138blogspotcom,black_comedy

barry levinson has always been a director that yanks the rug out from under his audience when they least expect it he starts his films off with a knowing grin that sets a playful tone and then the trap snaps and schit gets real in ways we didnt see coming he never loses the lighthearted tone to his work though and even when things get decidedly grim theres always a winking light at the end of the tunnel that somewhat restores the airy note we rode in on walks this tightrope terrifically a buoyant political satire with dark flourishes in all the right places but a piece that knows its place and when to pull up its britches and pad its daring dark ending in surreal mannerisms that make it easier to swallow when the us president is caught up in a torrid sex scandal spin doctor conrad brean robert de niro is brought in to fix the situation using any means he can his brilliant idea involves utterly fabricating a war with albania in order to smother the affair and distract the american people using a shameless smokescreen the scary thing is and not just for the film but the sad state of affairs in the states these days even that it works splendidly using the help of of eccentric hollywoood producer stanley mottss dustin hoffman spacey songwriter johnny dean willie nelson spiffy fad king denis leary and head honcho politico anne heche brean concocts an entirely false and unnecessary conflict just to facilitate the whims of their commander in chief this is another film that eerily predicted the internet atrocities of the future which plague us today in a world filled with laughable lunacy like kony 2012 je suis paris and bring back our girls one begins to wonder what kind of unseen cogs spin to dictate what we filter our profile pictures through and gab about nonsensically on a monthly basis to distract us from whatever is really happening behind the scenes when you take into account that this was made in 1997 it becomes all the more apparent thats its a film with quite the head on its shoulders hoffman really steals the show as the bronzed up coiffed motor mouth of a tycoon so deliriously dumb that he unknowingly stumbles into answers to is own obvious musings half the time this is nothing piece of cake de niro is a sly fox deliciously underplaying brean and getting us to lay our guard down sothat we dont see the danger in his persona until its already dictating choices that we make theres also fine work from woody harrelson kirsten dunst william h macy harland williams this one really deserves more acclaim than its remembered for and will make you think almost as hard as youre laughing b,black_comedy
i personally dont like the news all news just takes stories and negatively embellishes the heck out of them somewhat supports my theory but it really shows how the news can fake things just to make themselves look good although the movie is about the news its very concept can apply to all forms of mass mediais a political satire its whole point is to show how manipulative media is and how gullible the public is barry levinson has a knack for making feelgood movies so theres nothing too outrageous the movie is about the president of the us who has sexual misconduct with an underage girl and breaks into the public two weeks before election we never do see or hear him excellent move by barry levinson de niro plays a spin doctor who is determined to make the president look like a hero by creating a fictitious war with albania why albania albania is a very tiny country who many people have not heard of de niro gets a hollywood producer hoffman to help create the war by using fake stories and fake footage the public buys it all while watching this keep in mind that the movie is a satire kirsten dunst is an actress who plays an albanian victim in a battleground in the phony newsreel wouldnt her parents think that girl looks exactly like my daughter wouldnt headlines break about albanias proof of denial of the whole war as a satire no the movies main focus is to make you laugh sure it is unrealistic but that is where my mention of gullibility ties in the stories are convincing the footage looks real as can be it is the biggest story in the country so why not believe it the movie puts everything in perspective by having a wild crew make every little thing convincingmake a top 10 list of hoffman and de niro performances and movies would appear on all of them hoffman was nominated for an oscar for his role as a smoothsailing flamboyant producer de niro who i found to be just as good as hoffman plays a cocky spin doctor who is very admirable both guys are very funny it is also funny to see just how realistic and possible is whos to say fakeness isnt used to cover things up this was released one month before the clintonlewinsky scandal anybody that knows that scandal could see the connection between that and this movieif i could change anything in this film i would increase the clarity from albanias side and add more to the news footage other than that the movie is very real and gets you thinking what is real and what is fake how smart are we354,black_comedy
people may think of as fiction but time and again the movie has shown itself to be reality whether it was bush sr coming up with the gulf war to distract people from the savings and loans scandal clinton threatening military action against iraq to distract people from the lewinsky thing bush jr invading iraq as a wecantfindosama diversion or the current threats against iran this movie is the hilarious but unfortunate truththe plot of course has spin doctor conrad brean robert deniro teaming up with hollywood producer stanley motss dustin hoffman to fabricate a war so as to distract the country from the presidents sexual follies and to think that the movie came out around the same time as youknowwhat it just goes to show that truth really is stranger than fiction especially when politics is involved a great satire also starring anne heche willie nelson kirsten dunst and woody harrelson,black_comedy
writers hilary henkin david mamet  director barry levinson deserve an ovation to attempt a film like an outstanding work of cinema a washington spin doctor who mere days before a presidential election distracts the electorate from a sex scandal by hiring a hollywood film producer to construct a fake war with albania an incredible idea turned into an incredible film levinson has made many many masterpieces before but this 1997 classic ranks as his finest work to date his understanding to the subject  his brilliant execution leaves you awestruck a film where minuses are hard to findperformance wise dustin hoffman is fantastic hes a treat to watch in each  every scene he appears every dialog he delivers is a treat to watch each  every expression he conveys is a treat to watch this is his strongest performance to date robert de niro is excellent as always anne heche is superb and she looks really sexy in that shorthaircut woody harrelson is firstrate as the rapist others are perfect in their partson the whole is cinema at its best two big thumbs up,black_comedy
courtesy of barry levinson right before the clinton scandal long before the war in iraq comes an essential part of the explanation for each media is biased more by the five oclock deadline than it is by politics but politics influence media and vice versa in a very close way thus comes an essential dark comedy from the 90s that analyzes the ways in which glamor building and a little interpretive spin can change americarobert de niro plays one of his finest roles as conrad brean a spindoctor who has eleven days to keep the country distracted from a sex scandal so that his president can get reelected he joins up with hollywood producer stanley motss dustin hoffman and creates a war crisis averted but how long can they hold on an important aspect to this is the lack of general compliance in the conspiracy theory dark meetings are held under the capital but the cia arent informed the president is fully knowing of the buildup but becomes a primadonna performer too distracted with theatrics to play ball reporters are subjected to the power of suggestion but are willing to demand answers toothis movie shares thematic and stylistic connections with levinsons latest film with de niro what just happened but i think will stand the test of time much better oh and did i mention that its hilarious i almost forgotdeep belly laughs throughoutpolarisdib,black_comedy
right from the opening scene moves fast the audience must be in shape to follow the actors from scene to scene fast talking and fast walking the film moves from city to city limo to jet and studio to studio the movie doesnt slow down until its final scene when nothing happens very political is all you can truly say about anyone who believes in conspiracy theories has as one of their top ten favorite films de niro and hoffman are terrific together hoffman does his best robert evans impression as the fast talking fast moving hollywood producer that can solve any problem,black_comedy
1997 dir barry levinson  cast dustin hoffman robert de niro anne heche woody harrelson kirsten dunst brilliant comedy about manipulation starring dustin hoffman as a filmmaker approached by robert de niro and anne heche to make a film involving the presidents conduct with a young female the media will be their audience and the news will be their advertising they stage a fake war in albania and even present a phony war hero this is all done to boost an election that was suppose to happen eight days earlier ending is questionable but structure is clever resulting in one of barry levinsons best films he previously made other such clever media outings as rain man and good morning vietnam here he toys with the nature of media interfering in news and exploiting it in a method that draws higher ratings in this case it also works politically hoffman delivers a brilliant performance as a filmmaker out to outdo himself de niro and heche are flawless in their quest for diversion this is questionable but presented with great touches of humour woody harrelson plays the drunken phony war hero who is oblivious to everything around him kirsten dunst is also featured as an orphan in a fake footage sequence to fool the masses and provide more amusement ambitious film about media illusions that gives new meaning to creative art score 9  10,black_comedy
for my money is one of the sharpest satires in recent memory the idea of a manufactured war to distract from scandal  this movie drags it to the limits of absurdity it is astonishing how far spin doctor de niro and producer hoffman take this deceit the two stars make a great screen pair hell with the exception of anne heche ugh anne heche its wholly a pretty great castif youre shaking your head in disbelief when the final credits roll the movie did its job beautifully it does paint a pretty disparaging picture of the american public but thats nothing this is some well puttogether stuff810,black_comedy
this 1997 film is billed as a comedy drama a closer look reveals it to be a clever satire as well and something of a tragedy the tragedy is in the seemingly soso attitude of conrad brean robert deniro at the end with the elimination of stanley motss dustin hoffman the satire is everywhere in the film  from the realm of politics to the makebelieve world of hollywood and film making to the news media the satire cleverly begs the viewer to ask some serious questions as a society have we become as hohum about life and death as this film and others show we have have we become so arbitrary  at least in some quarters  about truth and justice if anyone doubts the intended satire of this film just look at the promo of the film and the cover of the dvd they read a comedy about truth justice and other special effects the plot in a nutshell begins 11 days before a presidential election top white house staff with private help create a bogus war with many other phony side distractions all this is to divert press coverage and public attention away from the accusation by a young girl that the president sexually abused her during a white house event the movie is wellscripted and directed its full of action and has the audience guessing what next and wondering at the guile of the two main antiheroes played by deniro and hoffman all the performances are very good and i think dustin hoffmans was excellent it ranks up there with the best of his roles  maybe even better than his oscar wins in rain man and kramer vs kramer so 1997 must have been one of those years when extraordinary politics may have been at work i discount sentimentalism because the best actor award that year went to jack nicholson for his role in as good as it gets i dont mean to besmirch him but can anyone ever think of nicholson in terms of sentimentalism nicholson did give a good performance as melvin udall but two other nominees had far superior performances in much more challenging roles robert duvall in the apostle and dustin hoffman in i think hoffman should have won that year for his wonderful job in once one gets by the hollywoodadded over abundance of crude language this film is very entertaining yes it is funny in many places and its a real close look at the gullibility of people in many quarters its a nice satire on politics the press and even the general public,black_comedy
its very close to perfect ten but i wont dwell on the reasons ive got this one rated 95 rather than 10 i simply want to point out the aspect that most people forget when referring to this movie everybody notices the wit of the script everybody notices the superb acting of dustin hoffman and robert de niro well i want to point two less noticed aspects of this movie anne heche doing a perfect job as the perfect yes woman the counterpoint of hoffman and de niro the audience of their escapades admiring them when they work their magic getting angry at them when it all seems to fall apart  being the exact balance against which the two are to be compared the other hardly ever noticed aspect of this movie is the brilliant work of barry levinson  its not only the guiding of every actor and every actress not only the perfect pacing of the plot  its the amazing control he exerts over the look of the film the lighting and color control of this film are of the highest class ever achieved in cinema an aspect not commonly present in american cinema who pays much more attention to the story and often neglects its design have one more look at this film and pay attention to the way people are getting swallowed by the background shadows or of how they emerge from these shadows and then think of the fact that the entire film is about the shadow game of politics,black_comedy
a hollywood produced and white house sanctioned war and the hilarious marketing of their political lies carry this truer to life than wed like to believe comedy robert deniro  dustin hoffman are up to the task and leave plenty of room for the supporting folks gotta love the willie nelson music scenes and dennis learys usual train of thought shtick the directors mansion voting excuse banter is priceless for those who shutter at every liberal actor speech on democracy barry levinsons eventual prophetic presidency sex scandal and the result is an underrated political comedy with great entertainment legs there is no b3 bomber i dont know how these rumors get started uh we do,black_comedy
my reaction to this black comedy reminds me of how i felt when i first saw dr strangelove back in 1964 that movie was terribly funny even as slim pickens did the atomic midair rodeo ride that was destined to start world war iii yet i was chilled by the truth in the caricatures up there on the screen parodying our real leaders in a similar manner offers up the same kind of black comedy satire with great insight into how the modern amoral political pr mind works much was made at the time the movie debuted about its clairvoyance in depicting a president who needs to distract the country from his sexual dalliances however while that fact provides the motivation for the movie it really isnt central to its theme the problem just as well could have been illegal bribes or any other scandal the real guts of the film are right there in the title which is explained for us in detail in the opening credits in case we didnt get it the minions are running the show and the politicians are just bit players in the resulting drama the presidents face never even appears in the movie viewed from todays perspective 2002 this movie is far more relevant than when it first appeared because it understands the politics of terrorism suitcase bombs the increased role of the cia and at the end the need to go back to albania nee iraq and finish up the job it is definitely a far more relevant film to view today than it was in 1997,black_comedy
this film has a neat enough premise the us president gets caught with his hand in the underage cookie jar right before election time and his hatchetman conrad brean de niro goes out to divert public attention to do so he enlists the aid of hollywood producer stanley motss hoffman and the two cook up an entirely fictitious war for the president to deal with and solve in statesmanlike fashion it certainly captured the publics imagination at the time clinton  lewinsky went through a revival in the balkans during the kosovo crisis in the film the phony war is with albania which borders on kosovo and at the time of writing with the us economy in trouble and war with iraq looming is being dredged up again but i am sad to say has a fatal flaw in common with most conspiracy theories its credibility ceases about five minutes after the opening credits we are made to believe that every single person enlisted in brean and motsss project can be trusted to never say a word about this to anyone surely only dead men tell no tales but a trail of dead actors gaffers and special effects people would be noticed okay maybe not the actors its never made clear to us whether the war is completely fictional or its causes are fictional but the war is all too real in the former case any journalist arriving in albania would presumably notice a marked lack of us troops in the latter one would expect more in fact any footage of brean threatening the careers of various generals motss cooks up a fictional specops unit for dramatic purposes with the explanation that nobodys heard of it because its so secret this unit then parades down the washington mall its members faces visible to all and sundry in highly distinctive garb the halfblackhalfleopard print beret please contrary to practice of every existing specops unit most of the cast of deliver a fine performance the direction and production values are more than adequate all of it is ultimately wasted on a script which is riddled with holes through which you could drive an 18wheeler,black_comedy
this is a supercynical film that is incredibly entertaining insightful and oh so jaded the problem is that although its got a brilliant script the film will only appeal to a small select audience diehard clinton lovers will not appreciate the film as its a thinly veiled criticism of the clinton presidencyparticularly since the film is about some completely amoral spindoctors doing anything to save the butt of an amoral politician clinton lovers probably cant admit the truth of this aspect of his personality diehard clinton haters will no doubt love the film frankly im rather libertarian in view and think the nonsense in this film could apply to any politician so those jaded viewers like myself will probably appreciate the edgy and dark humor,black_comedy
alfred hitchcock once said the audience is like a giant organ that you and i are playing at one moment we play this note on them and get this reaction and then we play that chord and they react that way and someday we wont even have to make a movietherell be electrodes implanted in their brains and well just press different buttons and theyll go ooooh and aaaah and well frighten them and make them laugh wont that be wonderful  this movie asks is thatwonderfulbeyond this motion picture has entered the national dialectic as a concept some pundits have alluded to this movie as being eerily prescient about us domestic and foreign policy issues in the last half of the twentieth century depicts how media governments advertising and political figures manipulate emotions to garner public support or make moneyregardless of the extent to which you the viewer think that a scenario could occur this movie encourages critical thinking and reflection about propaganda and the manipulation of emotion during times of war the manufacturing of media and yellow journalismrobert evans the kid stays in the picture docudrama evans was the model for dustin hoffmans hollywood producer stanley motss led me to the movie and both movies complement each other welltoo bad motts wasnt given the line nothing beats good writing nothing and writers often receive little more credit than producers and are probably paid a whole lot less  so heres a thanks for the great writing screenwriters  and thanks to the editors director and producers too   eleven starsthe dvd version recommends other politically satirical movies and has other fun bonus features,black_comedy
what about sweden when the us president in 2017 creates a fake incident in sweden fake experts in the fox studio explain how sweden is overrun with a refugee crime wave this 20 year old movie suddenly becomes a lot less incredulous than it was perceived in its day and its a hoot,black_comedy
dear lord this film looked almost perfect great reviews good cast good story but it was all done so messily it looked like they put the movie together in about 2 days characters suddenly appear and then reappear without any explanation whatsoever the plot doesnt take time to explain itself and why the hell would they cast craig t nelson if he was going to only appear on tv an extra could do that  stop giving good reviews to these bad movies because im tired of wasting my time and money  i wish barry levinson had quit directing after rain man1988 because everything he has done since then has been crapp  i will be generous and give this 4 out of 10,black_comedy
robert de niro and dustin hoffman collaborate and con the entire united states voting public great idea rightright thats why its so disappointing for me to only be able to rate this movie 510 de niro is scruffy and jaded and dry per usual but hes great at it hoffman bumbles endearingly and the entire production curls up and dies twenty minutes in color me unimpressedits hard to tell what the writers thought the climax was but they were wrong watch the first twenty minutes and youll be in love watch the first thirty and youll be bored loses steam after it invests the entirety of itself in one joke that the public will throw itself behind a war if only the media baits it in that direction the rest is downhill things go wrong as de niro and heche try to keep their heads above water until the election but not wrong enough to be funny im upset that more energy wasnt put into the script did nobody realize they had robert de niro and dustin hoffman on the same side of a political satire hello where was the quick witty banter it pains me to say that their interactions were funnier in meet the fockersall in all lots of potential but an upsetting execution the idea of this movie is funnier than the movie itself,black_comedy
this movie tells the story of spin doctors who create a diversion to get heat off the president of the us in this case the president was accused of having sex with a young girl in the white house ironically this was made before the monica lewinskybill clinton affair so a spin doctor  played by robert de niro  is hired to find a way out of the predicament before election day his answer is to create a fake war with albanialest you think this is the rarest of all hollywood films  antidemocrat or even politically impartial story  no it stays true to form by making disparaging remarks only about conservatives reagan bush nixon etc there is nothing said about liberalsdemocrats of course dont hold your breath ever waiting for impartiality from the film world or the medianote there are a lot of fwords in here for those who are offended by that otherwise its a talky movie in general much like a play and its too talky that may be the main reason this movie was not a boxoffice success,black_comedy
i was expecting this movie to be a clever satire however there really was nothing clever about it it was just one south park style gag after another with about as much connection to reality as your average south park episode at least south park manages to be genuinely funny a lot of the time thoughthis movie doesnt its just stupid and contrived i did not laugh once or even chuckle watching this its just really stupid from start to finishwhat is the big satirical message here that politicians start wars as distractions that many people are very gullible when it comes to cheesy patriotism unless you are very naive the fact that these things happen should not come as news to youi guess from the high ratings some people saw some really deep subtext in this movie or thought the gags were hilarious or both but sorry i just dont see that,black_comedy
this file is not succesful its a comedy and we dont laugh its a satire and its incredible its too simple ok for the beginning ok for the play of dustin hofmann bravo  ok for the process of creation but the role of de niro is too narrow and why theres only two actors in the film  denis leary and  woody harelson cant play among others but the idea was good ,black_comedy
its two weeks before the presidents reelection and hes far ahead in the polls a sex scandal allegation with an underage firefly girl erupts threatening his lead spin doctor conrad brean robert de niro comes up with an idea to redirect the talk to albania along with winifred ames anne heche he recruits hollywood producer stanley motss dustin hoffman to manufacture a fake warthis is a brilliant satire with just enough realism for the audience to question whether this is actual reality de niro and hoffman are absolutely wonderful the humor is biting it hits both politics and hollywood the title literally infects the popular lexicon its a wonderfully funny satire,black_comedy
a political satire at its best i first watched this movie shortly after it was released and must admit i got much more out of it the second and third time at the least it makes you think even if you are not a conspiracy theorist i did not give this movie a higher rating because the top rated cast  de niro hoffman and heche only gave average performances and the direction was also average there was enough entertainment though to keep you interested until the end watch it and watch it again just to remind yourself that things are not always what they seem which is the one truth illustrated by this movie the rest of course is satire we would hope,black_comedy
i saw this movie with my dad when it came out on vhs being a very political minded man he instilled family values as well as pride for our country we loved this movie as he also taught us when we were kids big brother is always watching and told us we as citizens of this nation should not walk blindly through life take nothing for granted especially to not accept the idea that the government and media wouldnt possibly lie to usthere are reasons we do not know everythingi laughed so much during this movie and told him he was correct i thought this movie was very well done and would absolutely love to see a remake come out in the very near future given the state of our government today and how many sheeple are in existence who need to wake up and see things for what they really are i wish i had just a dollar for every time in my life i have said all i will say is wag the dog,black_comedy
i love this film the performances by de niro and hoffman are stunning and as a moving image professional i find the scene in the edit suite as they build up the poor girl in the war torn village shot so amusing and yet with so close to truth in many ways it is funny near the knuckle and scary because the undertones are so powerful if even a fraction of the spin doctor tactics coupled with political actions are true i think more people should see it i am amazed that it hasnt been on tv more i saw it at an arthouse cinema in berlin when i was going out with a german girl i have not seen it since anywhere maybe that is the powers that be pulling the strings in the background again they dont want anyone to see something that is so close to the truth i am a video producer and i want to tell you this is someones best wor,black_comedy
barry levinsons film is a political satire about a political spin doctor and hollywood producer who stage a war in albania to cover up the presidents sex scandal during the upcoming election we the audience are shown how conrad brean played by robert deniro and stanley motts played by dustin hoffman create an outlandish fake plot to distract the american public from sexual allegations made by the president after albanian war is created fake news footage is created within a studio create fads throwing shoes onto tree branches in support of a false war and catchy sayings with theme songs are created by famous country singers in support of their fake war hero sgt schumann who turns out to be psychotic resulting in his own death after that they stage a funeral procession for schuman its amazing how this whole big sham becomes breans best work because its so convincing and looks so authentic he is so proud and enamored with his own creative work he decides he wants credit and his greed and pride lead to his death the secret service take care of him good example of how the government can easily dispose of someone who gets in their way and no one would ever know the obvious message is americans believe what they are told and hate whom they are told to hate the american public is very gullible and too lazy to find out the whole situation and facts themselves in the film we see how people jumped on the bandwagon without giving the situation much thought i notice americans have become very complacent and comfortable within their overprotected lives we should be aware of global and national politics on a much larger scale we are so behind compared to other countries we should get more involved by questioning our government corruption exists in many government systems but the american people is the only country i know of that is either unaware or okay with that it was very frustrating to watch everyone go along with the diversion i am sure there is much we do not know i was actually rooting for brean and motts to fail but i am sure the outcome rings truethere are so many examples in american politics that resonate without own because american government has initialized wars iraq war and also created false sense of patriotism to get americans to back up their country even when the motives seem somewhat blurry weapons of mass destruction even when a conflict is real and necessary the gulf war for example the packaging of them is invariably shallow and unquestioning like sportswriters war correspondents abandon any pretense of objectivity and detachment and cheerfully root for our side at one point in the film levinson asks why does a dog wag its tail we are told because a dog is smarter than its tail to the film director the tail is smarter and we the viewers and american people are taken for a ride and invited to be that easily manipulated dog the message is clearly to be more aware of the government and become proactive by questioning what is going on and dont just accept everything the government tells you to be true learn the facts from both sides,black_comedy

just watched the film and i have very mixed feelings about it on the one hand it cannot be said that the film is bad it started out as a clever comedy it made its point about corrupt governments and general public believing anything they see on television all hints were clear all actors seemed okay dialogs were smart everything was fine closer to the end it felt like the writers got carried away and lost control to a certain extent becoming more illogical and absurd with each scene but considering that the film was a comedy it could be forgivenbut the ending just completely puzzled me i sat bewildered for five more minutes staring at the titles i did not understand what they wanted to say by thisthe first part of the film was a satire but it was funny all the inconsistencies exaggerations lack of logics and broad generalizations seen in the first part of the movie could be accepted only if the film posed as a satirical comedy i hate talking about happy endings but a more or less happy ending could help this movie stay a satirical comedy but the abrupt and cruel ending suddenly claimed that the film was politically realistic if so it rendered the rest of the movie almost totally ridiculous i do not want to say that a movie cannot or must not be funny and serious at the same time but in there is an abyss with a very thin bridge between the two aspects and it is not very good for stylei am not going to argue whether americans or other nations are actually so stupid en masse as to be so ignorant of the outside world and to believe everything their politicians say on tv maybe they are after all though i personally would like to hope they arent distract attention scenarios are quite popular nowadays even on the family scale to say nothing about politicians and governments manipulating the public opinion maybe it is actually possible to fake a war only the process would not be as simple as in the movie and would not involve so many people hundreds of potential leaks so basically from the viewpoint of credibility the scheme outlined in the film maybe holds water but the filmmakers should have been more careful about what they actually wanted if they wanted a cynical satire it should not have an ending like this and vice versa if they wanted a serious political warning of sorts all absurdities and inconsistencies in the first part should not stick out that much the movie and the ending just dont fit with each other and it leaves the impression of something not very carefully thought out and produced hurriedly with a mere aim of shocking the audience and making moneybut striking out the ending the film does give food for thought even though every idea in it is exaggerated to the point of absurd its not the best political satire in history but not the worst either just maybe it would be better to read the book after all,black_comedy
i had high hopes going into the cinema for this particular movie especially with the like of de niro and hoffman on the poster i knew it was going to be great and it actually wasthe movie itself is based on a novel and the screenplay adaptation really deserved accoladethe movie was up for 2 academy awards best actor hoffman  bestadapted screenplay whilst it didnt win either of them it really deserved tothe story actually isnt that hard to understand the president touches a young girl and the press are onto it like hotcakes so the presidents right hand man or in the case girl heche gets the presidential adviser de niro in to help fix the problem and with election on in 11 days it isnt going to be easy to fixde niro gets cutthroat  eccentric hollywood producer hoffman in on the scene and to divert the countries attention away from the sex scandal they decide to create a war hiring actresses to play young girls in the bombed wreckage and bringing in singers to create fullhearted songs to bring america back on the presidents side the three amigos heche de niro and hoffman actually do a magnificent jobwatch the movies for the laughs watch the movies for the music which unfortunately is not on cd but overall watch the movie to escape reality and to have a great hour and a halfan amazing movie a solid 910i would like to personally congratulate the actors on a remarkable performance,black_comedy
watching the movie has been an absolute delight aside from the fact that the leading actors are renowned as they are robert de niro dustin hoffman and denis leary played their parts terrifically the movie starts with anarchy in the white house as the president has been accused of molesting a young scoutgirl the special man de niro has been called to divert the eyes of the cia the opposition leader and the whole nations by starting a mystical war with albania qwhy albania a the question you should be asking is why not albania the plot thickens when a hollywood director is called to help orchestrate the biggest show blind the entire nation as old shoe or private shoemaker who inconveniently was a psychopath was declared a hero of their ongoing orchestration i dont want to spoil the whole movie for you guys but its safe to say there were a lot of cracks in the movie that made it a classic,black_comedy
i am commenting just now because i cant believe some people didnt get how brilliant this film isi heard this film was shot in 29 days and if that is the casewell you can forgive any imperfection keep that rushed schedule in mind looks like they were trying to release it before the actual zippergate brokei work in the film industry so i appreciate the jaded hollywood characters it was right on the money  i remember walking out of the theatre thinkingthat was really entertaining910,black_comedy
is one of my favourite films because it contains nothing except well known actors a typical hollywoodmovie should contain there are no special effects there is no love story and there are no big emotions but thats exactly why the movie is so cool it is full of latent jokes although it wasnt a very successful film i think dustin hofmann robert de niro anne heche and especially woody harrelson were fantastic,black_comedy
why does a dog wag its tail because a dog is smarter than its tail if the tail were smarter than the dog the tail would so say the opening credits of barry levinsons political satire one of the best bites at american politics ever made levinson diner rain man has made some great films in his career is one of his most charismatic and energeticthe film concerns itself with the medias close links with the government in it a veteran spin doctor hires a hollywood megaproducer to help start a false war in an effort to divert attention from the presidents alleged underage affair with a firefly girl the spin doctor is played by robert de niro the bigshot hollywood producer is dustin hoffman together de niro and hoffman create one of the best teams in ages  and hoffmans performance in particular is scenestealingconrad brean de niro is under pressure to resurrect the presidents chances at being reelected so he and stanley motss hoffman start using any means necessary to jumpstart their phony war along with the help of an associate anne heche they travel around the country stirring up controversy about the war creating false war heroes alerting america of possible attacks by albania their false war target in todays day and age it almost seems uncannily close to realitythe movie has extremely funny scenes all very realistic in nature people who appreciate films will love because of its hollywood references did you know theres no academy award for producing motss asks brean throughout the movie he relates unexpected and overwhelming incidents to his past this is nothing compared to when one of my projects had its funding canceled after four months motss says everyone rolls their eyes theyve heard the story beforethen theres the part where we meet up with the fake war hero that brean has hired hes played by woody harrelson and is a convict what did he do someone asks murdered a nun is the reply then we find out that the convict is running low on medication which results in some very funny jokesi have to admit that im surprised some scenes were present in the finished cut such as the indication that a presidents staff is corrupt enough to actually do such things as those we see in the film is bold enough to actually use scenes such as this to its advantage what might come across as rude or possibly irreverent becomes quite hilarious in a film crammed with celebrity cameos ranging from denis leary to craig t nelson willie nelson shows up and is hired to write a patriotic war song albania albania he croons yeah that rhymes motss saysthroughout the movie hoffmans performance is frantic and wild resulting in a rather hyperactive character who is constantly talking moving yelling or worrying although de niro stole the show in analyze this hoffman does the same in creating a very memorable character to add to his resumethe movie was written by david mamet and hilary henken mamet has an ear for great dialogue always has and undoubtedly most of the solid dialogue in could be attributed to his credit as cowriter mamet also wrote the script for de niros were no angels which costarred sean penn and was a fairly enjoyable and underrated comedy about two convicts who escape from jail and try to cross the canadian border only to be mistaken for catholic priests it wasnt a great movie but due to mamet de niro and penn it succeeded as light entertainment what was missing was the solid dialogue present in mamets other scripts and theres plenty of it in there are a handful of quotes from this film that i will probably never forgetmovies such as dont come around very often and when they do theyre usually a lot tamer this is a film that i believe the majority of americans will enjoy because theyll find themselves realizing how realistic and yet also farfetched the jokes are personally i also loved the little digs targeted at hollywood in a subtler way the film bites at hollywood in the same way that get shorty and adaptation didwith barry levinsons career now being harmed by disasters such as envy is good proof that he still can direct a very solid comedy  he just needs to learn to turn down certain scripts in favor of better ones,black_comedy
i remember when this movie came out and i couldnt wait to see it i was disappointed though which is surprising as this is one i actually expected to love in fact i expected to love this so much i was kind of baffled when i didnt i did love the plot unfortunately it doesnt unfold in a very interesting way there was just something missing from this it should have had more impact in the way it enfolded given the subject matter but there was something missing and im not even sure i know whati think this could have been an oscar winning film i mean it had a great cast a really interesting plot i think had this really been done well or better people would have been flocking to itbut word of mouth kind of spreads and truth be told this just wasnt great the films pace was awful and there was no sense of excitement which is needed in a movie to hook the viewer also with a plot like this the whole movie should have been riveting but it wasnt in this case there was no tension to the movieto sum up great cast great plot but not so great enfolding and ultimately disappointing,black_comedy
considering the clever plot line and the highly talented cast i still marvel at the fact that i rewound the video before the movie was completed perhaps i expected too much but this movie peaked at the beginning and went down hill from there,black_comedy
sure that sounded interesting at first a movie about spinmeisters starring robert de niro and dustin hoffman thats actually the only thing to be remembered one good idea buried under mass ineptitudethe biggest mistake is in the tone who wants to see a movie where the main characters are babbling about fooling their fellow citizens and having fun along the way somebody wanted to compare this to such a welltailored political satire as dr strangelove well thats an outrage kubrick masters black humor in this movie whereas only circles inwards around the starting pointthe story only gets duller as new elements unfold to make the movie longer and we never care about this stuff supposed to occur in the final days leading to a presidential election no suspense no rhythm nothing all in all a general failure where nothing is to be saved even dustin hoffmans work is just as painfully ridiculous as the whole wouldbedeepandfunny fumbled fable,black_comedy
the worst film ive seen since highlander ii flimsy plotline ham acting from deniro and hoffman i almost fell asleep and should have walked out a number of people around 15  left in midfilm that says it all  levinsons worst ever film and to think people will get this turkey out on video seeing as it was hyped and advertised to make it seem watchable i voted 1 out of 10  if only a zero score had been available,black_comedy
there was a lot of talent wasted in this movie i must say that my wife and had a difficult time watching it all after 45 minutes we were no longer engaged in the story i was expecting satire but not silly slapstick they could have done so much with this movie and this cast a lot of time was spent drilling down on minute aspects of the scheme and i felt they were flogging a point endlessly for example the producer wanted a kitten in a scene and several minutes was spent on him complaining until he got the kitten he was looking for the movie develops very slowly almost painfully so the conflict between the conspirators and the cia was very artificial with a conclusion that made no sense i am guessing the idea was to make all government agencies as well as politicians look foolishthe movie succeeded in doing so this but in the end the whole story was pretty foolish and lacked anything that would maintain interest,black_comedy
i first watched this film when it was first shown on cable over here in the uk and i switched it over after about 45 minutes i just couldnt take any more of the mind numbing drivel it was on again yesterday and as nothing else decent was on at the time i thought i would give it another chance oh how i regret that how such acting heavyweights as hoffman and deniro ever got involved in such a pitifully boring film as this i will never know an absolutely ridiculous plot  yes i know it was satire but come on  hardly any action worth talking about and script writers that must have been absolutely steaming drunk or stoned out their heads when writing it or theyve never lived in the real world as i said i know its satire and i dont mind satire but this film takes satire to knew levels a really really bad film,black_comedy
this is a political satire done right these can be hilarious but is not done right granted this might have been made as a response to the clinton sex scandal but if it was done better it could have been a stinging comment on the bush administration or any corrupt government entity as well however doesnt take any risks and all the potshots that it takes are broad and tiredtwelve days before the election the president is caught in a huge scandal to find a way out and still keep the presidency he asks conrad brean robert deniro for help brean decides that the best way to get past this is to distract the public with a phony war with albania to accomplish this he hires bigtime hollywood producer stanley motss dustin hoffman to pull it offthe problem with this movie is that its a onejoke movie and its really not that funny the joke is that politicians are full of crap and the public is too stupid and easily distracted to pay attention to anything thats not in the front page headlines i wont necessarily disagree with either of those comments but both have been done to death and the way barry levinson chooses to meld the two isnt very interesting and certainly not funnyhoffman and deniro are two of the most celebrated actors around but this movie just isnt a good use of their talents they play their parts well but its all for naught anne heche is good as their political liaison but again the movie is below her talent level woody harrelson is amusing in his small role but little elsethe film isnt a total waste there are a few amusing bits here and there but certainly not worth a recommendation,black_comedy
is an excellent political satire that has an all too realistic feeling it was shown on dutch television one day before the new american president was elected in 2004 of course this was a well chosen moment  the movie is about how a spin doctor and a hollywood producer make sure the president will be in office for another four years and they dont mind to spread some rumors for the good causewhat makes this movie so special is the fact that it isnt far from the truth this movie was made in 1997 but it is so unbelievably relevant today that it almost makes you feel this producers could see the future if you see what happened with george w bush his failure to capture osama bin laden before the elections starting a war in iraq to camouflage this failure you can only watch this movie with your mouth wide open ok there is a difference between the truth and this story of course but in the end you really can see many similarities this is how the story goes the president is caught up in a sex scandal two weeks before the election and his spin doctor is brought in to fix things up they decide to fake a war with albania with the help of a hollywood producer they invent a story start some rumors and studio footage is inserted into the news to create the illusion of a war so the attention of the public is diverted away from the scandal of course things go wrong but time after time they know to make it work i guess this movie will not be appreciated by everybody i can imagine that most bush adepts dont even understand the underlying message of the movie because even in reality they swallow whatever is served to them by the presidents team of spin doctors no i guess it will be nonamericans like me and the democratic voters that will see the humor in this movie i know i had some good laughs and i reward it with an 810 this should be seen by all americans,black_comedy
hahaha  i thought this film was really goodi seen it and thought de niro must be good and i wasnt disappointed i never really used to like hoffman i seen him in mad city with travolta recently and didnt really like him i suppose he was alright in outbreak but he was excellent in thisthe plot was excellent got you wondering about a lot of things i started getting very suspicious watching it but overall very true as well oh i believe that i seen it on television it must be true  hahaha de niro was great in it as well obviously and i was surprised at the amount of people in the supporting cast anne heche woody harrelson etc etca good film quite a witty humour found myself giggling quite a lot  mainly at hoffmans character good stuffa very enjoyable 810dave,black_comedy
after all the attention the movie got and with the strong cast i expected a great movie  instead i got an unbelievable story that just kept running and running  the idea of faking a war just wasnt plausible and after sitting through the whole movie the ending was a big letdown,black_comedy
great film that is a black satire on politics fantastic cast that support one of my favourite films this is a mainstream indie film that works and provides evidence of the strength of storytelling and script development 28 days to create a film like this is just amazing,black_comedy
i just got this out of my local dvd store in london and really enjoyed it i first watched this on video tape from the same store and liked it way back then second time around i actually thought it was better i was laughing out loud in places it holds up well with time it ticks all the boxes for me good script good cast well acted well written and well directed i must say i did enjoy it 7510,black_comedy
president of the united states becomes involved in a sex scandal with a girl scout only 11 days before election day and in comes the ultimate political spin doctor robert deniro to save the campaign the first step in his plan is to enlist a hollywood producer dustin hoffman to create the appearance of a war with albania in order to distract the electorate and rally them behind their country and its president at least until election day along with sometimes reluctant help of a presidential aide anne heche the producer also brings in his idea people denis leary andrea martin and willie nelson to create what he calls his pageantthis a wonderfully wicked satire from director barry levinson and cowriter david mamet which skewers the populist electoral process and the media which propigates that process while it is wildy unbelievable at times it also seems all to real in addition to aforementioned cast members all of whom are quite fun to watch we also get woody harrelson as an unsuitable war hero and kirsten dunst as an actress who finds this a role she cant include on her resumethe only real flaw is that it seems to suffer a little in the fine tuning and could have been a little bit more polished this was apparently the result of the fact that the will was made very quickly and with a budget of a mere 15 millionthe film was one of a trio of very good political satires to come out within about a year the others being primary colors with john travola and emma thompson and bulworth with warren beatty,black_comedy
the movie had such a good premise but failed they got lost right after it started a dozen or so rewrites should have helped i kept waiting for it to get better instead it was just agony waiting for it to end it had all the right elements but failed like the direct opposite of the producers,black_comedy
wag the doglevinsons smart and electrifying schemes on conjuring the elections is a work of pure art and not your usual sketchy comic drama from the first frame the tale generates an exuberant energy on screen with pragmatic conversation that fuels on the environment offered to it that feels honest and real to the core similar to your usual mundane office day this hectic week triumphs on its cutthroat sarcasm and hilarious ideologies unlike your usual structure it is a one big act that feeds on high pitched dramatic antics that the gripping screenplay is brimmed of the makers arent hesitating on making big provocative decisions their genuinely effective feeling towards justifying the characters is a testament to the writers brillianceas much as hilarious the film is the grasp of it towards practicality grows stronger and stronger that induces eye popping complex drama among the characters that are all at their vulnerable point of their life either through success or failure the content revolving around such political crises ought to have a diverse solution and levinsons world has managed to be diplomatic yet accurate to its requirements and answers hoffman at the realm of it is a delight to watch he can pull off comic timing as perfect as his dramatic performance isin fact arguably hoffman is a much better humorisc than de niro is his body language speaks for his intentions that are sinister and quirky de niro in his underdog character that is often retreated by the makers as a trump card in crisis and he flaunts majestically on screen especially the first time macy confronts him for some questioning hecke supports convincingly and harrelson lifts the film to a whole new level through his cynicism leaves its audience wagging the tale merrily,black_comedy
the premise of this movie is simple only two weeks before election day a sitting president is hit by a sex scandal a brief dalliance with a firefly girl becomes public knowledge and now his 17 lead is about to plummet winifred ames anne heche one of the presidents top aides calls in spin doctor extraordinary conrad bream robert de niro conrad goes to work immediately deciding that the best way to get the publics mind off the firefly girl is to give them something bigger to think about change the story change the lead is his motto so he decides to manufacture a war against albania brilliant performances by dustin hoffman and de niro make this an intelligent laugh riot levinson and mamet have created a minor masterpiece of comedy,black_comedy
greetings from lithuania1997 in my opinion was and still is one of the most original and best satyric political comedies ive ever seen not that there are many movies in this so called genre but stands out even from them this movie has a highly original concept which was very relevant back in the day when this movie was released the script is not short of excellent acting by both leads was amazing directing was crystal clear overall is still one of the very best in its style script and overall concept it is highly smart plausible funny and entertaining great movie,black_comedy
this movie is considered a comedydrama i get that because of the way the actors portray the characters but the underlying storyline is very disturbing think all of the presidencies since reagan consider their election campaigns the wars they justified the entire thing seems scripted like a hollywood blockbuster all the way down to lee greenwoods anthemic song it all makes an intellectual mind wonder just how far up the marionette strings go and who is actually holding them watch this movie and bypass the useless comedic turns by the always great hoffman and deniro go into it looking for the underlying message its thereeven in the title of the movie we are the dog that is being wagged,black_comedy
every political satire ive watched requires some engagement to seem plausible except this one is the only one of its kind that contains just enough realistic weight to be uncomfortably realistic you will laugh out loud and feel that all things make a lot of sense without wondering also it doesnt try to be bitter and harsh as other satirical movies do in fact its always fluffy and warm and that makes the movie quiet ironical in its own especially because its very very painfully relevant all the actors delivered terrific performances and there is superb chemistry between every actor and another even who have smaller roles needless to say robert de niro is great but dustin hoffman is who steals the show hoffman gave one of the best performances in his entire career actually i will put his performance in right after the performance that made him a household name in the graduate but lets put that off till i watch rain man woody harrelson also has a small role in this movie and although his character in not very interesting especially because it was in the weakest part of the movie when it dragged a little bit harrelsons impeccable performance is not to blame every single subtle trick in makes you burst out laughing and the movie takes advantage of all these tricks and small details until the credits roll it never wastes any clever joke that made you laugh and uses it again in a more clever way to make you laugh over it again and againbarry levinsons direction is so smart clever and slick he made the movie fastpaced and that was a good decision but i think he could have concentrated on the funniest moments in the movie to make them more pleasant and to make them memorable not only funny i have kinda the same issue with one of my alltime favorite movies the graduate i think mike nichols should have focused on the drama more than he did the political commentary was a little onthenose at first but barry levinsons wit direction outweighed this little issue from the beginning and the result is one of if not the funniest political satire movie ive ever seen8510,black_comedy
washington dc is just as it is portrayed in this film de niro and hoffman are really fantastic actors yes it is a satire on last years of clinton but politics of those days was connected to slobodan milosevic and his mad politics belgrade tv showed the film just before the nato started air strikes on serbiawhy do we have to wage war on each other the answer is simple there is disagreement always on about how people should live just a day before air strikes started i remember jelcin warning clinton on how he should not decide how people should live i am so glad nato bombed serbia but 911 was certain retribution it is tit for tat and it always is just as the first kind of men beat each other with wooden batons we today beat each other with bombswho has the bigger bomb has the bigger dic that is basics of the international affairs,black_comedy
the us president has just been exposed in a sex scandal not long before the next election rather than resign or take responsibility white house spin doctorsled by robert de nero  anne heche instead contact a hollywood producerdustin hoffman quite funny to direct an elaborate hoaxed war with albania in hopes that the nation will rally behind their incumbent president and forgetforgive the sex scandal things get complicated when a war herowoody harrelson turns out to be a psychopath and later on when the director insists on putting it on his resumeingenious satire by director barry levinson is extremely clever  knowing since it wouldnt be that difficult to pull off a hoax on the american people if handled properly and had the complicity of the media behind it not many people to identify with here so it is emotionally detached but such a deadon portrayal of media and government complicity that it doesnt matter good old shoe is a prime example of what i meanalso appreciated its nonpartisanship stance since this scenario would apply to either side,black_comedy
its fascinating how the september 11th attacks outdated everything making the first gulf war as far in memories as the vietnam one people are less to blame than the mediacentric system that knew how to deal with the public emotion and the key thing is that emotion has a shortterm memory george w bush could get away with the second gulf war on the basis of fallacious arguments just by exploiting the september 11 trauma and any attempt to question his choices could immediately lead to antipatriotic accusations and this emotional exploitation is the basis of barry levinsons a hilarious satire in the same vein of sharpness than such masterpieces as network or dr strangelove and as prophetic in august 1998 bill clinton confessed of having had inappropriate conduct with monica lewinsky a few days later terrorist strongholds were bombed in africa in response to the attack of the american embassy in tanzania replace monica lewinsky by a firefly girl africa by albania clinton by an unknown president and you have the basic plot of and by plot i mean the story the way it is shown on tv to the american audience yet is less about the plot than the plottersstarts with a crisis the president has been caught with an underage girl and his opponents prepared an accusing videotape clip using thank heaven for little girls as musical background 11 days before the election if the presidents men lead by a woman winifred ames anne heche dont come up with an idea and quick the president is screwed and his lame we dont change horses in midstream campaign wont help they call conrad brean a spindoctor played by robert de niro he comes up with the most likely idea to distract the audience from a scandal a war the easiest catalysis of sentimentalism and emotions through sheer patriotism as long as people would be thirsty for magnificent displays of solidarity and humanity incarnated by these we are the worldlike songs it would be easy to manipulate them so lets start with rumors about a b3bomber theres no b3bomber great even deny its existencebarry levinsons film hooks us to breans smartness so well that we even forget that the president would indeed deserve to lose these elections it already starts to work on us if the tail was smarter than the dog it would the dog is the audience give them what they want and they will bite it its all a matter of storytelling as a screenwriter student i was taught that what counts the most in a story is the idea the premise then comes the plot and then the storytelling all count but it all starts with the idea the war was the idea but then the rest of the plot comes up very fluidly in albania why why not who knows about it anyway who knew about afghanistan iraq or vietnam anyway what matters is that a country shows as a potential threat to what to the united states to its lifestyle its values  the plan cant fail the whole storyline comes us so fluidly that the scandal is almost forgotten but we live in a mediacentric society people need images they cant rely their emotional involvements on rumors on unseen stuff time for the second protagonist of the film to make his flamboyant entrance its dustin hoffman in an electrifying performance as stanley motts the producer hes as passionate dedicated and enthusiastic about producing as depp in ed wood except that he has talent and this is why the team hires him he constructs a war with archive footage sound effects and a young actress to play an albanian refugee kirsten dunst people need a gimmick like the stray cat in vito corleones hands give her a kitten motts understands very well how the identification process works it asks for symbols for colors for memorable stuff like the raising of the flags in iwojima or the naked girl in vietnam makes us laugh for the same reasons network angered usyet as funny and goofy as it is the oscarnominated script the second nomination along with hoffman never takes its original premise for granted and takes us to unexpected and realistic twists without losing this capacity to surprise at one point the cia bought by the other side makes a surprising statement theres no war anymore and brean suddenly abandons the whole plot because its over how so he saw it on tv tv is the alpha and omega the network days are not over this is where motts surpasses his mentor with his unforgettable catchphrase this is nothing the war wont be over until he says when its over the war was just a pivotal moment but like every story you need a second pivot how about a hostage a war hero a man who was kept prisoner abandoned like an oldshoe how about a folk song titled old shoe a soldier whose name starts with shoe like william schumann woody harrelson you would believe this is really nothingthe saddest thing about the film is that even after watching this the tail still wags us as we allowed many pseudo wars to happen so even if it isnt the first political film to highlight the connection between politics and mediamanipulation its the most related to our time its also a remarkably insightful film about the creative process of storytelling and a job passion moss is too obsessed by his talent that hell never accept the idea of not taking credit from it while brean is the straight man who takes everything so normally he reminded me of another expert from a same years movie tommy lee jones in men in black except that breans underworld is much scarier,black_comedy
when the president is involved in scandal shortly before the election a hollywood producer is brought in to manufacture a war in albania to distract from the scandal and that the president can endhas a great premise that was prescient before the film was released president clinton was involved in the sex scandal with monica lewinsky and he threatened military action in iraq the really frightening thing is that in one of the clips shown in the film a young woman wearing monicas beret can be seen it reminded me a little of the situation when alfred hitchcock was filming notorious and his mcguffin was the uranium to make an atom bomb being hidden in wine bottles it was entirely innocent on his part but the fbi had him under surveillance for months wondering what he knew about the uranium stores in south america that actually existeddustin hoffman is stanley motss the producer brought in by political adviser conrad bean robert deniro to produce the war anne heche plays a presidential aide and the film also includes william h macy kirsten dunst andrea martin denis leary and willie nelsonthe sad thing is that i suppose all this is possible despite some obvious holes in the david mamethilary henkin script the media can certainly manipulate and why wouldnt gullible people believe what they are being shown maybe its based on the premise that the american people are fairly dumb and if you dont agree with that you probably wont like itnevertheless puts forth a provocative idea and gets you thinking and its great to see hoffman and deniro as two clever albeit sleazy people who believe the end justifies the means,black_comedy
 the administrations ambitions to manage the news knew no bounds frank rich the greatest story ever sold writing about condi rices attempt to keep bin laden videos out of the mediaof course theres a war  i saw it on tv robert de niro wag the dogis a movie its ostensibly a satire but as roger ebert insightfully observes it is getting harder for satire to stay ahead of realitythe us president in a sex scandal what can the american government do to atone for it not apologize to the public or make amends or even try to make the president a better man  but manufacture a fake war to take the focus off him just two weeks before an election hes termed a government spin doctor in the junkets but robert de niros character conrad brean is what mobsters would call a cleaner and isnt the government just a legalized form of thug life he makes problems go away he and the white house pr aide anne heche manufacture the war with albania because no one knows where it is or whats happening there with the help of a hollywood producer stanley motss dustin hoffman channeling robert evans aided by denis leary facilitator and willie nelson composing a theme song for the conflict bringing home a fake war vet who happens to be ptsd to the gills woody harrelson and tailed by william h macy ciacucumber note to comes from the saying a dog is smarter than its tail but if the tail were smarter then the tail would it refers to purposely diverting attention away from something of importance to something of lesser significance catapulting the insignificant event into the limelight in other words to create a straw manim biting my tongue here on the real life parallels of american government is an allegory of this orwellian society sometimes called america where government manufactures crises in order to solve them and pretend efficiency like the bailout crisis of 2008 like the debt ceiling crisis of 2011 who caused them not us who solved them not us but the taxes and fortunes of the oblivious american people were raided by the american government as excuse for the quelling of those crisesso the uncomfortable dichotomy in is its biting humor for the audacity of the liars in this story tempered with outrage for the audacity of the liars in real life that this story bases itself on movie brings together acting legends de niro and hoffman cheekily playing off each other like a devil against an atheist de niros diabolical twinkle in his eye says do right by me or you will burn in a lake of fire and hoffmans cute obliviousness doesnt truly believe a lake of fire exists unless he produces the movie about itflooding the media with war images produced by motss brean can safely proclaim to his cia questioners who doubt the veracity of the war of course theres a war  i saw it on tv and our minds again wander to the terrifying reality of orwells america how the bush admin flooded the media with news conferences that they engineered themselves as propaganda to showcase their murderous policies like shock and awe and nonsensical programs like no child left behind to check off their evermoving benchmarks in the fake war on terror to prove their transparency ironically by being duplicitous its not just the felons in the bush administration every government finagles the media but the bush klan were so hamhanded and arrogant that they blew it for everyone now we know it is common practice to hire pr companies like bursonmarsteller to rebrand activities entities corporations even policies to repackage lies and malfeasance in as in real life they plant reporters in press conferences to ask questions that they answer with their spin they disallow legitimate investigative reporters into their midst for fear of diluting the message they preclude unfavorable coverage by threatening the news networks with lack of access ie either report the lies or report nothing at all any news is better than no news released in 1997 when clinton was prosecuting his own underhanded wars with little or no media coverage whether this movie is satire or fact it is undeniably prophetic because in 2011 this is exactly how war is being prosecuted in america  via the media if you plop a person anywhere in america with no access to media they could live out their life oblivious to america supposedly involved in two wars and innumerable illegal skirmishes pon de side if you did not turn on the news would you ever know about drone attacks in libya or yemen or pakistan its just a frivolous game that politicians think its their job to play assholes as keith olbermann used to say george w bush is having a war in iraq  for the sake of having a war in iraq as brean and his associates escalate the war they escalate the lies to unimaginably audacious proportions the aide constantly wondering if the lies will take with the public of course they do when tv talks people listen how many citizens of the indoctrinated united states of america will come away from knowing that it was a riotous satire once upon a short time ago but has turned into a depiction of unethical real life political engineering only much tamer,black_comedy
how can you save the reelection of the president of the united states when he is blamed in the media for having sexual contact with an underage firefly girl two weeks before the elections that is the question which is asked in the beginning of the film with the answer the director barry levinson achieved a nomination for the oscar and the golden globe award but this success is a result of the good performance of many great actors like dustin hoffman as a star especially in the comedy genre robert de niro or denis leary toothe us president michael belson is hoping of a reelection but two weeks before the election a report of a sexual contact with him and an underage firefly girl in the oval office is intended to print on the front page of the washington post the adviser of the president winifred ames anne heche does ones utmost to prevent this she invites the spin doctor conrad brean robert de niro tot he white house he is supposed to manipulate the media and publish rumors he creates the following plan the report oft he sexual contact has to be replaced by an bigger topic which concerns the whole country so mr brean invent a b3bomber and a entire war against albanian and let a spokesman publish it for this plan he gets help by the big hollywood producer stanley motss dustin hoffman who creates for example video footage which is then shown in the mediathe message of the movie is clear the politician uses the media by manipulating and faking the truth to improve the image of themselves because thats the most important thing which matters in an presidential elections and because of the great performance for example of dustin hoffman who is perfectly cast with the role of stanley motss as the producer who is always relaxed funny but also focused on his work the movie reaches to convey this message in a quite funny way the movie is full of criticism of the own political system criticism of the movie is that it drift away from the imaginable reality some circumstances which are direct by the team are overdone and its not imaginable that the truth wont come outalthough i finally would rate the film with four out of five stars its a great movie and i can recommend it to everyone who like to watch how the media can be used to manipulate an image for example in films like thank you for smoking ,black_comedy
is the blend of politics and media that may be true but is generally accepted ignored or disbelieved although the portrayal in this film is surely exaggerated it is sadly probably not far from the markas is wellknown now this film came out around the same time president clinton had a sex scandal of his own to deal with some have accused him of deflecting criticism by talking up violence towards iraq the fact this film was made just before such an event makes it even more importantwith a great early performance by kirsten dunst and the winning combination of william h macy dustin hoffman and robert deniro can this film really ask for more oh and theres denis leary willie nelson and shooter jennings too,black_comedy
despite being an oscar contender and its imposing credentials i had missed out on this one back in the day i can see how it may be construed as having dated in the interim  dealing as it does with an attempt to coverup a presidential sex scandal actually anticipating the official disclosure of bill clintons alleged affair with monica lewinsky which needless to say could jeopardize his chances at the upcoming elections right now i do not recall if clintons underlings came up with some fantastic ruse to divert attention from the incident but this being the cinema it is naturally taken to extremes  since a hollywood bigwig reportedly based on robert evans is actually recruited to produce a fictitious war evidently the key here is satire and the script which received one of the films two oscar nods certainly manages to be inventive throughoutbut somehow the end result turns out to be a bit too lowkey for its own good and therefore not quite as scathing as it could and should have been we are left however with a handful of excellent performances led by an oscarnominated dustin hoffman as the diminutive but undeniably resourceful and confident producer who comes with his own team of collaborators and ultimately grows recalcitrant when his baby is taken away from him robert de niro as the spin doctor to whom the white house turns for help when the crisis surfaces and who prompts the obviously hushhush involvement of hollywood and anne heche who surprisingly holds her own in their company as the presidential aide overseeing the elaborate hoax also on hand is countrysinger willie nelson assigned the task of concocting an anthem for this latest show of strength by the usa and there are nice cameos by the likes of william h macy as a cia operative who smells a rat kirsten dunst as an aspiring actress chosen to interpret a harassed albanian in the makebelieve conflict and especially woody harrelson as a wouldbe stranded soldier afforded heroic status but who eventually displays lessthanadmirable qualities that hilariously prove his untimely undoing the film also gives one a rare behindthescenes look at the creation of visual effects  it is at once interesting and amusing but not necessarily coming across as a deliberate deconstruction of the moviemaking magic incidentally hoffman had won his second oscar for rain main 1988 under levinsons direction the two of them and de niro had actually already worked together on sleepers 1996 which i have yet to check out whereas levinson and de niro would eventually reunite for the nottoodissimilar if decidedly inferior what just happened 2008 see my review elsewhere,black_comedy
interesting i enjoyed this the films basic idea is that of a shadow government engineering the american presidents pr during the critical days leading up to the election and with the aid of a hollywood producer  no less the film wears out its basic premise in about the first 30 minutes really you could very well stop watching it at that point  from there it hammers the same points over and over  the easy manipulation of mass media and public herd mentality the general gullibility of people to believe whatever they are told to believe the conscious nihilism of powerful men blah blah blah blah blahthe first twist in the tale arrives at about the 39minute mark in the form of a cia sleuth played by william h macy this is the only twist in the whole film that makes sense and macy in his tiny role is very good barry levinson is a thoughtful filmmaker but he was not the right choice for this story after a promising start the film feels slow plodding and predictable just imagine what oliver stone or scorsese would have done with this material they would have made the interactions so much more powerfuljust because de niro produced this movie tribeca does it therefore become inevitable that he must star in it  the guy does absolutely nothing here its yet another youdontarguewithme performance,black_comedy
i wanted to like this movie but about 30 minutes in i just gave up i had to suspend too much disbelief to buy the phony war scam the characters were pulling off i dont know what a phony computer generated war would look like but it would have to be more compelling that the image of kirsten dunst clutching a kitty part of my problem with this movie was casting just too many actors that i find annoying robert deniro is just robert denirothe same robert deniro hes been in his last half dozen or so movies dustin hoffman is simply a chore to look at and listen to and then theres anne im a lesbian oh wait no im not heche they even throw in the grating dennis leary for good measure and why was willie nelson in this movie it was around the time that nelson was having the jam session with the black musician that i realized that this was simply levinson doing a watered down altman schtick silly and unengaging rent bob roberts instead,black_comedy
this is easily the most accurate political satire ever committed to film it shows the potential for government to manipulate media during times of crisis whether political scandal or war  this film has repeatedly come true since it came out first during the monica lewinsky scandal and now in the war on terrorism and iraq  furthermore the film is extremely funny with great performances from willie nelson and woody harrelson everyone should see it,black_comedy
rarely in hollywood cinema do you find a film so honest and critical of the media  is a brutally dark comedy that touches viewers because well we suspect its true  the idea that political figures would go so far as to invent a fictional war to distract the public from a personal scandal is not so farfetched  in fact the structure of our society is such that if this tale had been true and the truth had been revealed that we bought into this fantasy as depicted in the movie most people would secretly admire the mastermind of the plot just as viewers of this film cant help but admire robert deniros character  deniro and his costar dustin hoffman are such masters that their performances in this film although certainly not their most impressive work are more than believable and entirely engrossing  aided by a hilariously earnest supporting cast and concise intelligent scripting they make this film an entertaining and thoughtprovoking diversion  7 stars,black_comedy
one of the best films ever made it is not really the film itself but the idea which the film represents  i believe now  in war times  it is even more comprehensiblei think every voter should see this film in order not to be driven away by lies and political interests so that he or she can make a better decision on who to elect and on what basis,black_comedy
the further i am away from seeing this movie the better more relevant it gets i just cannot help to draw parallels with anthrax scare abouttobeunleashed war with iraq including the man left behind bit poor state of economy and upcoming elections the movie this good at predicting real events has to be praised 810 should be watched as a double feature with bowling for columbine,black_comedy
if the tail were smarter than the dog the tail would clever sarcastic cinic the movie shows how to manipulate the public opinion and how to redirect the feelings of masses de niro and hoffman are simply great and they dominate the whole movie with their presence that was a cool movie,black_comedy
i had to watch this movie for critical thinking class when we were talking about fallacies and this movie basically deals in the red herring fallacy overall the movie was quite entertaining it was pretty funny to see how the public was manipulated  its also interesting to note that the movie was released so close to the clintonlewinsky fiasco  still there were a lot of dull slow moments and thats why i wouldnt give this movie a higher score,black_comedy
i love this one because it shows how dangerous it can be if only one country concentrates all the power enough to not start but fake a war in an independent country even if it is a cover up on a sexual harassment case involving the president or any economic or political reasons and also hits hard when it shows how easy is to manipulate the masses thru television and media funny yes intelligent too original sure but the point must never be forgotten after all nobody can be sure that it wont become reality810,black_comedy
you have two screen legends robert deniro and dustin hoffman onpaper you might think they will try to outdo each other when you watch the movie you will find that they work great together the writing is superb and delivered at a machine gun speed you have to pay attention at all times or you will miss some jokes the plot is great the movies running time is short and snappy and the supporting players are well cast denis leary was a nice choice for the quick speed of the dialog i wouldnt be a bit surprised to learn that there are people like the characters in this movie how much can we really trust the government and what they will and wont tell us anyway a definite must see,black_comedy
i first saw years ago when it first came out but having just seen it again i cant help seeing parallels with the events of 911if bush didnt engineer those events the facts are emerging that he let it happen  and look what its done for his ratings  look how patriotism and finding a convenient culprit albanians afghans talibans or osamas can play into schemes and plots of an illegitimate regimefor me this film has gone from merely poignant to quite chilling,black_comedy
if youre a hoffman fan like me then this is a must see he is simply magnificent in it his character an unappreciated so he thinks hollywood producer is perfect for him  he adds the exact amount of wit uncertainty spontaneity and unease that one would expect from someone if this insane plot were for real the president of the united states making it with a firefly girl come on  maybe a girl scout but even our presidents have their limit but hoffman takes us to the limit in this movie and sends us back he is so natural in this role you forget its him but thats hoffman at his best the other characters are good really good de niro is great as the man in the shadows who cleans up everyones messes heche is perfect as the somewhat nervous but always forward moving presidential assistant and even denis leary with a bit part as a movie stylist or something the fad king is a riot i mean with willie nelson belting out a madeforcover folk song how can you go wronghoffman rules,black_comedy
this was absolutely one of the best movies of 1998 and remains one of my favorites it is a perfect example of a film working in all aspects script acting directingname it its all done right the story begins during the current presidents reelection campaign and we are almost immediately swept into the behindthescenes look of things we soon learn that the president has been accused of sexual assault on a young girl enter conrad breendeniro his job is to find a way of keeping the american public distracted from that story as long as possible so he goes to hollywood superproducer stanley mottshoffman and together they will lead america to war are you interested yet hmmmmm still not sure what if i were to tell you that the war they have the public believing is going on in albania is actually all taking place on a hollywood sound stage yup its all been setup through press leaks gossip and fake video footage to make the president seemwellpresidential and believe me when i say that that is just the beginning of this fast and funny flick dustin hoffman received a well deserved oscar nomination for his performance in this film this being his second nomination under the direction of barry levinsonrain man deniro is equally fantastic in this film so funny and laid back a way i hadnt seen him since midnight run you will i promise love these performances even the supporting cast most notably anne heche as the frantic press secretary helping de niro and hoffman do what they got to do is perfect you cant take your eyes off it from beginning to end sometimes the film may seem a little impossible but it just looks so serious and believable that you will be second guessing yourself the whole way through much like the characters in the film even the final consequences leave you wondering about what goes on in your everyday life that you really dont know about by the end of this film you have not only experienced some funny and unbelievable situations but gotten to know the main characters in a personal way youll know exactly what motivates each one of these characters through this whole situation and exactly what they plan on getting out of this coverup i think that by the end of this movie you probably wont care much about the outcome of the presidential election but more of what these characters must now deal with i wont spoil it for you but this film definitely works and you will love it if you give it a chance so dont shy away from the political twists in this plot theres definitely nothing there you cant handle i think that anyone over the age of 13 with at least some kind of sense of humor will dig this flick then again even i enjoyed it,black_comedy
adapted from larry beinharts novel american hero this  seemed to be intended as an airy semipolitical comedy to me it just seemed like a lazily assembled collage of soft extended skits on engineering a media war you may notice several badly handled leaps in the story this is a muddled mess and it could have been such a great movie because its premise is exceptionalunfortunately de niro heche and hoffman three actors i really appreciate and the main reason why i watched this movie couldnt help it but then  what to do with such a script,black_comedy
a great performance from dustin hoffman in the lead and a quietly confident effort form di nero makes this an over looked comedy from 97 funny small roles from woody harrelson willie nelson william h macy  dennis leary if you like a smarter sorta comedy over the usuall crapthis is worth your time,black_comedy
most people know the plot of this outrageously funny movie by now a political spin doctor conrad brean robert de niro and a hollywood producer stanley motss dustin hoffman both well endowed with chutzpah set out to create the illusion that the usa has gone to war with albania as a distraction from a presidential sexual peccadillo made and released before the clintonlewinsky scandal broke it is not clear whether the movies makers had great insight or inside knowledge either way that episode adds to the interest and relevance of the film    de niro and hoffman are both brilliant though understandably the latter seems especially to relish lampooning a filmworld type he must have encountered many times in his career anne heche is just right as a presidential aide who previously thought she was streetwise but faced with brean and motss realises shes a tyro in the kidology game and woody harrelson has a wonderful role as the man picked to play the war hero who just happens to be a psychotic convict willy nelson is also in the movie apparently playing himself but in reality as a character called johnny dean he also wrote and performs some of the great songs including the stirring i guard the canadian border i guard the american dream  among the targets of the satire are clearly the us political establishment the broadcasting media and hollywood but there is a danger that the primary target may be overlooked and it is worthwhile remembering the derivation of the films title normally the dog wags the tail because the dogs smarter than the tail but if the tail was smarter it would and there can be little doubt that the dog being wagged by brean and motss is the viewing and voting public,black_comedy
is an intelligent satire and an interesting commentary on the media and how it could be and is used by governmentsare we suckers do we understand what really goes on in the political world we are fed lies the film brings up interesting questions this is one of the best satires in a long time the film has gutsthe acting is pretty good de niro and hoffman are reliable heche is good but dont expect anything new from leary harrelson is hilarious as the convictthe direction is good as is the screenplay although de niros character goes a little too quiet in the middle of the filmhas always see it in widescreen intelligent and fun well done,black_comedy
oh my dear goodness  id heard of this film when it came out andduringafter the monica thingie  last night this was on the tv so idecided to view itforget clinton leave that in the basement of your library  thisdeserves to be given status as eternal legend  we should especiallypeople of the us should view this film time and again just to remindourthemselves what the 21 inch box in front of you could be doing toyouan effective satire with capable performers taking us through youshall enjoy it  ill never see cnn the same way ever again ,black_comedy
one of the smartest and funniest satires ever made  truly bites the performances not surprisingly are brilliant  hoffman de niro  heche what did you expectthe screenplay is extremely funny the situations a little bizarre and exaggerated but hey its a satire  everything goes  as long as it resembles reality and is funy  and boy  does it ever work on both these countsthe fact that this movie reflected reality so much was a major turnoff for most people but leaving that aside its still a sharp and funny movie  well worth watching does get silly at times but hey  rent the movie ge some friends over and howl away to laughter singing along to good ole shoes a smart and witty 9,black_comedy
thinking mans comedy and one of the best at that robert de niro dustin hoffman at their best  never could understand how movies like this could get sidelined and not noticed  the movie is scary in a way because you wonder if the whole media hoodwinking the public thing is fictional or is it really happening ,black_comedy
this movie given the political events of the time may have had the most timelysome might say freaky and prophetic release date of any film  it features wonderful satire not only of politics but of culture and hollywood  but its greatest attributes are the performances especially those of de niro and hoffman which are simply outstanding and a pleasure to watch  i also loved the title and i thinks its a far better one than something more obvious or descriptive like the fake war or the spinmaster,black_comedy
a very wicked satire on hollywood politics and the supreme power of media spoilers q whats good about conjuring up a fake international crisis a it can distract the public from the real one and being fake its very easy to resolve moreover you can  do it without any loss of american lives which is always a big plus if one is concerned about the presidential approval ratings at first glance the very idea behind the movie seems ridiculous however it turned out to be so prophetic its freaky mr clinton and his advisors probably watched it to learn from the masters of course instead of an albanian village we had a sudaneese medical factory which was elevated to the status of a chemical weapons plant and promptly destroyed just in time to help the president ease off the impeachment pressures to be fair democrats werent the only ones to engage in such practices in fact what probably inspired the movie was the invasion of grenada conveniently launched while reagan was taking a huge hit on account of loosing all those american lives to a terrorist bomb in lebanonone might think that a film like would be too much tied to the politics of the moment  that it would loose all appeal a year past its release however ive just watched the film on tv and i liked it no less than when i watched in theater  few years ago in part this is due to a very snappy script and very good acting jobs by the lead actors  de niro heche and especially hoffman also woody harellson is simply hilarious as a paranoiac convict who is enlisted to play a role of a war hero of the albanian campaignthe movie is intentionally extremely cynical in the way it delivers its message and  some people might find that offensive but i believe it to be one of its major strengths my main complaint is that on a few occasions it pushes the boundaries of believability so far that it turns from satire to farce which i dont think it intended to be another drawback is that none of characters good or bad  well they are all bad is engaging enough to make you care at all about what happens to them thats why nobody is going to shed any tears for hoffmans character the most engaging of them all who gets killed in the end when it becomes apparent that he wants to disclose the whole affair in his vain desire to get recognitionhowever overall this is a pretty good film well worth your time to watch it,black_comedy
the point of the film is byandlarge how gullible the mainstream media is during the clinton years the powers that be could have said the sky was green  anyone who said otherwise a rightwing conspiracist  and basically the lapdog media corps would have marvelled at the spin  now we see just how much the clintonestas fooled the press and this film seems more like allegory than fantasy,black_comedy
this movie is an intelligent one its funny but it pops a few questions about todays governments and the manipulation of information its kind of freaky to see how its possible to create an entire story even a war from scratch and imagination i think we live these kind of situations every day but at a lower level dustin hoffman is excellent in this one7 out of 10,black_comedy
i thought the acting was great and the story was fun i think politics are boring but this movie held my interest several memorable oneliners amusing scenes and numerous fuzzy kittens all of which came together to make a great movie for smilingi thought it was ironic how this movie was clearly a comedy while the cast of characters within the movie is trying to film a drama as a result you find yourself laughing at several scenes within the movie which are completely dramatic to the audience within the movie it was strange and interestingmy only quibble is that it seemed to end rather abruptly and left a few loose ends dangling i was watching the television edit so its possible they were trying to cram it into an insufficient time slot im not sure,black_comedy
great to see hoffman  de niro together de niro is good but he could act parts like this one in his sleephoffman is great as the showbiz producer and this is one of his best roles in years the movie itself is perhaps too knowingly clever and the humor does seem contrived then again david mamets screenplays or his stage plays are not exactly known for their laugh contentpart of the problem with this movie is that the main characters are so annoying you do not care what misfortune awaits them woody harrelsons appearance late in the film adds greatly to the plot overall not bad but when you look at the sum of the talent involved barry levinson mamet de niro hoffman a bit of a disappointment,black_comedy
talk about prescience this movie was made before the clinton sex scandal broke and yet mimics the events surrounding the scandal almost too closely for comfortthe cast is wonderful the logic is delightfully nutty and the events are so crazy that we would never believe them if they hadnt actually played out in the real world or is it only what we think is the real world like the blair witch movies this film makes us consider the question of what is real and what is not what is genuine and what is hypehollywood politics spin doctors and human nature are all on display here and get royally satirized,black_comedy
referering to this comment earlier from another poster the film proves how easily the news can be manipulated and controlled in this movie there is no distinguishing borderline between fact and fiction the idea that anything seen or heard on the news might be a hoax the comical punch line of this movie may not be so funny after all   i dont think it showed that at allnow im not disputing one network couldnt try to make something up or get caught in a scandal about bending the news dateline proved that a few years ago  but theres a big difference between that and the government totally making up a war and 1000s of media outlets not figuring out its not really happening  i mean what network wouldnt want to expose it  what network wouldnt want to make the other networks look bad for chasing a fake story  they only showed one networks coverage of the war in the movie for good reason i guess cause thats about as plausable as it could really be,black_comedy
was an intriguing film about the pitfalls the usgovernment has to go through robert de niro and dustin hoffmanplay stan and conrad two film and government men who mustcreate a false war in order to divert the nations attentionaway from the presidents personal problems take a guess whatkind of problems they are with the help of a newswoman namedwinifred anne heche stan and conrad do the best they can tohelp our nation from falling on its face de niro hoffman andheche all do nice jobs in this political flick yet its prettyhard to follow on whats going on if youre not paying attentionto it the film can get a little tedious,black_comedy
i had high hopes for this supposed satire but i was greatly disappointed the entire movie was about as moving as a documentary on the manufacturing of bricks a satire is supposed to be a delicate blend of wit and disgust i was not able to find either in this movie i felt that the writing was flat and severely disjointed and this is from a huge mamet fan and the acting suffered from the stars being so in love with their aura that they were unable to act,black_comedy
this perfectly timed comedy which will be remembered if for nothing more than the fact that it came out just a reallife presidential sexscandal was breaking has all the right elements to guarantee its buoyancy for years to come  laugh after wild laugh is guaranteed while viewing this wild picture indeed it is one of those truly ingenious films which sticks with the viewer long after they have left the theater  woody harrelson is an absolute scream as the deranged sgt schumann  fabulous,black_comedy
i am generally a lover of dialogue driven films and i must say that this film is up there in my satire favorites  i think most people who disliked the film attempted to see the film as mostly a satire of the hollywoodwashington connection or as a satire about the corrupting power of the unknown handlers of a presidenton that score it is about a sixthere are films that do that betterbut i guess i saw it more of a satire of the sheer gullibility if there is such a word and blind patriotism of the american public  so much of what the handlers do is bought lock stock and barrel by the american public without question the scene with the shoes being thrown on the basketball court and all of the lines by deniro are just classic  add to that the music by willie nelson including one very hilarious lee greenwoodesque nauseatingly wrap yourself around the flag song entitled guard the american border guard the american dream and this film is just hysterical  granted i saw this film before the clinton scandal broke and saw it more of a satire linked to bush and the blind patriotism of the gulf war but seeing the parallels to the clinton administration is just plain eerie  even the brownie girl with whom the president in the film is alleged to have molested wears a beret as she gets hugged by the president  that is so weird it makes me wonder if perhaps david mamet and barry levinson and perhaps dustin hoffman and robert deniro knew more about lewinsky through their hollywood buddies than the rest of us in the gullible public at the time of production nonetheless this is a must see and i gave it a 10 despite the annoying anne heche who darn near ruins the film,black_comedy
excellent timed performances by deniro heche and hoffman raise this movie to orchestral proportionswatching is very much like listening to a good symphony,black_comedy
a white house intelligence team just before the election tries to distract the public attention from the presidents sex scandal by hiring a standout hollywood producer to create the impression of conflict then war in albaniawaspish and slightly bitchy political satire that became unexpectedly topical shortly after its release it has a certain elegance of wit but never really bites sharp enough and its gradual selfadulation and messy style leave little to impress afterwards,black_comedy
i thought this feature started a little slow the situation of the created war in albania as a distraction from presidential scandal was both quite accurate and believable but the film didnt seem to have quite the energy for the highpowered storyline set in the halls of power it could have been i was expecting it to be more like a thrillerturned satire but i suppose the formula was actualy quite a successful one in the end it grew on you as you watched and the characters slowly became more likeable progressing from corrupt men wholl stoop at nothing to corrupt men wholl still stoop at nothing but actually make it seem as if its the only logical thing to do and you forgive them for it,black_comedy
rated r 1 hour and 40 minutesa group of spindoctors plan to create a diversion to turn the americans attention away from a scandal aimed at the president just weeks before the election robert de niro plays conrad brean the intelligence of this group of con artists who produces the illusion along with the help of an assistant anne heche and a hollywood producer dustin hoffman brean thinks of the ideas and motss hoffman puts them into action together they succeed in fooling america and rigging the electionsthis movie has no doubt a very clever plot with many smart comical points but it also lacks the image that makes a movie what it is the characters are exceedingly shallow and in general it seems that all the trouble gone through to fake a war can be made easier if instead the efforts were put into helping the president make a new campaign slogan which is repeatedly made fun of throughout the film overall the ideas are acceptable yet the execution appears to have failedthough the movie seems full of humor and canny remarks the actual message expressed in is rather disturbing this poses the question if america can be deceived so easily at something as difficult to conduct as a war how would america react to a small scam made up the film proves how easily the news can be manipulated and controlled in this movie there is no distinguishing borderline between fact and fiction the idea that anything seen or heard on the news might be a hoax the comical punch line of this movie may not be so funny after alldirected by barry levinson also starring woody harrelson is a political satire which becomes less than satisfying,black_comedy
a political satire of a fake war between usa and albania directed by barry levinson this movie has a fine cast including deniro good as always hoffman at his finest with lines like this is nothing they are supported by funny performances by willien nelson and woody harrelson in a small role its very entertaining and classified as comedy although its not very suitable for fans of films like ace ventura and such its not that kind of laughyourselfoffyourseat movie but a friend of good acting or a fine script or a fan of dr strangelove should appreciate this i give it  out of ,black_comedy
is a funny and engrossing stylized political satire see bulworth for anyone who has not killed all of his brain cells i just saw the film although i had intended to see it during the theatrical release for those of you who were expecting a slack jaw comedy shame on you do your research before you fly off to see a film and maybe you wont be disappointed so often wtd is not meant to be realistic besides that is fairly impossible when ones intent is absolute and biting satire the only things that keep wtd out of the  to 12 category out of  is the calculated use of deniro and the disappointing finalefirst the casting of deniro was a highly obscene use of box office drawing power because of the superficial way in which his character is drawnwhich is to be expected in this kind of film anyone could havebeen wasted as conrad more than anything i suspect that deniro was paired with hoffman to increase tenfold any draw that hoffman would have achieved alone as the star of the filmbut what killed this film and all of its noteworthy effortso entertaining and thoughtprovoking a film on the cusp of greatnesswas the unforgivably lackluster ending the film is forced to end abruptly leaving the unsatisfied viewer in a stupified haze wondering after all weve been through how could it end like this unfortunately the writing talents of this film ran out of steam towards the end,black_comedy
i had high hopes for this movie  it had a cast i respect and came from the keyboard of a screenwriter i admire  the first half hour of the picture justified my hopes  the shot of dustin hoffman talking to the white house team from his tanning bed was very funny as were the manufactured songs and the arguments about the color of the fake bomb victims kittenstill boredom crept in midway through and by the end i had trouble concentrating  the movie lacked tension and as a substitute told jokes whose punch lines wed already heard  craig t nelsons character who was meant to be the opposition was nothing more than an occasional inconvenience who was certain to be conqueredi liked the ending which i wont spoil but i needed to feel that the stakes were higher  for the comedy to be entirely successful it had to make me just a little nervous  this movie was just too comfortable and settled for the easy jokes  i voted a six but i had gone in hoping for much more,black_comedy
given the situation one would think that by making movies about the real thing somebody would like you to think its not its amazing that this movie got made somebody up there is extremely farsighted clever and good in reality management what is the world we live in,black_comedy
is not the kind of movie that would entertain fans of armageddon that is to say that it is intelligent humour this is a skillfully written and directed oh yeah and produced film i enjoyed it the first time i saw it but after 2 subsequent viewings have discovered even more subtle gestures and comments that passed me by previously these further little additions add to an already witty and clever storyclearly two type of folk here show businesstypes and governmenttypes and the film pokes satirical fun at them both deniro recently and unjustly criticized for always playing the typical gangster goes another way with a fine performance as a spin doctor selling a gig to a bigtime hollywood producerhoffman once again show his versatility as the bighaired producer seeing oncoming problems as part of the gameheche does a great job as the onsite link to the white house while im not a huge fan i do give credit where its due ironic given the end of the movie,black_comedy
political satires have become the rage in american moviemaking and is clearly head and shoulders above the rest  first off  notice the fact that we never see a president when you see a glimpse he is outoffocus  this is important because this movie is attacking the position of a president and what costs an administration may go to ensuring success and good pr  director barry levinson and david mamet have used the allpowerful media to wag us and gives you the impression that we always have and always will be waggedthis film works so well because of the fantastic script but also because of the rich characters involved  de niro and hoffman have such juicy roles their characters even have their own trademark lines  hoffman this is nothing de niro im working on that  hoffmans producer is based on reallife producer robert evans allegedly and judging by how he plays him silly glasses veggie shakes they must not have seen eye to eye in the past  he deserved his oscar nomination and de niro inhabits conrad brean the fixer so well you almost long to have a job like his  create smokescreens from the hip that is what he is always working onthe supporting cast is highly memorable  heche is sexy and solid and denis leary as the fad king spills out his dialogue like a runaway train  so many reporters anchormen etc echoed this movie when clintons firefly incident hit the country just four months after its release  what the spin doctors do in cannot be that far off  i dont think they created a war however if they happened to do what hoffman and co do here why wouldnt we fall for it  our source is the media  we believe most of what we see de niro as brean is quick to point this out  in one scene he says the first draft of the warren commission says kennedy was killed by a drunk driver  would the public have bought it  who knows probablythe film flows smoothly and the witty dialogue and situations make you laugh  it is important because of its slanted accuracy to our current presidency and also slightly eerie  i guess after seeing it i wont believe all of what i see on the 6 oclock news,black_comedy
some movies have the special umpff that pushes it to the top this is a movie that didnt considering the amazing timing and the incredible coincidence of a president trying to cover up an affair with a young woman this movie could have ranked right up there with all the presidents men it only had to produced a riveting script it didntnevertheless it had good acting and looked great the usual suspension of belief is highly recommended,black_comedy
not living in the us i really wondered after seeing the movie how do you americans feel when after that you see president clinton bombing iraq in the middle of this way overblown sex scandal  it was interesting to read your comments here and i admit the movie makes you think a lot when you watch the news afterwards  i have always thought that journalists have way too much power because they control the information and today information is power  this movie confirmed my views,black_comedy
yes we did understand where others were coming from when comparing to bill clinton spin doctoring etc yes there are probably elements of truth about present circumstances and politics in general nevertheless we thought this was the film version of the emperors new clothes the film probably would have never achieved note if not for the present political situation we had heard the spin about the films relevance today but think the comments we heard must have been for the same reason as that of the citizens in the emperors new clothes  they wanted to appear sophisticated worldly intune etc did we enjoy the movie  not at all are we recommending it to others quite the opposite dont waste your money even for a rental recommend renting dave instead it is more insightful without being cynical more of a comedy and more worth the money,black_comedy
ive heard a lot of talk about this movie being severely unfunny this is not true  is an excellent look at the game of politics and how it filters into and is filtered by the film industry  dustin hoffman is the unflappable producer who is hired to avert the publics attention from a presidential sex scandal just before reelection and he looks like hes having so much fun with the part  the dialogue is crisp and witty no matter how many times youve seen it and the scene on the airplane with woody harrelson as a psycho is an instant classic in fact the entire film is an instant classic  if you know how to look at it,black_comedy
the dog can wag his tail but if the tail was smart enough the tail could that line or something similar to it is at the heart of wag the dogfor the movie its a plain satire  yeah you can see government agents and pr men hiring spin doctors and fabricating fantastic stories to get the president out of hot water  people getting so much into the fiction they make the fictions more important than realitybut is the satire entertaining  no not really  it blows the comedic moments and slugs along too much  its a good reflection of modern politics just not apt to be enjoyableas for how the movie relates to current events its amazing  see it if for nothing else than to compare to bill clintons current debacle  as the bombs began falling on iraq the day before the impeachment vote i had to ask myself reality is made into movies but did the movie get smart enough to make reality,black_comedy
wag the doghi my name is slim and i just saw a movie that damn near makes me want to move to someplace like mexico or russia where the government is corrupt everyone knows the government is corrupt and it aint no big deal when the government does something that is corrupt  but here in the good old usa we all like to believe our government isnt corrupt that it doesnt do corrupt things and if it does do something that is corrupt then heads will rollim talking about and sure it is supposed to be pure hollywood but you know its all just a bit too believable not to mention that it came out before gitalong bill and thar she blows monica became such a popular item  it almost makes you wonder that maybe there is some truth to it all and what we see is no way what it really is   anyway what we see in this film is the president getting in trouble with some young thing and so all these cloakanddagger government types start thinking they got to do something because the election is soon so they come up with the idea of a war but there wont really be a war just an illusion of one  so they hire this big shot hollywood producer to make up this illusion and they all get together and just hoodwink the whole gullible folks who are out there in american tv landwe got conspiracy theories we got statements on the stupidity of folks like you and me we got way too much similar stuff between the movie and reality we got yahoos acting like vips and finally we got the government being one big schemer liar deceiver and doer of ill deedsalmost three stars  go check it out then go register to vote so we can get a whole new bunch of crooks in because they cant be any worse than whats in washington nowel monte slim,black_comedy
i enjoyed this movie  it has an excellent cast and offers an interesting if somewhat cynical insight into spin doctoring that has become the centre of politics in the last decade  the back and forth between the deniro team and the presidential hopeful  the war is over no its not  makes for an interesting storyline,black_comedy
this film is a mirror of what happening now even though the war is real or is it it really makes you think really see this film with primary colors1998 to get your full feeding of political depictments,black_comedy
apparently a lot of people went to see this movie expecting either a highbrow comedy or a political farce  im sorry to inform you it was neither  was an expose i wish i were at liberty to tell you how close to the truth this movie is  and not just because it parallels bill and monicathe fact that so many of you just didnt get it is sobering testimony to just how important this film is  go see it again  for your own sakeyou have been warned,black_comedy
i dont care how many imbd voters call this movie boring i still love this movie it has many laughoutloud moments eg willy shuman on the plane  this is nothing the cast is great especially hoffman and deniro the film is very clever in how they never reveal much about the president anyone else catch the picture at the beginning that is a dead ringer to the famous clintonlewinsky picture,black_comedy
considering that it was made before levinskiclinton laundrycumproof epic unfolded and before the actual yugoslavian nato farce took place this movie looks like some serious prophetic stuffdustin hoffman delivers a striking performance the producers passion ambition desire for recognition emotionality and even a bit of naivet are brilliantly convincingde niro is less perfect im getting an impression that the only part the man has been getting to play lately is one of robert de niro himselfpolitically also makes a good point in a country where public seriously believes a president elected thanks to multimillion donations from corporations to be acting for the good of the public in a country whose foreign policys major feature is an unthinking demonization of any nation that strays across the path of any member of the current presidents corporate donors this should be refreshing in view of the latest enronbush scandal i shouldnt be surprized if a small positive war is to be fought soon in the middle east expect your shoe,black_comedy
unless you want to see some good actors totally wasted on what seems like an interesting premise but ends up entirely homogenized with a mediocre scriptseriously inane generalizations abound and after the movie was over i not only felt jipped but i wanted the nearly 2 hours back of my life that i lost to this movieremember though this is but one opinion people waste countless hours doing worse stuff other than watching a bad movie,black_comedy
dont be fooled this movie is not nearly as clever as some would have you believe  whilst the basic plot is interesting especially in the light of events over the last 45 years just doesnt deliver anything you are likely to believe would actually happen  this lack of credibility makes this film fail as a satireto make matters worse the acting is at best irritating  de niro plays that scruffy selfsatisfied character he plays when not cast as a gangster tedious and hoffman hobbles about like a man recovering from recent bilateral hip replacements whatever talent this guy had as an actor has long since deserted himfor me the ending couldnt come soon enough,black_comedy
this movie really sucks in spite the good actors i almost fell asleep while watching it and i wasnt tired at all this is one of the most boring movies ive ever seen it sounds great when you read the plot but the movie itself sucks the idea is great but the movie isnt even close to that so if youre thinking about renting it dont unless youre having sleeping problems,black_comedy
i couldnt finish this maximum gayness of a film  what a heap  this thing could have been two minutes long and it still would be a waste of time,black_comedy
this is a onejoke film that runs out of steam after about fifteen minutes the president is caught up in a sex scandal two weeks before the election and his special handler robert de niro is brought in to fix things up they decide to fake a war with albania with the help of a hollywood producer dustin hoffman  studio footage will be inserted into the news to create the illusion of a war so the publics attention is diverted from the scandaland thats it thats the whole movie except for the execution of the plan which isnt anything spectacular  the movie peaks way too early and they flog this simple idea for the last hour or so  and peak is a generous term because the comedy level never rises very high  de niro isnt funny  he doesnt understand the timing of comedy  hoffman is good but he cant carry the film because his character is onedimensionalthe whole thing is just plain dull  skip this one,black_comedy
amidst the accusations of president clintons sexual improprieties with intern monica lewinsky and others i cautiously hoped that the media frenzy and eerie parallels between the professional spin doctoring in this film and current headlines wouldnt jade my review  i can now rest assured  this film is mediocre no matter when you watch it  strip away the hype surrounding this exercise in hype generation and you have basic unchallenging fare  and its a shame because barry levinson has so much to work with  he even announces through robert deniros character his sources early in the movie reagans attack of grenada the secrecy surrounding the gulf war the symbolism without substance surrounding the images of iwo jima vietnam and latin america  with heightened technology our world is more abstract  we have very little tactile connection with global events amid the talk of a smaller world  however this abstraction is hardly new  theater has always presented the foreign in a tactile believable but frequently misleading way  before television and even mass printing methods many people were insulated to their own villages ripe to believe that the world was flat jews had horns and everyone else were barbaric buffoons  our myths are essential in shaping our world and ourselveswith such an intimate issue how could barry levinson go wrong perhaps his producer robert evans mirrored the dustin hoffman creation in his weaselly persona exuding a detached nonchalance while demanding ultimate control  either too many cooks were watering down the broth or an inexperienced chef was given the ladle  hoffman deniro and crew are trying to pull off the perfect crime treating the rest of us as accessories  the president needs a popularity boost in time for re election day after allegations surface regarding his private shenanigans with an underage firefly girl  needing to respond quickly the presidents closest advisors anne heche andrea martin and others employ the services of strategist conrad brean deniro who calls on a higher power in hollywood producer and general superman stanley motss hoffman  they concoct and film scenes from a fictitious war in albania and push americas collective buttons by evoking patriotism resolve bravery and all things presidential  to bolster the war effort their friend johnny green willie nelson writes and records a generically patriotic war anthem and convicted felon willie schumann woody harrelson is recruited to pose as the pow left behind a faceless populace provides massive support for the war effort and for schumanns rescue mission the joke here is that hollywood is ultimately controlling america  thats why politicians frequently exhort filmmakers to clean up their act for the childrens sake  less than half of eligible american citizens vote in the presidential race but nearly everyone goes to the movies  movies dominate our culture and shape public discourse  problem is the jokes inaccurate and not even that funny  democracy still reigns as diluted and imperfect as it is  if you dont get enough popular support or make enough money you cant attain gain acceptance in  washington or hollywood respectively americans may be gullible and occasionally downright stupid but we always question authority  levinson apparently believes that no one would bring up conspiracy theories in this scenario the conspiracy buffs would be drooling no one would contact anyone in albania or canada to verify facts no one would leak any information no reporter would probe deeper for the full story and no one would grow impatient with this spin teams stalling  america may be led by producers and spin doctors but its not controlled by themif this film is truly a mirrorimage of society the apocalypse is closer than we think  if this is meant to be an artistic representation of society it falls short  either way its a dubious footnote to americas political history,black_comedy
i saw this on video after finally giving credence to the barrage of hype and popular reviewsthis film is an utter disappointment and i hope mamet beinhart and henkin are never allowed to contaminate celluloid again mamets cardboard approach to character development was evident back in the unwatchable the untouchablesfrom talking to people who liked this at the time of its release the thing that touched a nerve was the topicality and fortunate timeliness subtract that and you have a dreary satirebynumbersthe heche and hoffman characters are ciphers and only de niro engages the interest everything else is simple wallpaper de niros dialogue is mildly interesting but its easy money to mine his past films and roles for metaironic lines as rocky and bullwinkle and analyze this or even meet the family proved most recently analyze this was truly funny but in general after twenty years its a welltired devicetiny spoiler to wit the point when hoffmann is agonising over the choice of animal prop and the the president interferes with creative input and hoffman mutters a curse about how typical this is gratuitously unsubtle areyougettingourpointyet posturinga better straight satire is eddie murphys distinguished gentleman i honestly cant recall seeing a decent twodimensional political drama since all the presidents men which was when hoffman must have been taking more professional pride in the scripts he accepted and that was back in 1976frankly i would love to have seen the massively underused genius john lithgow cast in the de niro role he does not get out enough in satirical mode these days a good man in africa traveling manand substitute frances mcdormand or sigourney weaver for heche but heches dialogue was not her fault and keanu reeves for hoffman its a onedimensional role requiring the ability to say uhhh and why or even denis leary or jarjar binks for that matterhyperironic and selfcommenting do not necessarily equal clever or amusing i fancy the wachowski brothers could handle it with more levityverdict a terrible waste of a potentially clever concept which died on mamets tooclever typewriter,black_comedy
inspired by some of clitons embarrassments this film hits a nerve however it never reaches the true potential of the inspiration  too over the top and get across as stupid  i wish they did more this film is flater than open 7 up out of the fridge for 3 day  410,black_comedy
this has got to be one of the worst films i have ever had the misfortune to watch it is so boring the only time i had a smile on my face was when i placed it back in the dvd case it was more interesting watching the time counter than this load of rubbishif you thought batman and robin was bad you wait until you see this you have been warned,black_comedy
they could have titled this movie watch a bunch of jerks talk on cell phones all day and it would have been just as effective  the pacing of this movie is all screwed up like the characters inane dialogue is more important than the structure of the movie  could have been much better,black_comedy
this film is one of the best action comedies i have ever seen the action begins from the first moment and keeps going throughout de niro is brilliant as bream the man with the plan who organizes the players from the start dustin hoffman is the witty but self absorbed producer who is constantly talking about his own successes every scene is well thought out and believable which makes it a wonderful mix of fantasy and reality anne heche is a great foil for de niros character denis leary is the pitchman willie nelson is the singersongwriter who is looking for the back end on his songs and andrea martin is perfect as the designer a political comedy that rings all too true in the world of today a must for any lover of de niro and a must for the serious collector language pill popping and a lot of innuendo make this a nono for the kiddies but your teens should see it for their future knowledge of the term spin doctor,black_comedy
a great cast a good story and tons of wasted potential should have been a classic but it isnt the satire in this movie is spot on and it seems to be becoming more relevant each day was it really released before bush days but the writing just isnt strong enough and barry levinson isnt good enough to pull the whole thing together more importantly it falls in the cracks between comedy and drama taking itself too seriously one moment and then not seriously enough the next yet its never actually funnytheres a lot to like here  especially thanks to the cast every dialog between de niro and hoffman  ill say it the two greatest american living actors  is sublime as is a brilliant cameo from willie nelson thats enough to make it entertaining but its not enough to make an impact youll enjoy the movie but you wont remember it and for that reason the point it makes is completely futile,black_comedy
i couldnt be less interested in politics generally in recent years more and more politicians are being shown up as unbelievably corrupt both financially and morally and that leads me to doubt almost everything that most of them say anywayreally doesnt help alter that beliefincredibly this was released the year before monica and bill played hide the cigar concerns the efforts of white house staff to conceal an indiscretion made by the incumbent president in the weeks before the presidential election robert de niro plays the white house equivalent of mr wolf from pulp fiction conrad brean his role is to bluff the media for just long enough to get past the election where the president never seen in the film had a massive lead in the polls at least before the incidentde niro and his team never pretend the president didnt commit the act  only that they must cover it up  so brean decides that the public will only be sufficiently be distracted by a misdemeanor this large by an even larger situation so brean and his team consult with a hollywood producer stanley motss dustin hoffman to see that they get one they do this by spreading rumours through various sources that the us security has been threatened by another country in this case albania and that america must band together to ward off this enemythis comes as a surprise to albania of course as no such peril exists but i guess that for a film such as this an element of farce is requiredis never especially funny there are a few chuckles to be had but the main pleasure is derived from some fairly smart dialogue and how the large team that is ultimately amassed deals with inconvenience and developments that arent in their favour of course being a movie nothing runs smoothly the cia and the opposition party see to that but it is how motss and brean adapt and react that provides the interestmotss is initially reluctant to help given that he wont get any public credit regardless of how the ploy works but as things develop his relentless positivity is pretty amusing it doesnt matter how bad things look he is still there saying this is nothing and coming up with yet another countermovede niro plays the straight man for much of the film to hoffmans egotistical hollywood bigwig but you sense he is not a man to be messed with and will do anything to make sure that his side winsas the credits were initially rolling my wife said something along the lines of wow everyone is in this and indeed the cast does boast kirstin dunst denis leary william h macy and woody harrelson as well as anne heche as breans loyal yet seemingly a little naive aidethe final third of the film contains some plot points that seem a little bit too extreme even for a satire such as this especially given the intricate planning and attention to detail given to early situations but overall what i went away thinking was well that seemed way over the top but no more than the lewinsky scandal and in my mind that is probably the most scary partstuff like this probably goes on in america way more than we realise and that we as the global public probably believe way more of what we are told than we should at timesfinal rating  65  10 ok as a film this is more a necessary reminder to us all not to believe everything that we hear in the media though while we live in a society that believes that the osbornes the kardashians and paris hilton really live like they do on tv this seems a pointless reminder if you liked this review or even if you didnt check out oneguyramblingcom,black_comedy
is one of those smart comedies thats not to say its an elitist brand of humor but it certainly doesnt have a mainstream appeal like physical or situational comedy its a witty concept comedy and the humor comes through characters and the humorous setup it doesnt exactly leave a profound impact on you either but its certainly a unique filmthe great concept for the film is that a dc pr guy for the president and a hollywood producer team up to distract the public from a presidential sex scandal that emerges just weeks before he is running for reelection they decide the best way to do it is by creating a fake war between the us and albania this alone holds a lot of promise and that promise in many ways is delivered thanks to the minds behind itfirst theres one of the writers famed playwright and screenwriter david mamet who gives the film its intellectual edge director barry levinson is much the same kind of director in his approach to comedy and certainly marquee actors dustin hoffman and robert deniro dont team up for just any old jokefest ill pretend meet the fockers hasnt come out yetstealing the show is really hoffman whose quirky if you can dream it you can do it mentality permeates the downtobusiness attitude of the other characters and scenes he keeps the humor of the whole situation in check with his requests for calico kittens and patriotic songs from willie nelsons charactermost interestingly you never see the president in the film hes not a character at allits entirely about the people behind him whereas the film could be written so you identify with the public its written to give you a secret little viewing room into the world of spinning the media it does seem a little exaggerated at times but its very unique among comedies its not supposed to make you laugh as much as grin sheepishly at the side of politics youre not seeing,black_comedy

just eleven days before the allimportant election the president of the united states becomes embroiled in a sexual harassment scandal involving a teenage girl in order to distract the voting public from the presidential scandal washington spin doctor conrad brean robert de niro hires hollywood producer stanley motss dustin hoffman to orchestrate a fake war against albania barry levinsons is a biting political satire and a wellhumoured exploration of the manipulation of the mass media and public opinion in american politics the screenplay was based loosely upon larry beinharts satirical conspiracy theory novel american hero which asserted that president george h w bush had completely concocted the gulf war david mamet was originally claimed to be the sole adapting screenwriter but hilary henkin took the films producers to court claiming otherwise ultimately henkin was awarded the top writing credit and the two shared an oscar nomination in 1998just a month after the film was released received a massive boost of public interest thanks to a startling coincidence in january of 1998 much like the presidential character in the film president bill clinton became involved in a disastrous sex scandal arising from his former relationship with 22yearold white house intern monica lewinsky over the course of 1998 and 1999 the united states engaged in three military ventures operation desert fox operation infinite reach and operation allied force each during pivotal moments throughout the scandal the events truly are an eerie example of real life echoing fiction  but then again perhaps clintons advisers had just sat down for a screening of the filmthe very idea of creating a convincing fake war is absolutely ridiculous but somehow a great cast makes it seem almost believable with de niro once again proving his comedic talent as the nononsense neversaydie presidential schemist a good plan today is better than a perfect plan tomorrow and hoffman terrific as the rich enthusiastic and creditstarved film producer did you know theres no academy award for producing hoffman would have been glad that despite not being nominated for a nonexistent producers oscar he did pick up a best actor in a leading role nomination for his excellent work hereperhaps it is because the film is based on a singular implausible premise but the film failed to entirely hold steam throughout its running time never really managing to keep pace with the hilarity of the opening minutes when de niro and hoffmans plan first begins to fall into place the film finishes on a rather uncharacteristic downbeat note perhaps levinsons means of bringing the audience back into the callous world of political deception and corruption after all whilst everybody involved appeared to have a grand time orchestrating a fictional war against the unfortunate nation of albania none of it is really a laughing matter at all,black_comedy
ten years on and it was time for a return to check out this show still great to watch and still great fun a lot of people miss the point of the show thinking its somehow about the us political system when its really all about hollywood and american entertainment the delusional hope of entertainers that somehow they are relevant and can make a difference and the way reality can be time shifted into a strange surreal landscape of sentimental schlock tearful speeches awful songs and video tricksbut hey thats nothing this is by far levinsons best film and dustin hoffman manages to mangle hollywood execs in fine style and the screwball pace of the dialog is handled by everyone else with style everybody who rants about the political nature of the show seems to overlook the fact that we never actually see the president its his opponent who gets the screen time and thats because the creative team want us to focus on hoffman and his ultimate fate the political system might shaft everyone in sight but hell he didnt get the credit if youve been in the game youll know thats the thing that really sticks in the craw everybody knows politics sucks and is just a subbranch of showbiz  thats old news for satire  but the real tragedy is that in showbiz youre never going to get the credit at least if youre the producer by the way who was the producer of the show did they have anything to do with iti look forward to seeing this show another ten years down the track and having a subtle laugh or ten if you havent seen it and have a nicely cynical frame of mind and a passing connection to the entertainment game what planet are you on but please check it out about the only thing that has much political relevance is that it feels good some folks in the states can sometimes get to make a show like this or thanks for smoking its about the only time you get the sense that democracy and freedom of speech might actually be a working workable concept ,black_comedy
i saw this film a few days ago and i have to say that i was let down while i did enjoy dustin hoffmans performance the performances delivered by the rest of the cast were not excellent and the movie as a whole tended to drag on see it but dont spend to much,black_comedy
i just watched this movie for a second time and it hit me at just how much poison there is in all forms of media  it begs the question of how much of what we see on tv is really a wellchoreograpped whopper  i think this movie is one of the best and honest political films of the last decade if not of all time  it recalled the near five by ten squared days we spent listening to the drivel of that mans sex life  it shouldnt have been public knowledge anyway it wasnt our concern  he should have admitted it and it would have gone away but that didnt happen and we have moved beyond ithere are my reasons and some spoilers maybe contained within 1 the main reason this movie worked was the performance of dustin hoffman  he was astonishing as the eccentric producer and his was the best performance of the film 2 i couldnt believe that i had seen both willy nelson and denis leary in the same film  both of them did exceptionally well the songwriter and fad man respectively 3 i never thought that woody harrelson could play a psychotic rapist  he was rather insane in the roll and he pulled it off 4 david mamet and hilary henkin both did an exceptional job in writing the screenplay  both of them have a nose from nasty poisonous tales think the spanish prisoner and romeo is bleeding 5 barry levinson is a good director watch sleepers for more proof 6 the title of the film is a perfect description of how i feel when i sometimes watch the news or read the newspaper  we are fed loads of bs each day and we have become complacent to it  the government is the tail it wags us everyday 7 i think this film fits the definition of black comedy  it makes your defense laugh go off and it doesnt apologize for it much like american beauty does 8 even more than a black comedy this was a nutty black comedy  the film had a very wacky feel to it  dustin hoffman kept using the defense line this is nothing even in situations that obviously meant something  the plane crash is the best example for this line of thought 9 this leads to the dichotomy of the film which i think was perfect black comedies have a poisonous feel to them  they get under your skin and are with you forever and you cant get rid of them  the poison or rather the remedy depending on how one thinks i believe remedy but all remedies have side effects is social awareness about how the media screws with the public and how we have become complacent to it 10 this was the perfect slam on our last head of state  i can still remember when he ordered those bombings on iraq while the scandal was going on  this is the bob roberts for the other party  ten reasons give a score of tenoverall this movie is scathing and caustic to say the least  it was wacky and nutty in a certain way but for the most part it was poisonous  it was like eating mallowfilled nut roll where the center was filled with a large dose of strychnine  i may be embellishing my description a bit but it felt like it to me  this movie hit closer to home since i had watched bob roberts before that  they are both masterpieces about the art of political deception no matter which party is in power  most of the news we get is imagery and nothing more  things that lack substance disturb me greatly and that is why i flip the news off after hearing the headlines because they are the substance  if you want true substance try the print media because at least it tries to spell things out  anyway if you can stomach the caustic flavor of  it is a perfect diatribe on mass media and political deception and it is best viewed along with bob roberts  here ends my rant,black_comedy
a witty script given to the right team can work wonders fortunately this film ended up with the perfect combination of de niro hoffman and director levinson helped with the pen of hilary henkin and the legendary david mamet who all brought this too close to the truth bone you may wonder if this film is far fetched overthetop or just plan silly but then again reality is sometimes stranger than fiction,black_comedy
based on r1 cdif your expecting sparks to fly between de niro and hoffman then your in for a little disappointment having said that the story is solid and many of the scenes will provoke a hearty belly laugh from the cynicsfive years on this movie has a lot more going for it than in 1997,black_comedy
levinson once such a fine naturalistic director seems to have come unstuck with this film the signs werent good with sleepers and was a bigger disappointment whilst a good comedy satire such as the player or dr strangelove allows the viewer to feel involved without being pushy wag is relentless in making sure you get the joke  its too claustrophobic the visual style is too hurried and is trying to hard to come across as naturalistic and instead becomes intrusive and annoyingbut there are some good gags and hoffman and de niro do well with under  written roles sadly heche the most under used actress in hollywood struggles with dialogue that mamet tries to convince us we all really useoh and the ending and this may be a spoiler but probably not is badly handled with the tone and rhythm of the film disturbed not that ive got anything against shifts in tone  la confidential does it brilliantly but seems to stick the ending on for no important reason other than to tell us were being serious 6 out of 10,black_comedy
this is a very well produced movie the pace is fast and the script is by far one of the most original to come on screen in a while the acting is superb and the title that opener about the dog and the tail is one of the best ive seen it immediately captures your attention at the crucial beginning although i generally find dark comedy quite watchable i had problems with this one i think to really enjoy this movie you need to get over the selfishness and lack of ethics from almost all of the characters i found them all to be extremely deplorable and in the end that kind of soured the movie for me hoffman is at his best here as is de niro and surprisingly heche too,black_comedy
judging from the imdb rating this movie has garnered i can only assume that most of imdbs raters are those who are easily bored if 10 minutes go by without something blowing up  if youre not one of those action movie junkies then you might just love this movieit has some of the best and funniest dialog of any movie of the late 90s the acting is fantastic  rare in an age when acting normally means trying to look frightened while staring at a blue screen where the special effects will gothis movie definitely isnt comparable to movies like independence day or airforce one but fortunately that means it isnt comparable to independence day or air force one  definitely not for the faint of mind,black_comedy
is a funny and engrossing stylized political satire see bulworth for anyone who has not killed all of his brain cells i just saw the film although i had intended to see it during the theatrical release for those of you who were expecting a slack jaw comedy shame on you do your research before you fly off to see a film and maybe you wont be disappointed so often wtd is not meant to be realistic besides that is fairly impossible when ones intent is absolute and biting satire the only things that keep wtd out of the  to 12 category out of  is the calculated use of deniro and the disappointing finalethe casting of deniro was a highly obscene use of box office drawing power because of the superficial way in which his character is drawn which is to be expected in this kind of film anyone could have been wasted as conrad more than anything i suspect that deniro was paired with hoffman to increase tenfold any draw that hoffman would have achieved alone as the star of the filmbut what killed this film and all of its noteworthy effortso entertaining and thoughtprovoking a film on the cusp of greatnesswas the unforgivably lackluster ending unfortunately the writing talents of this film ran out along with its credibility towards the end,black_comedy
is too familiar and simple and the general public is too sophisticated these days to fall for trite cinema that falls apart too easily like a soiled diaper familiar but who wants the smell ive been given reports probably untrue that the film is really a remake of a hoffman home video the cast and director simply can not pull off this impostor of a filmthe camera moves here and there no story outside the immediate scene no substance just burlesque i shook my head in sadness even the 800 number shown on screen is bogus 8005550199 you might as well see the camera everyone knows any phone number except the last four digits containing 555 is a dead giveaway what are we idiots its not real sure we know but do we have to be constantly remindedis dull stupid and boring and it insults our intelligence go ahead see it siskel and ebert gave it two thumbs up way up sure the story idea was interesting i looked forward to it seemed like great fun i dont see a film just to review it but this film would work only if one could believe the premise either it was real or it was a big joke its embarrassing for all involved petty story disguised as art,black_comedy
starts out limping and finishes lame apparently written as farce but directed as satire it left me cold i rented it to watch with friends and so had to suffer their dirty looks and muttering for the durationas a farce it fails because of its direction too straight and too slow the viewer is given way too much time to see the stupidity of the situations which develop it it was condensed into an hour with a dash of comic violence thrown in it may have been funas a satire it also falls short ultimately because there is nothing believable about it the story lacks subtlety and i got a real sense that the occasional unfinished sentence ala mamet i presume was not for realism but because there really was nothing interesting to say the theme of a manipulative media is hardly new just go watch network or broadcast news again they both go much deeper and youll learn and laugh a lot more the treatment of the media campaign in is over simplified telling even the most naive viewer what they already knowif you want good political satire rent primary colours if you want selfreferential hollywood satire see the player or get shorty perhaps is actually a farcical parody of the medias hamfisted attempt to satirize itself whatever it is i dont get it,black_comedy
let me start by saying that this was a very good movie now much has been made of its classification as a comedy it may not be a laugh out loud type of film although i did on a couple of occasions but it is witty fun and satirical i have seen many movies classed as comedies where i didnt even crack a smile people have also mentioned some requirement for genius iq to get this movie i would dispute that but at the same time i would say that i may well have enjoyed this movie more because my degree and work is in politics the story itself is uncanny it was been a well known principle that wars are good for poor polls it is just even more obvious nowadays the degree of media manipulation may be pushing things a bit far but it is scary that control of information and picturesie desert storm colours our perceptions so greatly generally this movie preaches that people will believe what they are told and hate whom theyre told to hate unfortunately theres a lot of truth in that i thought the acting superb especially hoffman even heche whom ive thought poorly of since six days seven nights  terrible movie put in a classy job and deniro was his usual quality actor lastly anyone who thinks primary colors a superior movie well i will say no more except maybe you should stick to van damme movies from now on,black_comedy
its funny to see how this movie has garnered polarized responses  from those who loved it and conversely those who didnt get it  i personally thought that it was hilarious  yes it does require some prior knowledge of politics and current events  and for that reason i dont recommend it to everyone  the humor is subtle and as i can testify first hand there were numerous times when i laughed hysterically while everyone else sat deadpanboring  no  thoughtprovoking  absolutely  and for that reason i think a lot of people will not like this movie particularly after all of the press it received recently as the presidents problems could not have been any more parallel to the events of the filmi strongly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch a movie that lets them to think as they laugh  otherwise watch the wedding singer and laugh because they have a rubiks cube,black_comedy
people who want to sit down and have a nice neat story poured into their heads will hate this movie  on the other hand if you like political satire this movie will make you laugh and cringe in fear  hoffman and deniro are brilliant  my favorite exchange deniro referring to the gulf war shot of a laserguided bomb blowing up a building says something like i was there when they filmed it  it was a 14 scale model  hoffman says is that really true  deniro smiles and says whos to say,black_comedy
many people have said that is a boring movie many have said its too brainy well i agree for those who cannot comprehend the subtleties it must be excruciating for the rest of us it is a fantastically sharp satire with quick jabs and an aura that makes you fear the possibilities for real life you cant get any better than de niro hoffman and such wonderful additions as denis leary and a surprisingly funny willie nelson make the cast one of the best in years david mamet is again masterful with his insight into the political realm and the music though not exceptionally powerful is appropriate,black_comedy
this movie was one of those movies that i thought i would have to like because the critics with whom i usually agree said it was so good other examples of critics praising boring movies are the last emperor the english patient and pulp fiction the acting in was great but good acting cannot subsitute for a boring story line,black_comedy
right after this movie was released the affair between billy and moni broke out and there were suddenly problems with the middle east hum hum so it may not be about that but its pretty close when the president gets caught in a sex scandal its up to robert deniro anne heche and dustin hoffman brilliant as the hollywood producer to create a fake war with albania it was very funny to see how the whole scam was planned in the very detail for a great rental i recommend it,black_comedy
this has got to be one of the worst films ive ever paid to see i almost fell asleep watching it  do not watch this rubbish no basic story line and ham acting throughout im sure mr deniro and mr hoffman would like to forget this one one question  why make such meaningless drivel when the performers have done so much better and mrlevinson again why ,black_comedy
this is another one of those movies that people insist is clever and politically astute and isnt the number of big stars in the film doesnt make it any better and quite frankly im ashamed of them for being in it  i say this as a tremendous robert deniro fan this is the type of film that only hollywood elites find clever the types that think everyone between la and new york are a bunch of rubes picking lice off one anothera brief outline of the plot the president is caught in a sex scandal  this film was released in 1997 mind you one of his spin doctorsrobert deniro seeks to save face he enlists the help of a eccentric film directordustin hoffman to produce a fake war they pick an obscure country that most americans have probably never heard of albania the presidents popularity surges the phony war helps bury the scandal and gets him elected  before us rubes find out i dont want to get political well the film tries to so maybe i willlet me start out with one of the tremendous flaws of this film it views clintons airstrikes of iraq as a cover for his sex scandal i need to introduce a big problem with this and how overly concerned with political correctness clinton was he also could have ordered the cia to take out osamba binladen yet cowered to political pressure of the possibility of looking bad for attacking people if he had the same types of people would have levied the same criticism on him not realizing how important it would have beenif you want to say this is revisionist history fine hindsight is 2020 but i hated this film when it was released i felt it was insulting and inaccurate then for other reasons news coverage over the past ten years is rampant cnn reports on deployments of us military everywhere when ever they move wrongly in my opinion the concept of a fake war that the american people will believe just because its on tv is ridiculous the only time the us uses immediate force without debate negotiations un votes congressional votes etc is when its doing so covertly think about the large antiwar build up and protests for the current or second iraq war the makers of this film have to much faith in government and not enough in the common man this very republic was founded on a revolutionary concept elective representation i just have a little more faith in us lice picking the world is flat rubesaside from the political and back to the film to its credit it has two fairly memorable performances dustin hoffman and woody harrelson its a highly watchable film with good dialog and bits of comedy scattered throughout but you can see all the stars in much better films i really think this film is vastly overrated i hope some people will look back and realize that it is i like most of the actors and recommend them highly in other films if youre interested films that are politically astute and deal with real situations instead of pseudo ones i recommend all the presidents mena good hoffman film the candidateslightly dated but still better than this or hotel rawandaa great film,black_comedy
woah woah woah im seeing the term brilliant satire being tossed around in these reviews far too much i think i saw a comparison to dr strangelove i hope kubrick hunts you down and punches you in the facethis was one of the worst movies ive ever seenas for plot it is essentially the same thing as canadian bacon 2 years prior imo infinitely times funnier and smarter than this which is not necessarily a bad thing if it werent so haphazardly thrown togetherthe movie begins a bit in medias res and awkwardly introduces you to the situation and this albanian idea without a single laugh robert di nero who i usually like is clearly just playing a poorly developed caricature of himself dennis hoffman who i love is occasionally good for a chuckle but the whole producer persona and dialogue just gets old boring and unrelatable after the first scene and then theres this who are you anne heche character whos only purpose in the story is to praise di neros character for his brilliance cause hes not actually brilliant o trolololol thats hilarious then these characters who we could not care less about or relate to go on a bunch of farcical adventures which would usually be a dynamite recipe for comedy but again we just dont care about or even understand these characters and their motivations overall this movie might not be the worst satire ever but it certainly is an awful movie  proof that good actors and a good idea cannot make up for a hideous screen play,black_comedy
was really a dog of a film the idea behind the film was amazing and probably sounded pretty flash at an ideas meeting at the studio but the script was pretty thin and the acting was a bit too selfindulgent and not particularly notablesometimes i felt that the plot line was rushed or perhaps they had a vague outline of how the story would play out but filled it in on the gothis wasnt really a comedy either as it lacked lines and scene that made you laugh it was more like an amusing film to those who liked it but ultimately i didnt find it very amusing either after a while it became fairly tediousthe film was well received by those who believe that government spin is so strong that their theories and perception borders on silly and conspiratorial but for everyone else it didnt offer us much,black_comedy
its not that i necessarily disagree with the politics its more that levinsons film is proof that satirical films should be left to people on the fringes of the film industry dont even get me started on hoffman and deniros performances hoffman especially radiates an unbecoming smugness only rivalled by the directors own,black_comedy
the us president has just been exposed in a sex scandal not long before the next election spin doctor conrad brean robert deniro teaming up with hollywood producer stanley motss dustin hoffman to fabricate a war so as to distract the country from the presidents sexual folliesthere are several badly handled leaps in the story and the movie lacked tension the acting is pretty good de niro and hoffman are reliable heche is outstanding and even harrelson is fun to watcha great cast a good story should have been a classic but it isnt the satire in this movie is spot on but the writing just isnt strong enough and the production looks cheap,black_comedy
if youve come across any of my other reviews of barry levinson movies youll know that im not a fan so it probably wont come as a surprise to you that i didnt think much of a good cast  robert de niro dustin hoffman and anne heche are the three principals  is assembled for a vague and unfocused satire on american politics and movie making hoffman received his 7th academy award nomination for playing an eccentric hollywood producer  by most accounts a parody of robert evans  but it feels like an inside joke that the vast majority of the moviegoing audience isnt going to get the movies not funny enough to be successful as a laugh vehicle not sharp enough to be effective as satire and not compelling enough to work in any other waygrade c,black_comedy
log line a hollywood producer a washington spindoctor when they get together they can make you believe anything produced and directed by barry levinson and written by hilary henkin and david mamet this film is best known for its timing by a stroke of luck for the producers and distributors its release coincided with the outbreak of hostilities against saddam following hot on the heels of the revelation of president clintons involvement with monica lewinsky spooky the blurb on the video box reads as follows when the president of the united states is caught in a scandal just two weeks before the election its up to his white house adviser ronnie brean robert de niro to clean up the mess ronnie joins forces with hollywood producer stan moss dustin hoffman to divert the countrys attention from the presidents crime they decide that what is needed to stop the media spotlight is a war but lacking a real war they fake one actresses play pretty refugees and rock stars record stirring hit songs about freedom soon america is rallying round the president but trouble arrives when and rough and tough senator gets wise to the pairs tricks meanwhile election day gets closer and closer very odd its a perfectly reasonable summary until the penultimate sentence having just watched the film i can say without fear of contradiction that there is no rough and tough senator who discovers whats going on was this an alternative plotline that was abandoned this wouldnt surprise me because the last act is rather weak the cia wrecks the war story by announcing an end to the imaginary hostilities but hoffman and de niro undeterred come up with a soldier trapped behind enemy lines its from this point on that the drama flags schuman the imaginary soldier turns out to be a psychotic military prisoner the plane supposedly carrying him home crashes a very odd sequence because one minute theyre flying through a storm and the next our stars are standing apparently unharmed in the middle of the wreckage  i dont think so and then schuman tries to attack a girl at the farm on which they end up the farmer shoots him and the plan has to change again  hell be brought home in a coffin with full military honours then in the end sequence hoffman decides that its all been so successful that he has to have a credit as far as hes concerned this is the greatest thing hes ever produced and he wants everyone to know that he did it  as he points out theres no academy award for producing hes insistent and as he leaves we see de niro indicating to the security men the next thing we see is the tv announcement that hoffman has died from a heart attack at the age of 58 or 62 depending on the buyout nice gag but its not really a satisfying payoff i suspect that the real problem is that lack of a third act the end of act two should really have been the discovery of the truth by that rough and tough senator with act three posing the really big problem of how they get out of that mess as structured here each complication is only ever an act two buildup  the problems change but they dont really advance the plot its like the same joke told in different ways it would be interesting to find out what happened to that elusive senator an afterthought this makes an interesting comparison with primary colours which although less overtly funny and farcical did at least try to make some kind of intellectual engagement with its subject never at any point in is the subject of lying in politics for the greater good ever brought into focus on the video box the times in london is quoted as calling the film a treat bright and intelligent but surely its not ive reached the conclusion that film critics only refer to the intelligence of a film in a direct and inverse proportion to their own knowledge and understanding of the subject in other words the times critic knows nothing about white house politics so to him obviously it appears intelligent or am i just being cynical,black_comedy
it may have been a clever idea but is not a clever movie no matter what its creators think instead its tedious and insulting would that it were not sorobert deniro as a political fixer dustin hoffman as a hollywood producer and anne heche as a ninnyish white house aide create a hoax war to distract the nation from a presidential sex scandal in the runup to election daydespite some snappy dialogue here and there the movie fails because it it cant decide if its a political slapstick like woody allens bananas or a chilling indictment of political system gone wrong like the candidate or bob roberts a vastly better moviethe cast take a variety of approaches to this problem deniro plays confident but never chooses a route hoffman goes slapstick and saves his own skin so does woody harrelson who wisely plays his role as a dangerous convict as if hes in police academy xiv heche appears confused directionless and not up to the taskit looks as if barry levinson wanted to use big names and slapstick to lure in the masses so they would see how they are being manipulated  to expose political fraud for the benefit of the presumably benighted while satirizing it for the amusement of the presumably clever no wonder its a guaranteed box office flop the public doesnt want to be told how idiotic and gullible it is  especially when the perpetrators of the elaborate hoax are shown as such incompetents if hollywood cant make a convincing movie about a fake war how are we supposed to believe it could make a convincing fake warthe reality is that the people running the real show in the us are sometimes scarily competent and they have more resources at their disposal than are shown in this movie as deniros character points out the us invaded grenada less than 24 hours after the disastrous truckbombing in lebanon which more than 200 us marines were killedthey dont throw phony wars  its easier to throw real ones,black_comedy
a film by barry levinson bandits rain man  good morning vietnam has an original concept however fails to deliver the poignant and dynamic effect it should create on the viewerwhen the president of the united states becomes involved in a sex scandal just a week before the election a spin doctor robert de niro is called in to fix the problem he sees that the only way to divert the publics and more importantly the medias attention away from the presidents scandal is to create a fake war however creating an artificial war isnt an easy task so de niros character conrad brean goes about finding a famous hollywood movie producer stanley motss dustin hoffman hoffman and de niro are both brilliant as usual however as the film unfolds the tail becomes more and more unrealistic while the script fails to captivate the viewer and produce the strongly compelling effect which the plot should create all in all is an original quirky well acted and slightly funny film however is nothing brilliant 610,black_comedy
i found this movie to be funny boring confusing sloppy and brilliant its worth seeing but its not a  big deal  i wont think about it every time i watch the news because this could never happen but it is interesting as a movie  woody harrelson was great and hoffman deserved his oscar nomination,black_comedy
the premise of the movie was rather interesting at least it seemed to have a certain potential but the treatment operated by barry levinson it totally disappointingindeed he delivered this story both amusing and highly improbable with no conviction and in a total linearity when it could have been a lot more impacting you never get caught up in the game of those two spin doctors because everything is delivered in a monotone way from start to finish with no variation of tone nor rhythm and the movie therefore appears as absolutely soullessto make things worse the photography is cheap as hell and gives the impression youre watching an old tv movie from the 90s not to mention some doubtful choices regarding cinematographyin the end you can only regret the waste of the two talents that are dustin hoffman and robert de niro in this anecdotal feature,black_comedy
the movie while the story itself could have made for a great show had another crew produced it was the first in a long time that i had trouble sitting through it did indeed become incredibly boring near the end but thats not really enough to disappoint me this badly what really bothered me was the amateurish quality of the filmography  in the credits there is a thankyou to those responsible for filming the movie in just 30 days well it shows microphones in every shot inadequate lighting fast shaky zooms indicative to subject tests seems that every spare scrap of underexposed footage went into this poor production i want my money back,black_comedy
i think its again a beautiful example of the hypocrisy of this economic and political system everybody knows about certain abuses but nobody resists them dont you americans never think of a better society of course a lot is exagerrated in that film but it is true that certain people can just make a war for political or economical reasons the film itself technically seen also is typical american the complete sterile camerastyle which you can see in most hollywood movies is it impossible for american cineasts to find a more creative way of filming,black_comedy
the rock that hands the cradle the whack that tails the dog and the viewer that has watched what probably could pass as one of the most emptyheaded and dishonestly intelligent pieces of cinema of all timebut perhaps im being unfair cause when i saw this sorry excuse for a movie i must admit i actually ws moved ie my feet dragged me to the exitsign that shone like a beacon of hope in a very dark place i cannot even say it was a bad movie the ring2 is a bad movie and horribly so but this was beyond bad it was a nonevent a black hole of senseless stupidity trying now to remember what i witnessed that evening somewhere in the late 90s there are two things i really dont understand about this sort of movies first of all i dont understand how anyone cn make a film like that second why someone who does make such a thing is at all capable of nt hanging himself the very evening he sees it finishedi watched the thing with two old friends in holland netherlands we had ran into one another just a few days before when i left the theatre about halfway into this waste of celluloid they where shocked at my decision to turn my back on such intelligent a film i was appalled they stayed in we parted ways and have never seen or spoken each other sinceone must at least have some first principals when it comes to cinema  1 out of 10 is even way too generous should be zero just zero,black_comedy
this has got to be one of the worst films ive ever seen the idea was great but the movie was boring to deathdo not i repeat do not watch it,black_comedy
even though it does have the godlike presence of mr de niro this film is a waste of money do not buy it at all costs i did and i regret it,black_comedy
on the second viewing this films weaknesses are openly exposed the first time around it was fair the second time quite a bore the main problem is in the characterisation of the leading players they are dustin hoffman as stanley motss robert de niro as conrad brean and anne heche as winifred ames fair enough so farin a kind of vague reference to the rainman character dustin hoffman takes neurosis to some reasonably and irritatingly high levels i understood what they were going for here but he just kind of took it to one place and left it there besides which he wasnt greatly convincing and his spasm at the end seemed to come out of nowhere conrad is potentially one of de niros most interesting postnineteenseventies characters however he drifted to and from the original portrayal so badly that i was confused as to what he was going for i sensed some muddy direction for him however he did save this picture from being as dull as it might of been typically he is convincing and a pleasure to studyand anne heche as winifred ames was annoyingtothemax i wondered after watching this is she ever has or does have a fan base as easy as it might be to look up on site such as this i still cannot be bothered to even checklike some very good films the story element is very simple however like most terrible films too the story is very simple and the narrative is mostly delivered through a million overheard phone calls it makes its point fairly early on which is appreciated but it just keeps running with that for the 97 mins and yes i do believe that a government would do certain things to preserve its authority thanks for enlightening me barry levinson,black_comedy
i watched this film after reallife events overtook and passed its thematic content and went into it expecting good things given barry levinson directed and with that cast  but apart from a stellar performance from deniro and a good one from dustin hoffman nothing seemed to click  the supporting cast is more or less wasted and portions of the film are so over the top that the movie lurches from satire to farce and back again  i saw the ending from a mile away  the worst sin is that for me none of this was for one second credible  although outsde events may have had something to do with my reaction the principal problem was that the opponent isnt even near to being a threat to us on their best day  i buy the conspiracy theory but i dont think even h l mencken would think the american public capable of swallowing this and he once said no one has ever gone broke underestimating the american public  while a good movie it could have been so much better  sigh,black_comedy
the president is up for reelection and he gets caught in a sex scandal with a young girl what to do after a lot of talk among his staff they rope in hollywood people to create a completely phony war in albania to distract public attention using artificial mediasounds hokey well yes the movie refers to reagans military invasion of the island nation of grenada shortly after a terrorist bomb killed hundreds of us troops stationed in beirut the claim being that reagan was trying to distract the public from the troops being killed never mind that the grenada invasion was real and certainly did not distract the news media from the beirut bombing also even in the days when the internet wasnt widely used theres no way a completely fictional military action would not have been exposed shortly afterwardbut the movie does allow for that they then use a convicted dangerous felon to play a soldier left behind in the supposed war which would distract the public anewif you can believe that a completely fictional military action would be widely reported in the major news media and somebody not quickly reveal the hoax for what it is this movie might be for you,black_comedy
when this movie came out the republicans were laughing at bill clinton for taking terrorism seriously  the premise of the film is that clinton invented kosovo like terrorism to cover up news stories about his sex life now thanks to clark we know that republicans went on thinking terrorism was something clinton made up right up until 911  the movie sure looks different now  just evaluating the movie as a movie it is too silly to be interesting as paranoid fantasy and too serious to be funny  it was just another propaganda effort to ridicule bill clinton for giving us eight years of peace prosperity and a balanced budget  it reminds me of a great line in neal stephensons quicksilver about how the english liked to make fun of the dutch for being free honest and hardworking,black_comedy
this movie actually makes the viewer think from beginning to end which is not something all movies aim forit makes you think about your role as a citizen and the things you are fed by the mediain fact this movie could be seen as the first examples of this questioning furthermore the movie is a success in combining filming with politics other than these two aspectspersonally i didnt find the film very interesting this could be due to erosion of time on this movie other than that though it wasnt very fun to watch because it was all too predictable and corny like the presidents speech so the only case i would recommend to watch this movie is if you are told to by your film teacher as was the case with me,black_comedy
david mamet is a master writer and his script cowritten with hilary henkin for is a great one filled with the rapid fire dialogue that anyone familiar with his work would expect where the film goes wrong i think is in barry levinsons tone who opts for a light and comedic approach to the potentially biting satire of the storythe plot revolves around a spindoctor and hollywood producer who team up to fake a war in order to distract the nation and get the president reelected this is a topic that is ripe for sharp social and political commentary and the script goes in that direction plenty of times but i feel like the tone of the picture takes things far too easy on the potentially brilliant themes of it all they go for comedy so often and i didnt even consider laughing once during the film but instead was just hoping that there would be more dramatic sceneswith actors like dustin hoffman and robert de niro in the lead roles the opportunity was right in their palms to make something edgy intelligent and razorsharp but they justdidnt go for it what came out was a lackluster comedy with no laughs hoffman adds more weight to his character than the rest of the film has going for it imbuing his producer with a vanity and remorseful quality that is interesting to watch but he only gets the opportunity to really do anything with it once and its easily the finest scene in the filmde niro is someone ive never been a fan of but i didnt mind him much here mostly thanks to his chemistry with hoffman the two work well together and mamets script has the opportunity to sizzle if only a stronger director had gotten the reins of it i can only imagine what the film could have been if mamet himself had sat behind the camera,black_comedy
first off let me say this is dark black black humor in this movie but its very very funny ill give it that and its fun while its running mostly due to dustin hoffmans performanceits a performance dripping with irony and laced with bitterness to its core and yet its somehow till fun to watch not to mention hilarious the de nirohoffman pairing is definitely somewhat thankless for de niro but surprisingly hes a solid straight manis an extremely amusing movie it suffers when hoffman is off screen and sometimes the plot holes gape none the less its thought provoking to say the least and wickedly entertaining on the other hand i cant remember the last time i came out of a movie feeling worse so go figure,black_comedy
all i can say is this is very close to home think about it i love film and movie magic but just imagine these days what you dont see via your own eyesfirst hand may not be what is a greenblue screen and some hype for the masses and ya got sheer panic and chaos so we can say for the sake of argument newspaper tv radio and all that can be consider mediacan be taken with a grain of salt it is that simple i applaud the executives and producers for going the distance gets a 10 politic statssome may scream while others dream but more often things arent what they seem,black_comedy
these are the movies that open our eyes  america  with the help of freuds nephew that was hitlers main producer for selling the ww2 to the german people  learned how to sell its own garbage to the american people and the whole world  yes  after ww2  freuds nephew was employed by the pentagon for more than 20 years  he is the one that sold the dismantling of yugoslavia into 6 countries that are still raging social wars just because the usa was afraid by the fact that yugoslavia and romania could be presented as good examples of perfectly functional socialist economies  after working for hitler  he was taken under the wing of the pentagon to help them sell everything like korea  vietnam  yugoslavia  iraq i  etc  in real life  he was the producer don believe the lies that the tv is selling you  do your own research  this is the tv they want you to believe is impartial  nbc national broadcasting company is owned by general electric abc american broadcasting company is owned by disney cbs columbia broadcasting system is owned by viacom and cnn cable news network is owned by aol america online time warnerthere is no free press  if you are against them they shut your whole life down  you cant go and say these for real and these facts must be disguised in movies otherwise any actorproducerdirector might end up like charlie sheen ps read the book confessions of an economic hit man by john perkins ,black_comedy
not only was this movie a satire on politics but it tied in big budget hollywood as wellsome say this movie is slow and boring and they are wrong this is a film that takes the proper amount of time to develop everything it doessome say this is a ridiculous film and they are 100 correct this is satiresatire is an exaggeration and is aimed to be ridiculous to prove a point gullivers travels anybody great satirethis is a film that knows what it is and what it wants to say and it does a great job of it all the while you get to see two great hollywood actors with amazing chemistryand for the people who have the seen the moviethe producers of this film were great too haha,black_comedy
by that i mean in real life were the president to try to spin favorable poll numbers by creating a phony war in the media the cia would be in the loop indeed the cia would be the loopthats the fascinating premise of this decadeold clintonera satire of what the rich and powerful friends of the president can do these days if the president gets in trouble in the movie the clintonlike potus president of the united states is accused of enticing an underage firefly girl a girl scout analog into a room in the white house and taking unspecified liberties therethe president is up for reelection within two weeks and the media is already beginning to home in on the indiscretion his opponent has ads playing maurice chevaliers thank heaven for little girls his handlers know hes in deep trouble and they need to generate a smokescreen to deflect all the attention from the voters isnt this lack of modern news organizations respect for the facts reminiscent of saddam hussein and nuclear weapons or the rather incredible concoction of 19 hijackers flying planes into buildings under direction of a cavedwelling 45yearold cia operative hooked up to a kidney machine for my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews please visit my site thecoffeecoastercombrian wright copyright 2007,black_comedy
yes the dog needs to be wagged severely by the tail if politics is nothing but a branch of show business it is nothing but tall tales and scary stories in this film they fantasize the reelection of a president based on a hollywood secret production of a story that sounds truer than reality the president is going to be accused of some sexual misconduct  read my lips  twelve days before election day so his advisers invent a war in albania which is deflated by the cia who do not like for once what is not true then they go on with the invention of a us prisoner of war left behind and finally freed and brought home a rip van winkle of modern times poor schumann a rapeoffender who is severely psychotic and who tries to rape the first woman he sees through a diners window in the middle of nowhere he ends up killed by the husband of the woman and he is brought back home directly to arlington superb unluckily the producer turns psychotic in his turn and wants the credit for the super production that reelected the president so he dies of a massive heart attack on his way to hollywood picked by some cia agents or is it fbi and does it have any importance at all they could have really done the same thing with the war on iraq it could and would have been a lot more palatable than it is right now the film is greatly done though it has little depth and as a comic taste and bitter after taste of course it is all a story and it has no truth whatsoever does it not dr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine  university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne,black_comedy
very intriguing and fascinating movie its about how the us government tricks the entire nation and stuff like that the president apparently based on bill pimpdaddy clinton is accused of sexual harassment naturally the best thing to do when that happens is declare war on some country no one really cares about or knows how to find in this case the us go to war with albania which is all staged in a studiothe acting performances by robert deniro and dustin hoffman were brilliant and really keep you tuned in the film is made and acted so well that although not a real lot happens you just cant stop watching it interesting,black_comedy
the movie is brilliantly written for an ensemble cast which delivers in spades well worth the rental feeor i dare to saybuy it  robert deniro solid gold anne hechesolid dustin hoffmanincredible william h macysuperb etc etc political sarchasm and satire held together with a brilliant plot so good it almost could be true  in todays society where the media spoon feeds us everything this movies tries to have a fun look at how ridiculous some decisions are made and why top notch production from top to bottom classic music from mark knoffler willie nelson has more than a moment in the movie where he steals the show this movie really made me feel good to see the truth be told but even more that i can laugh at it,black_comedy
perhaps more than anything else this film illustrates how technology and spin can change the worldif only for one day the disheveled robert de niro as connie brean is the king of spin with a supporting cast of a hollywood producer hoffman and in perhaps her best role anne heche as winifred ames2 weeks before the presidential election the president becomes embroiled in a sex scandal and brean is brought on to distract the public for as long as he can with only two weeks to go it seems a daunting taskwar is as american as apple pie and war is show business connie must distract the nation using props and the illusion of war to steer public opinion away from the president and toward his phony war with an array of costars from dennis leary to willie nelson the film moves from a comedy to borderline psychosis and all of it seems reasonable which probably is both hysterical and terrifying,black_comedy
im not sure anymore as time goes by if we actually landed man on the moon films like capricorn one question that viably but are foreseen as entertainments i think a film like might seem quite ludicrous to the average person but whos to say that the right producer and strategist couldnt fake a war and get their president reelected in barry levinsons marvelousworking form a sharp script from david mametpolitical satire the united states president has been caught in a sexual act with a youngish girla firefly girland needs help from someone fast for if this flaw in his humanity lingers in the press and media his slipping in the polls will become catastrophic to his campaign for reelection enter mr fixit robert deniro who has the uncanny ability to get peoplepolitical and governmentalout of messes who with presidential aide anne heche coerces through smooth manipulation hollywood producer extraordiaire dustin hoffman to fake a war with albania to bring americas eyes away from the controversial sexual act by the presidentthe film follows their tasks to do just this as they face lots of unforeseen crisis along the way such as their presidents maneuvers to keep them from completing their mission due to the cia probing their having to develop a war heroplayed by woody harrelson great in his small rollwho is actually a convict their working over certain individuals to get things done and most importantly somehow smoothing out rough edges when it comes to faking a war with a country who has nothing to do with the us and keeping certain untruths secretthe film has a dynamite performance from hoffman as a producer who can work magic with ease when it comes to keeping the spirit of an idea alive often when they are faced with certain ordeals hoffman is able to concoct amazing scenarios out of the blue i thought some of the early developments in creating a war torn albania was hilarious such as finding a certain cat to be held in refugee kirsten dunsts hands and how willie nelson has to come up with that just right albania songthough the funny part was his bewilderment about jim belushis being albanian the way the war hero shumann is created is stunning to see develop and just shows how really terrific this screenplay isseeing the media tackled with a horsecollar through movie magic is really a hoot and i love this movies way of showing people all over the place putting together an elaborate ruse to fool the american people just to reelect a man who was caught with his hands in the girlscout cookie jar,black_comedy
good work for dustin hoffman and denirothey go great together loved woody harrelsongreat movie about producing this thing could be rally happening  so watch out good work for the producers they couldnt have passed out the script its amazing how anne heche fits between those two pillars of all time cinematography the plot is made heavier second by second telling lies is the life of the main characters its superb how well is the presidents face hidden  he doesnt even matter in the hole story just a muppet at others people easegreat movie again,black_comedy

a great performance of dustin hoffman giving us the opportunity to see the right or not fact thats hollywood is a hall other world from other places and its giving the movie a push to magical places of satire thats showing us the power of a producer today to full us together with the white house with rubbish and sheet that you cant even describe the size of the lies in them so maybe its right also in the real world and maybe not and if its not true then we may give some respect for barry levinson and hes writers that gave us this short masterpiece and created this beautiful world that in it a hollywood producer and his crew and a usa president and his crew can fabricate a war and war hero in less than a two weeks and also to make the people believe i think that that movie is so good and really working on us and making us to believe that this phenomenon is a real phenomenon the phenomenon is that hollywood producers has there own world and interests that are very different from our worldbecause of the greatest performance by dustin hoffman since the rain man,black_comedy
a truly satiric movie about what goes on behind the scenes in american politics after a resent sex scandal the president is loosing support a movie producer is set to produce a televisionwar with albania to cover up the scandal and gain the president popularity for the upcoming electioni just loved this movie and i think most people will the story is seems simply wild and farfetched but when you think about it how can you be sure this isnt the reality it shows the power of the media and how you can use that power if you know the tricks of the trade it may make you think twice about what you hear in the future now these are all serious subjects but this movie seems far from serious the well written dialog delivered perfectly by the actors is just hilarious de niro does a great job as conrad brean the most serious character hoffman and willie nelson delivers great and really funny performances as the producer and the songwriter the rest of the cast is nothing less then goodthe score is really nice knopfler gives the right cowboy feel to it and make is all seem so over the top american and the additional song are great clichs that fits like a glovethe cinematography does not have your average movie look to it it looks more like a news footage with some shock zooming and hand held camera yet its just in some situations so its not in any way annoying it just reminds you subconsciously of news feed or something and it makes all this about them influencing people through the media even stronger the cinematography is all in all good there are some really nice shots and as for the rest its niceis a funny movie with a good and satiric story i think everyone can enjoy i even think politicians can see the humor in it,black_comedy
an interesting satire on the media and the ultimate government control of it the film has some things to say about the general publics conviction that news is unbiased truth as well as how far political figures will go to maintain power the film is in the end all a bit too silly and outrageous to work smoothly as a thoughtprovoking satire but some of the concepts along the way are fascinating enough to make the film worth a look the president is shown in a comical manner as a puppet figure with no power to decide anything other than the colour of the kitten and we only ever see him from behind or see others talking to him on the phone showing just how unimportant he is such a notion does however leave the film a bit empty as we have no idea who is ultimately in control of everything and what those in control want this makes it difficult to connect with the emptyheaded motivations of the characters the film tries to compensate for the resulting void with some character study but it does not really succeed because the mediapolitical commentary is much more intriguing than the characters are as the characters are mainly stereotypes it is also a bit too talkative but even if not perfect the film has a lot of good points it is generally well acted well written and full of good ideas it becomes tiresome towards the end with its drawbacks but there is still a lot in it to like and it provides quite a bit to think about,black_comedy
for those that say this is too far fetchedcheck your history about 1 year after this movie came out william jefferson clinton on the eve of his impeachment hearing ordered an attack on iraqseveral writers referenced the moviewith comments about life imitating art the truth was clinton did not have the votes to postpone impeachment and the decision to attack iraq was born on air force 1 as a means of buying some time heres an excerpt from one articleactually using the titletitle president clinton attacks iraq on eve of impeachment voteanother scenario to discourage american about their current system of government subtitle just as the script calls for an embattled president to go to war to save his presidency clinton orders a massive attack on iraq just hours before the house of representatives was scheduled to begin debate on the impeachment the objective is to so discourage americans about our government we will accept a new one this movie is brilliantly written well acted and just plain fun to watch its a 10 trust medoc,black_comedy
i saw this movie in the theater so my memory alludes me does anyone remember why they were throwing pairs of shoes up onto hydro wires i remember that it was to deal with something political duh the movie like about a lost soldier or something regardless in my neighborhood there are shoes thrown up in the air and every time i see them it aggravates me something awfulwow i cant believe i need 10 lines of text to post this obviously first time posting here its quite dictatorial wont let me spell things the canadian way oh well id just really like to find the answer to this question,black_comedy
i loved those scenes where they improvise different people sitting in one room and creating a story and the fact that they are doing it for the reality and not for some movie is the best part about it i mean just imagine that is the reality dustin hoffman and robert deniro built a wonderful team in this movie especially hoffman was just brilliant the way he played that producer who seeks nothing more than recognition for his work was just a joy to watch coming to the story ive hardly ever seen something original like this before and all this just because of clinton i think at last clinton was a fabulous president i mean he did his work in an excellent manner and what he didnt do so excellent was his private life but if i was an american i just wouldnt care but unfortunately so many americans didnt think that way and blasted it into a big scandal well anyway in that way we got this great moviei thank everyone who worked on this movie for this fine cinemaraycasps why is it only rated 7 you should be kidding,black_comedy
this movie is like a divination simple probably you are right but who can advance in 1997 that bush was going to make the same where are the mass destruction weaponsshoeman why attacking irakalbaniaa good movie to start been critic with the politics and the the tones of rubbish we have to eat everydayfrom lots of sentences that are extremely actual now i just like to quote one that summarizes a very depth though tv destroyed the electoral processsincerely do you think is a simple movie,black_comedy
there is really no way to say this but i really liked this movie maybe because i like politics so i was really attracted to this movie yes at times it was a little boring but over all a must watch filmrating 910,black_comedy
extremely creative film in a day of mundane gun fights and terroristfighting films  creating a false cause created a great film im not sure if film would fall into the catagory of drama or comedy but a number of scenes had me falling out of my chair,black_comedy
this movie was very funny it was cool how they pulled off all those events that were not even real  even more surprising was that the rest of the world seemed not to know that there was no war going on much less doing anything about it  the possibility of such things dicussed in this movie are prime examples to show why no one trusts the us government  sad ending all he wanted was credit for his work and why not he was a famous producer who did his best work in covering for this sleazy president and for that they executed him  dont trust the us government is all i can say,black_comedy
isnt a well made film  barry levinson never went beyond his work with rain man and good morning vietnamthats a given  now he is stuck making halffilms that fall apart quicker than they come together the natural was like that and so is except the natural never clicked to start withon the positive side mamet creates an articulate script thats enjoyable to hear and flows from the many actors with such precision  my only complaint with the writing is that once the movie gets going it trips falls and careens into the end  other than that it is a nice satire with more than its share of dumb moments and points of wisdomnotice all the different efforts gone into making the phony war look real this is exactly how reality tv works  create the fake drag in some x variables to silence any plot holes and fill the gaps with loopholes so you can always fall back on them  smart thinking huhoverall i generally respect my 2star ratings more than 3stars i dont know why as a drama wag doesnt work as a comedy wag sputters about  im sure the coen brothers couldve done better  a solid 25 out of 5 stars,black_comedy
how can anyone say this movie is unbelievable  its exaggerated sure but even at that its uncomfortably true to life  see the carefullystaged destruction of saddam husseins statue or the spin on jessica lynch just to name examples from the iraq war alone beyond all that its full of witty bits and witty performances  how can you not like willie nelson saying its hard to rhyme albania and how many movies play both sides of the fence so well  rabid conservatives should enjoy the movies slaps at hollywood rabid liberals should enjoy the movies slaps at winatallcosts politicians this film is funny surprising and well worth seeing,black_comedy
watching tv news footage has become different after this moviethis movie is a mustseeit should make you a little more alert what to believe or better what not would it really be impossible to fake things at such a leveli dont think sogreat acting and a story with so many little kicks to be watched over and over again ,black_comedy
is dark  extremely dark  its also funny at times  dustin hoffman delivers as usual  woody harrelson made me laugh  but please  do not use willie nelson  and let denis leary do his own thing for a while oh and i forgot  some of the camera zooms were irritating  made me want to shut it off teds grade b,black_comedy
looks like someone up there watched the movie and used it as blueprints for many events that took place since 1998  a mustsee for everyone who votes and thinks  best relevant example from the recent events  jessica lynch story check out the bbc version,black_comedy
absolute garbage take a bunch of big names throw in cameos by stiffs like heche and willy nelson do a lot of adlibbing that was only funny to the actors and what do you get another lame satire not even remotely believable it scans like mamets speeddream of what the white house is actually like god he sucks and so does de niro whose name is fast becoming videoese for dont rent this movielooks like it was filmed in about 3 days and the director was too lazy to do any editing just threw the whole mess on the screen and figured the actors names would sell the movie if youre really into watching big stars putting in sloppy performances in what feels like a pet project gone to seed this is the movie for you if you want a show about white house politics that doesnt blow go watch the west wing it makes mamets soggy dialog look like the bad joke that it is the inane ramblings of a pastit playwrightawfulrstj,black_comedy
wow after watching this film i must say that i have become more skeptical of everything they play on television it is also so scary that the secret service can do anything to anyone from now on should i not trust the american government anymoreanyway i have all these thoughts because this film portrays the events so realistically coupled with great acting a very plausible script i do believe they would do anything to win the presidency this film is fantastic,black_comedy
i have a lot of positive feelings about this movie it was positively one of the worst things ive ever seen it was positively inane and insulting to both my intelligence and the intelligence of our nation it was the most far fetched stupid and smug satire ive positively ever seen it was positively diniros worst role ever a good satire must have at least a marginal thread of credibility but at every turn this stupid movie is 8 billion light years from the magical formula of plausible satire with subtle exaggeration its totally conceited and jerky it positively stunk to high heaven not one person in america not even a illiterate rube living in a cabin with no electricity would ever fall for the hoax upon which this entire movie is founded america flagellating itself as entertainment no thank you i am positively astounded that the country loved this film as much as it did and i rented it with positive expectations i was expecting it to be good instead i got positively repulsed to compare clintons attack on iraq on the eve of his impeachment to the ridiculous premise of this movie is convoluted sophistry a dreadful movie a positive groaner from beginning to end and woody harrelsons character was as badly conceived and acted as anything that has ever left the hollywood lots is worse than a waste of time it is positively nauseating,black_comedy
great actors de niro hoffman in a movie that is so realistic that i would be glad if everybody would have seen this film you want to know how american politics works how americans think and how propaganda  just another way of advertising they are brought to think right  just watch this film i would definitely not call the film a comedy its too serious however truth never came up soooooo funny film should be shown in every school  but this will not happen looks like the simple truth is too harmful for some guys,black_comedy
i just recently saw on video and it was definitely not what i expected after reading reviews that were extremely high and hearing people recommend the movie i definitely wanted to check this outdont get me wrong i love comedies and i thought that a political spoof would work beautifully unfortunately it didnt after watching nearly half an hour i thought why isnt this film being funny i clearly dont understand why it was categorized as a comedy it seemed like a bunch of chitterchatter that went too fast for anyone to comprehend itits weird i learned more about the plot from reviews than the actual movie as a totally incomprehensible mess this movie would only appeal to those with incredible brain capacity or to those who want to give themselves a comprehension test the ending too left me scratching my head in disbelief overall this movie is disappointing it didnt come close to being funny and the extremely fast talking clouded up the plot the acting was ok but thats about it should you want to see this film be sure to turn your brain up to full power but who knows you may get bored at any given moment my rating ,black_comedy
i mean so much of this seems to have come true a hollywoodproducer fabricating a war to help cover up a presidential scandaland i dont mean just with clinton does anyone remember thefalkan islands and why we were there it seems every government has done this at least every ten years anyway theperformances are fantastic in this film hoffman and deniro aretops and anne heche is at her best everyone in this film whichapparently was made for very little money does a great job see it,black_comedy
the film evoked a few welldeserved chuckles but it was overall blandly constructed the forceful acting doesnt seem to fit the laid back feel of the film there are some films that its great when i dont know what is going to happen next there was a point in this film when i actually reached that point but i also didnt seem to care what happened next either hoffman is great here though,black_comedy
ugh what a waste of time there is no reason why this movie should have gotten such good reviews if theres any manipulation in the media it was for the reviews of this film if you must watch this movie out of curiosity try not to pay for it,black_comedy
these spin artists seemed so unreal that i began to believe that they couldnt exist apart from fiction maybe that was the subliminal message of this picture if they are really like these characters here in the real world then the politicos can get away with anything,black_comedy
great film with great acting great screenplay and an unbelievable story that seems more believable when reviewing recent history when watching the movies with 911 in mind it is scary how much the public behaviour displayed in the film is copied into real behaviour,black_comedy
this film looked like it should be good the presidential affairstoryline was good the actors are good but in the end they make so little out of it the plot is inconsistent wildly implausible a lot of the time the acting is not up to scratch but then they were fairly hardpressed with the characters they were given to work with and overall it is very disappointing,black_comedy
is all a movie must be and itso unbelievably good you just cant believe its that good its us of a at its best de niro  hoffman are terrific but willie nelson is just absolutely fabulous can you imagine they tried to dub this movie in russia luckily they failed and it was subtitled what a break for willie nelson fans,black_comedy
this was the best political satire i have ever seen  the plot was outrageous and yet so much of it was familiar and rang true  the actors seemed to have great fun with it  a movie for political junkies and cynics,black_comedy
this movie scared me it made me realize how vulnerable we are to press and hollywood  deniro was more evil than the hoffman character who viewed it as a movie deniro knew it was life and death though the movie did drag what it lacked in action it made up for in satire and black comedy woody harrelson was particulary good as the war hero next time i watch the news ill think of this movie,black_comedy
i have to concur with the many here who were disappointed there were a few good scenes here and there but they were way too few and far between  maybe the whole premise kept some other people going and maybe its like some people said where it is not laugh out loud funny but it washardly even for me whimsically funny  the other thing is in any movie you have to either a care about at least 1 character or b really hate a character  i didnt have either in this film  i didnt care about the three major players deniro hoffman hache any joy from the film came from the side characters willie nelson  woody harrelson but even they were not very inspiring it was kind of like a documentary almost except that it was fiction so it lost that are of it as well i was really trying to enjoy it but it just didnt work for mefor my money primary colors was the much better political film of 1998,black_comedy

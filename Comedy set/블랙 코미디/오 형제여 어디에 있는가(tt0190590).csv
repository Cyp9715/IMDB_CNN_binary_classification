we lived through the depression and related to some of the conditions portrayed we have watched it perhaps a dozen times each time we see it we pick up on something we had missed because we were still laughing at or discussing an earlier scene or line the entire film was a collection of photographically great faces we are still asking ourselves whether the entire cast were professionals or whether some were individuals found on location the film was rich with subtle tieins like the children tied together with twine as the prisoners were connected by chains we still think the cow may have been hit unintentionally fords of that era had mechanical brakes the driver of the car may not have been accustomed the longer stopping distances required the many allusions to ulysses odyssey inspired us to do an internet search we found a modern text version and discovered more sly references we appreciate blue grass and country music as originally american and found it thoroughly enjoyable along with the authentic go to sleep little baby and down from the mountain we were emotionally touched by this film because of our age and find it totally entertaining every time we view it we are still amazed that someone not of our generation could have captured the essence of that period of united states history,black_comedy
thank goodness for the coen brothers their success has brought them bigger budgetsbut hasnt rid them of their creativity i had planned on seeing another movie but it was sold out so i went to this one instead by the time it began i had forgotten what movie i was there to see i was surprised in more ways than one this movie is hilarious but they dont make any cheap jokes just to get the laughs the writing is brilliant and delivered with great skill by george clooney after this nobody can say hes just a pretty face and the rest of the cast it can be appreciated on many levels whether you remember the odyssey or not i cant remember the last time i saw a movie that was this clever ive seen others i would describe as beautiful intriguing funny and charming all of which also describe oh brother but this movie reminded me of older seinfeld episodes where all the subplots came together in the end you can feel that their journey is building up to something but you cant tell what and the coen brothers do not fail us the end is certainly not disappointing its surprising and ties up all the loose ends neatly without wearing the story out,black_comedy
the coen brothers have truly outdone themselves in this wonderful saga of three escaped convicts though it is based on the odyssey the ancient work of homer you do not have to have read the odyssey to be able to follow the story the brothers coen have woven a tapestry of celluloid and aural delights the soundtrack is intrinsic to the film indeed it is as though the soundtrack is the product and the film is wrapping paper each character is wonderfully exploited and harkens back to the days of old when films were rich with character actors whose very appearance in the film adds richness texture and authenticity george clooney is magnificent as the grease haired everett ulysses mcgill a honest con on the run whose pompous linguistics and vocabulary are comical and endearing easily the best coen film to date as well as clooneys best effort clooney is good enough to warrant a best actor nomination as is tim blake nelsons portrayal of the dimwitted friend delmar while the film itself is deserving of a best film nod,black_comedy
having seen most of the coen brothers previous films i expected something different and slighty off centre obwat is certainly those things but it also has a heart as big aswellas big as mississippi it is one of the most plainly enjoyable movies to have come out in recent times intelligent wellcrafted clever and superbly actedcharacters are delivered in their myriad shades by a group of marvellous actors george clooney winning me over completely with his clark gableish looks and character having only ever seen him in three kings and his thin red line cameo i am now a fan more comedy please georgejohn tuturro and tim blake nelson ably assist especially nelson if ever the simpsons is made into a movie then he must be a natural to play cletus the slackjawed yokel i dont think there is a performance that falls short of excellent from the entire cast my special favorite is stephen root as the blind radio station mangreat oldtimey music a jiggy type dance by clooney that i am trying to learn and a feel of depression era southern us enhanced by sepialike photography make this the best movie ive see  so far this century the only drawback to the film is that it has almost sent me broke buying the soundtrack the dvd and a dvd player to play it onits that good,black_comedy
not being a fan of the coen brothers or george clooney anyone can see the skepticism i took into the theater once again someone in hollywood dares to create something different this time it was those zanie for a temporary lack of a better word coens doing their thing to one of the great works in literary history who wouldve ever thought homer had this in mind i dont know where this film is going to fit in the history books of hollywood but it will be in both mine and many others dvd or vhs library it is one of those films that you can watch over and over the story is brilliantly written clean and entertaining with a couple of gumpesque brushes with fame great performances by clooney turturro nelson and a brief but hilarious holly hunter being born in mississippi and raised in other parts of the south i wish more people would poke a little fun at us like this they even invoke a soundtrack fitting for the rural south you are not doing anything better this weekend go see this movie,black_comedy
this was the best film i saw in the year 2000 the cohen brothers have never let me down before and they certainly didnt this time eitherits one of those rare movies these days  its witty intelligent and vastly entertaining i left the cinema with a warmth in my heart of course theres lot of cohen stuff in there  odd characters and peculiar gadgets welldeveloped plot and magic camerawork but no cohen film is resembling any other cohen film if you overlook the general quality of them of coursethe big surprise for me was that clooney is so good but the true master performance in this movie comes from tim blakenelson but the rest of the cast is superb tooa film that is lightweight comedy with a musical touch that evolve its story round rednecks and old time country music  dripping with wit and intelligence thats a very unlikely combination but its exactly what this picture is,black_comedy
i have walked out of a coen movie before and not quite known how to feel the two best examples of that are the big lebowski and fargo lebowski was so ridiculously original and so filled with strange humour that i had to like it on the other hand there were some unnecessary reveries with flying people and killer bowling balls that just didnt seem to fit the mold of the film still i liked the film and now own a copy of it fargo made me howl with hysterics sometimes i wasnt sure why i was laughing so hard that it made me cry but nonetheless i was there were many seemingly strange characters in fargo but upon further investigation they were really just real people talking about real situations that is why the man with the shovel  or was it a broom  was so sidesplittingly funny when he was telling the police officer about some funny looking man down at the bar the other night and that is also why the theater erupted in laughter when he then says that there are some funny looking clouds coming in i own a copy of this film too the coens have a way of masking their film and their characters as being somewhat eccentric and perhaps a little off the wall but if you look closer at some of those same characters that seem zany you will always find that in some strange way they all ring true that is what is quite exceptional about o brother where art thou this is a film that is out there i mean it is not even in the same ballpark as a traditional film i reviewed the film shaft this past summer and in it i said that shaft was an okay film that i have seen a thousand times before but you can not say that about a coen brothers film and you most certainly can not say that about this onethis film has everything in it from a jail break crooked southern politicians muses references to what i can only assume are historical figures riverside baptisms bank robberies violence towards animals singing flocks of religious fanatics kkk lynch mobs and so on there are obviously many references to homers odyssey in here as well but i wouldnt know that because i have never read homers odyssey or even knew one thing about it every other newspaper reviewer seems to know all about it and they think that this cynicism and almost spooflike quality towards it makes the film that much better well coming from a guy who doesnt know anything about it i can tell you that it is still an entertaining film there were times when again as is usual for a coen film i wasnt sure why i was entertained or laughing but i wasthis is a road picture where three men travel along the way to find a hidden treasure that clooney says he has hidden to his two other cell mates he has to take them along because they were also chained to him when they had their chance to escapei like all the principal actors in the film and many of them are coen cronies it was nice to see goodman again it was nice to see hunter and especially turturro who seems to have a place in every coen film its too bad they didnt find a place for steve buscemi but that is a different story all together but back to clooney the man just has charisma he is a one hell of an actor as well and here he is not quite as zany as the others but even he has his own idiosyncrasies his work here is quite awesome and i really hope this shows that he is capable of playing any range of characternow after heaping all this praise on the film let me just say this as well i didnt really enjoy the film at first i found it to be quite tedious and a little boring there were too many ideas in here and not enough care went into harnessing them for all what they were worth but then the film began to grow on me it took a while but it did grow on me i dont think this is their best film but it is still a good one and i am giving it a 85 but the reason that i do recommend this film is for one reason onlyevery day you can go look into the paper and look at the films that are playing and say to yourself seen it seen it oh seen it last year that is the same as this film and that is the same as that film most films have been recycled in some form or another not the coens films they have not been recycled and if they have i dont know about it that is reason enough to see something that they put out originality counts for a lot in my books the coens are original and they are good and that is not common in todays cinema enjoy them while they are allowed to make films because you dont get vision like this in many films so when you do enjoy it,black_comedy
the coen brothers have done it again three depression era convictsgeorge clooney john turturro and tim blake nelsonescape a mississippi chain gang and head off in search of buried treasure that will fund their new lives along the way they sing on the radio and become much sought after stars as well as escapees great laughs and a soundtrack that is a lessonintroduction to bluegrass musicclooney is outstanding as the fast talking quick witted ulysses everett mcgill holly hunter plays his estranged wife turturro and nelson are flawless stumblebums also in the cast are john goodman and charles durningdan tyminksi provides the singing voice for george clooney on i am a man of constant sorrow the soggy bottom boys song that serves as a template for the bluegrass laden soundtrack that also features alison krauss ralph stanley the whites john hartford the cox family and gillian welch toe tapping knee slapping fun for the whole family youll be surprised with how relaxed and funny this movie is,black_comedy
i was into the movie right away  ive seen the other coen movies with the exception of raising arizona and ive noticed that each of their movies has a color  fargo is graywhite lebowski is bright orange and this movie is a pleasant yellowthe bright pleasant qualities of this movie start right away  soon the look is accompanied by the great great music  its the old folk sound the kind of music that was written during a time when music was enjoyed as a part of day to day life  enjoyed by everyone chaingangs church choirs and even prison escapeesnow about the prison escapees  i dont know what crime their characters could have possibly committed as they are a very very friendly group of guys  clooney is fantastic completely nailing his rolego see this as soon as possible  i believe that it can be enjoyed by anyone at some level  for some reason the theater i was in was full of old ladies and old men and they loved ityoull love it too i promise  i was compelled to get my hands on the soundtrack right away,black_comedy
one of the finest pieces of story telling ever to hit celluloid  the performances are so perfect and deadon and the nuances so subtle that this movie defies description  it is no wonder that the reviews you read run the gamut from piece of junk to superb to just plain confused this is a mustsee movie and from there youre on your own you have to decide for yourself  note however that this film follows its own course  loosely based on ulysses and with its own symbolism characters and themes  to spot them all you will need to watch carefully think constantly and in all likelihood see the film many times more than once not to worry it improves with each viewing,black_comedy
my husband received dvd of obwat for christmas and it was the best gift we received we watch it every time we need to laugh and so far we have viewed it 12 timesthe scenery in this movie is beautiful and the music is outstandingwe also purchased the soundtrack and we play it in our vehicles and at home when ever we need a pick me up and that too is dailyif anyone needs a suggestion for a good gift for movie lovers this movie is itthe characters are hilarious  charming  and their facial expressions are too funny to describei have always been a fan of george clooney but now i am also a fan of tim blake nelsondelmar  and john turturro peteand am now looking for them in other movies you gotta see this movie,black_comedy
in the deep south during the 1930s  ulysses george clooney leads a chain escapee along with fellow escapees john turturro  tim blake nelson  all of them find themselves caught up in extraordinary situations  the three escaped convicts search for hidden treasure while merciless lawmen daniel von bargen  royce d applegate pursues them  along the way the trio meets curious characters as the historical baby face nelson michael badalucco who was a homicidal gangster named lester m gillis he was known for his hot temper and itchy trigger finger  and governor pappy odaniel charles druning who is based on w lee pappy odaniel who served as governor of texas not mississippi from 193941 and later as us senator  as the main starring getaways bound for home  where waits his wife penny or penlope holly hunter  sometimes you have to lose your way to get back home an enjoyable film by cohen brothers that packs thrills  dry humor  action  wonderful songs and numerous references to homers odyssey  o brother where art thou comes from the title of the moviewithinamovie in preston sturges sullivans travels 1941  starred by three rare characters suffering several coanesque adventures  what the trio encounter along the way are a number of surprising situations and weird roles that  when all is said and done  seem like just that individual incidents that never really add up to a whole plot  3 protagonists fit well enough to comprise a pretty agreeable yarn  though relies heavily on their peculiar and continuous relationship  the film includes characters or places with the stereotypes of the regions they take place in  as the southern accents and dustbowl landscape from mississippi  the whole concept is loosely based on author howard waldrops novella a dozen tough jobs which recounts the labors of hercules in a similar mississippi setting  albeit ten years earlier  another possible link comes from the william faulkner short novel old man  sympathetic acting by main stars accompanied by a magnificent plethora of secondaries as charles durning  thomas king  ray mckinnon  lee weaver  ed gale  stephen root  musetta vander  as well as coen regulars as john goodman and special mention for john turturro  the picture had big success  being nominated for 2 oscars and another 7 wins  35 nominations and won five grammys  highly keen soundtrack by t bone burnett  in which mundane sounds are made to seem eerie or used for absurd effect  george clooney practiced his singing for weeks but in the end his singing voice was dubbed by country blues singer dan tyminski  the films soundtrack became an unlikely blockbuster even surpassing the success of the film  by early 2001 it had sold five million copies  spawned a documentary film three followup albums  colorful as well as evocative cinematography by roger deakins  coens usual  the whole film was graded digitally on computer  the negative was scanned and then colors were digitally finetuned the motion picture was well written and directed by joel and ethan coen  they have shared these duties on all of their films but joel has always been listed as director and ethan as producer  the first coen brothers film where both he and brother ethan coen are given directing and producing credits was ladykillers 2004 both of whom are part of the prestigious group of individuals to have won oscars for writing  directing and producing in the same year for the film no country for old men 2007 their career is splendid from first film  blood simple 1984 to arizona baby 1987 millers crossing 1990  barton fink 1991 the great lebowski 1998 the man who wasnt there 2001  intolerable cruelty 2003  burn after reading 2008  a serious man 2009  true grit 2010 among others ,black_comedy
the coen brothers may just be cinemas greatest crackpot auteursthey deliver sly ironic stories that generally consist of several weird and wild subplots that all collide in an ending that always leaves a few loose ends for the audience to ponder bless them in the midst of the blockbusters franchises and hipster road movies seeing a coen brothers movie is like inhaling a breath of fresh air this one is no exception an adaptation of homers sprawling greek tragedy the odyssey retold in a new settingdustbowlera mississippi george clooney stars as ulysses everett mcgill a slick suave greaseball of a man who was arrested for practicing law without a license when he hears that his wifeholly hunteris getting remarried to another man the hysterical ray mckinnon ulysses busts loose from a chain gang to set things right however he must drag along the two men who are chained to him violent confused peter john turturro and ditsy dim delmar tim blake nelson is witty without being onedimensional along the way the coen brothers find time to pack in a runin with reallife criminal babyface nelson a group of bewitching shedevils a huge flood and a kkk rally attended by a hopeful politician and a malicious oneeyed bible salesman john goodman plays him with what could only be described as beastly allure through it all the film photographed ravishingly by roger deakins is set to a glorious soundtrack of roots music john hart chris thomas king and allison krauss all deliver excellent tracks but the real highlight is when clooney and his cohorts burst into a toetapping version of man of constant sorrow not for the sake of the plot but for pure enchantment and thats what brother is all aboutnot story although it has a great one but serving up a great slice of unadulterated folksy bliss,black_comedy
coen movies are easy to spot they have that feel the feel of originality and oddity the crazy story lines and characters oh brother has all that the toned down dustiness of the movie feels less like a gimmick and more like its supposed to be there adding to the already thick southern filter the movies viewed throughthe storyline is imaginative and totally impossible to predict giving credit to homer is a bit silly since the references to the oddessy are made for fun and could easily have been discarded without changing the storycharacters are the usual bunch of misfits and crazies you expect george clooney does the role of his lifetime remember the usual smug to a varying degree annoying clooney you see in every movie hes in forget him this is another person his two companions are good support and fodder for his clever remarks and halfbaked planssince this is set in the 30s south there are tons of things to use as comedic elements kkk crooked politicians religion rednecks amplify that with coens scriptwriting talent and you will laugh a lot there is even one of the trademark hallucination scenes kind ofwhat more can you say than thank you coens i wont tell you to enjoy this movie its very simple just watch it,black_comedy
another outstanding movie by the coen bros while their style remains similar there appeal can be hit and miss this movie is right on target this is a rare film that combines excellent casting superb cinematography and well acted roles and the best part about this movie is how much more your liking and respect for it grows the more you watch never before have i found myself so engrossed in a dialogue driven movie every viewing brings new laughs and exposes new subtleties that i was sure i caught george clooney firmly establishes himself capable of acting in a comedic role fans of dennis miller will certain appreciate the intelligent humor this movie provides and coen brother fans should have a new personal favorite and a small suggestion from this end if you didnt find it funny the first time turn on the captions and grab a dictionary youll be rolling by the time the boys are in a tight spot,black_comedy
about the discussion on the south the rednecks and the hillbillies well i am from the south argentina near the south pole to be exact is this southern enough seriously some stories are universal we have never been to greece nor lived the classic period of homer but he speaks to us today so does shakespeare and dante and stories from far unknown places also reach us when told with sensibility intelligence humor just like o brother besides we all the rest of the world have our own hillbillies too and our own depression era ever heard of argentina during year 2001 our politicians and racism our gentle souls just like delmar and tommy i simply loved this movie folks despite the subtitles despite being on the other side of the world and please forgive my errors in english i tried my bestps i believe nobody quoted this favorite phrase when delmar asks george nelson what does he do for a living while handling him the machine gun,black_comedy
first for those of you who dont know who owen gleiberman is hes one of entertainment weeklys movie critics from what i remember reading in his review when o brother where art thou came out he said it was just stupid stereotypes and gave it an f now that ive actually seen this movie i got it for my birthday a few months ago i realize how stupid i was to trust the opinions of a man who also had the nerve to give x men a can excellent film in all senses im normally not a george clooney fan until then the only movie with him i liked was from dusk till dawn but his performance in this film was perfect and he truly deserved that golden globe he won for it i also really liked the actor who played delmar his realistically amusing facial expressions and hilarious lines we thoughtyou wasa toadkept me happy all throughout the film the frightening sheriff  made an effective villain and the equally intense scene with the kkk rally was really exciting to behold the references to the odyssey were charming and well done although i still dont get who george nelson was supposed to resemble in the ancient greek story however the siren scene and its aftermath were quite funny and john goodman is creditable as the one eyed big dan teague easily one of the best scenes in the movie is when the soggy bottom boys sing man of constant sorrow that song quickly brought a smile to my face and should have won that mtv movie award for best musical performance so you can forget about what the professional critics at entertainment weekly said about it and just enjoy this hysterical light hearted and worthwhile film,black_comedy
the coen brothers have done very well and accomplished a movie that completely shocked me slight spoiler alert the movie is based on the odyssey and because it follows it so much i would highly recommend rereading it or at least look at the cliffs notes the thing is if you know the odyssey you will get a lot of the jokes that are thrown in there  i saw one comment on here by another user who didnt like the movie and thought that the scene spoiler spoiler where the guy slaughters several cows was excessive and that the coen brothers were just trying to be shocking  i was laughing a lot because i understood the connection in the scene to the book  major major spoiler  connection is that in the odyssey they kill very sacred cows of apollo and those men are struck with lightning  in the movie the character who kills the cows is electrocuted in the chair absolutely brilliant  there are tons of odyssey jokes here so much so that if you dont read it before watching at least read it afterwards  you simply cant do the movie total justice without seeing how genius the coens areoh and you will be singing to yourself the type of music you thought you hated before this moviehighly recommended  this is up there on my favorites list a list that is hard to make well not that hard but theres only about 10 titles on itthose who dont see this movie are men in constant sorrow razor,black_comedy
headline says it all really i was a bit sceptical about going to see the film firstly the location was an arty cinema house and that sort of gave me the impression of an artyfarty concept film not made for the pleasure of the mass public and a film to establish clooney as more than a hearthrob however i read the review of the film and according to the review the film would need to be watched more than once to be able to appreciate all the humour as it came thick and fast i think that comment was meant for the dutch originating from the uk i had no trouble with following the filmto my delight i was delighted with the film clooney played his part excellently as did the rest of the cast the humour was great at times very stereotypical at times very subtle even though i had heard of the film it was not a huge box office success to my knowledge which i think it deserved to be watch it and be surprised,black_comedy
a beautiful movie with vivid endearing characters the storyline is broken neatly into episodes apparently much like its source material i havent read homer so other than a few obvious nods to the classic author the cyclops for instance i missed many of the parallels im told are there its difficult to pinpoint what makes this such a magnificent movieprobably because there are so many details that add up the first thing that sold me like so many others was the music the album sales alone stand as a testament to the quality of the soundtrack i realize album sales dont always equal good music but here they do it feels like the movie was made during the great depression if you watch movies made during the time they were all feel good flics several reviewers here have drawn the savy comparison between obwat and it happened one night and specifically between clooneys and gables performances there are so many things that make this movie worth seeing my only complaint that sticks is that it could so easily have been made pg as it stands it is one of the most harmless pg13 films in a long time and i wish the filmmakers hadnt opted to put in the extra dammits to elevate the movie into the more profitable bracket even the famous siren scene seemed tasteful and sweetly seductive rather than racy my point this movie has the potential to make you smile,black_comedy
based on homers odyssey we follow everett ulysses mcgill and his companions delmar and pete as they escape from a chain gang so that mcgill can get home to his family  along the way they must deal with sirens a bible selling cyclops babyface nelson a campaigning governor a klan lynching party and a blind prophetthis is another of the cohen brothers different projects  basically meaning that nothing will make a great deal of sense and wont always follow logical paths but will be full of imagination and energy  the story wont always be gripping unless you know ulysses original adventure  if you do then the story will be a joy as you recognise the parallels between the two tales  even if you dont there is plenty to enjoy here the story is so full of funny imaginative and original characters that you cant help but be drawn in  from badaluccos babyface nelson oh george not the livestock to durnings pappy everything is handled with such an edge of surrealism that its captivatingclooney has never been better and is truly excellent here with his eccentric hick character with a taste for hair cream  turturro is also excellent but nelsons childlike delmar is the best character and a great performance hunter is as good as she usually is in coen stuff and the support cast of durning goodman badalucco etc are all great  the music is fantastic even if you not a fan of this type of music it still fits so totally with the mood of the film that it all works well togetherthis is a wonderful film  yet another from the coens  it has its slow moments and the episodic nature of the story can sometimes give it an aimless feel but overall this is significantly better than the sum of its many great parts,black_comedy
i realize this movie came out 18 years ago but i wasnt on imdb then did imdb even exist i dont know but as im sitting in the barbershop right now this movie is being played on the tv right now and im reminded how much i love this movie in my opinion one of the best comedies ever made i know its not for everyone i have friends who hate it but its a classic to myself and some others i know excellent writing and acting,black_comedy
there is a line in o brother where art thou that sums up not just the consensus view of this movie but also that of nearly every coen brothers production george clooney says to his chained counterpart john turturro its a fool that looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart indeed there may never have been a better and more meaningful statement uttered for that sums up the total outlook joel and ethan have given to us ever since their stunning debut in 1984 with blood simplealthough this is not a new concept for them i think these themes work really well with the setting of this movie one of the most original in remembrance here we get the story of homers the odyssey set in the 1930s of the american south as three bumbling excons search for a treasure while encountering many obstacles along the way however like many a coen brothers movie the plot is just a spot to hang up the arc of the story in order to give way for the really interesting aspects here being the idiosyncrasies of the characters the gorgeous widescreen photography and the overall crass view of human existencethrough all this there is a great amount of fun and joy in this story clooney is the fasttalking slick leader of this weirdly likable trio and despite many believing he is too good looking and polished for the role i believe that only adds to his repertoire for this everett needs to be a fasttalker in order to be taken serious because of his looks turturro and tim blake nelson add comic support but also depth with their portrayals of pete and delmar chained to everett and loyal followers the whole way even with the clever writing and shifty characters there is something of a heart behind this story as well as the typical cynicism of the coensthis is certainly the type of movie that grows on you and multiple viewings are needed not necessarily to understand the plot but to capture the tone and message of the movie if there is one still if nothing else one can certainly appreciate the intelligentstupid mixture of humor the coens are capable of mixing together so well clooney turturro and nelson are wonderful in their respectable roles and of course roger deakins perfectly captures the feeling of the old south with his colorful and rich cinematography here is a great looking fast talking clever movie with not much of a message with the coens in charge what is the problem,black_comedy
another coen classic once again with it being a coen film u have the regulars such as john turturro and john goodman the lead is brilliantly acted by george clooney john turturro is equally great and john goodman is really fantastic in this even though he only has a small partwhat i especially loved about this is the journey of it and what these three fugitives on the run bump into on there travels its a fairly slow laid back film but that doesnt really make the film badnot the best coen film but it beats some of there other titles like millers crossing and the man who wasnt there 810jd seaton,black_comedy
ah coen brothers  you can expect a step up from the humdrum with these two and this movie is no exception its about three escaped convicts off to get some hidden treasure in the deep south of the 40s and based loosely around the greek epic the odyssey with george clooney playing ulysses everett mcgill they have a series of adventures of course including creating a hit musical single that theyre unaware of and meeting a variety of colourful characters like john goodman in the delightful role of big dan teagueis this movie hilarious not to me no its more in the wes anderson vein of being bizarrely quirky some of the jokes are quite dumb and others come from the characters themselves  both in their actions and the reactions of others ulysses constant chatter is a very amusing counterpoint to his companions near inability to speak word indeed the characters here are unlike many comedies fairly well built and become quite likable rising above the general shallowness of the genre the actual plot starts off with them going through a series of seemingly unconnected adventures but concludes somewhat obviously with them all coming to a head nevertheless you cant help but recognise the strangeness and humour in the coordinated dancing of a ku klux klan crowd its just very very bizarreacting is all solid here and clooney once again proves hes not just a pretty face although hes proved himself to me already by now his side kicks  john turturro and tim blake  are all fine too playing congenital idiots and theyre all backed up by a fine supporting cast including goodman in one of his finest ever rolesthe cinematography is as i would expect from the coen brothers excellent theres a lovely feeling of the deep south of the times captured in long shots throughout the movie and an excellent attention to set and costume design the music the most famous component of the movie suits the flavour of the movie though the genre not being in anyway my favourite grated on occasion although the main song of the movie almost made up for it in a toetapping way but once again the coen brothers have pulled off a polished little package ive never seen a bad movie by them thats humorous without being hilarious quirky without being down right weird well acted without being outstanding and generally entertaining without being a best movie ever type well worth a look if you fancy a change 7210,black_comedy
after two years of world war ii movies and roman spectacles i found myself at the local video stores new release section recalling yogi berras quip its dj vu all over againfortunately joel and ethan coen werent  suffering entirely from dj vu when the musical epic oh brother where art thou sprang from their headsat first glance i thought i was watching an intellectualized three stoogers slapstick at least until the three heroes meet john goodman and in an instant i found myself wishing i was paying more attention to this sofarout parody of homers eternally classic epic the odyssey and long before the end of this classictobe had ended i was already planning to watch it again and scrambling and digging for my english translation of ancient greek literaturethe cast and performances and humor have depth and the music will hook your ears as if it came from sirens of bluegrassby folding in eternally beautiful bluegrass slightly tempering the entire mix with the premise of the epic ancient greek poem whipping the entire mix with the absolutely great performances by george clooney john turturro and tim nelson the coen brothers have served up an epic of cinematic homeric proportions that actually may be enjoyed more than onceif you are becoming tired of seeing one time wonders see this for the first second or third time or just get it again for the music,black_comedy
this wasnt the best film i ever saw but there were components to it that i enjoyed completely  the soundtrack is most excellent especially for those of us who are lovers of traditional and bluegrass music  george clooney was the funniestmany of the scenes cracked me up  it was a compelling light hearted rendition of the odesseymuch fun was had by all,black_comedy
spoilers hereinthis movie starts out as a wonderfully cartoonish big brawling slowpoke of a film  with his hillbilly mannerisms walleyed expressions and perfect delivery george clooney gains redemption from the dreadful batman and robin and solaris  im the paterfamilias he proclaims when he sees his daughters  pricelessthis films defenders are those who find genius in things that are merely different  for example watching john turturro yodel is startling but then so is watching a homeless man urinate in a bottle genius lies in context not in eclecticism  after listening to the wonderfully original music that permeates the score the viewer is then treated to an audience singalong of you are my sunshine a song even more loathsome than disco duckthe subplot about dueling politicans made no sense and contributed nothing to the storyline other than as a convenient way to wrap up the ending is there any politician in the world who would storm into a crowded music hall and proclaim i am a member of a secret society  it was a very weak and very lame way of disposing of the subplot villain  why would a man who was so careful and crafty with his campaign throw it all away by raising the ire of a roomfull of people  so stupid and made no sense  this is very sloppy writing by the coensjohn goodman is not a very good actor  although he was brilliant as dan connor on roseanne he just doesnt have the range to play different characters  he delivers his lines as dan connor would little wonder then that the character is named big dan  fred flintstone babe ruth king ralph  he plays the same character time after time just like morgan freeman does  however he has a good screen presence so its understandable that hes a coen brothers staple  holly hunter normally a firecracker is icecold and its difficult to understand what everett sees in her  john turturro is as always on the edge of mania ready to fall off the deep end at any moment  his howl of lust when he sees the women at the river is one of the funniest things hes ever done  looks like petes got the itch delmar deadpans in his philosophical waymy main problem with this movie is that there is no point to any of it there is no goal and no storyline  you cant identify with any of the characters and its difficult to accept everetts longing to be back with his frigid wife  villians pop up right and left but they are just temporary  this film is like a series of halffinished thoughts or halfremembered dreams all leading up to a whole bunch of nothing  the ending fizzles out like a dying candle with everett begging penny to take him back  hmm were back where we startedwith better writing this could have been a great film,black_comedy
i guess everyones entitled to their own opinions about a movie be they good or bad but i just couldnt believe how many of the reviewers on this page wrote in such glowing terms about this turkey and i cant help but feel that theres an element of the emperors new clothes syndrome creeping in somewhere no doubt the aforementioned hacks will all scream philistine if and when they bother to read this particular review but i for one found this film dull and tedious in the extreme i found myself waiting for something momentous to happen but nothing really did the whole thing just plodded along at snails pace  uninspiring plot lines leading toward an equally uninspiring ending by far the worst movie that george clooney has ever been involved in his character was obviously intended to be the brains of the trio alongside those two other dimwits but the whole sorry bunch were just annoying and tiresome gc included and that accent  oh dear me i usually enjoy movies set in the depression era and i sat down in eager anticipation to watch this one the 30s backdrop and the atmosphere conjured up by the bluegrass soundtrack were perhaps the films only saving graces but the plot such as it was and the characters were just awful i watched this movie with my wife and an american friend from the deep south and they too were bored out of their minds by it not worthy of all the hype no way,black_comedy
earnest effort which achieves some success to adapt the classic odyssey story to a 30s nostalgia period piece the adventurers this time are escaped convicts wandering about the depression afflicted south bungling their way into troublethe greatest strength of the film is the wonderful music soundtrack effectively evoking not only the era that this is set in but the spiritual references that run rampant in the film besides its value to the tone of the movie the music is just plain fun to listen towhat cripples the film is that the characters really arent that likable in a comedy you need that element in order to have fun along with them in their misadventures instead we have a bunch of selfish arrogant soulless mean spirited nobodies who really have no positive points at all theyre not imposing enough to make you hate them either so its hard to relate to them at all theyre offered up as clowns but like people who put clown makeup on and march in parades they just arent funnylike the story that inspired it the movie takes these guys on an odyssey encountering a variety of symbolic some even mystical characters everybody is stamped with offensive stereotypes the operative word being stupid people are mocked right and left and consequently no one is left being particularly interesting or appealing the movie doesnt like its own characters and it doesnt let you like them eitherriverside baptisms beautiful sirens stolen cars fistfights radio preachers people being whipped with sticks all are thrown at you in disjointed fashion some evoke a few laughs others confuse or bore you i did laugh when a nerdy guy beat the snot out of an especially obnoxious lead character but there were a lot more pointlessly gratuitous scenes an example some 30s dillingertype guy strafes cows with a tommygun comedy symbolism no just mindless violence which detracts from the intellectual nature of the original source material this story draws uponother adaptations of the odyssey are much better unless youre a george clooney fan rent something else but buy the soundtrack cd the music is great,black_comedy
terrific production and a good comedic performance by george clooney cant save curiously detached occasionally clumsy quasicomedy from joel and ethan coen depressionera road tale hearkens back to yesterday with three escaped chaingang prisoners seeking a hidden fortune and inadvertently becoming country music stars in the process the film meanders along but never builds any momentum it does get a big boost from clooneys charismatic gableesque mugging and also from the art direction and tbone burnetts lively music otherwise the screenplay by the coens is seriously lacking in humor and interest supporting cameos by john goodman and holly hunter fail to add any lift and the secondhalf of the movie slides precariously into selfindulgence  from ,black_comedy
this may be the only film that is blatantly antichristian that i still give a high rating simply because it was so entertaining hopefully some of the religious digs were tongueincheek and not meant in a meanspirited way but im not sure especially considering who made iti do know this was fun to watch and hear except for the excessive usage of the lords name in vain with george clooney as the main culprit the music in here is super led by the catchy man of constant sorrow performed by gary tyminski i also loved soggy mountain boys humorously sang and presented by the three main characters clooney john turturro and tim blake nelson those three guys were hilarious particularly nelson with his rubberfaced looks audibly the entire soundtrack is outstanding under the direction of tbone burnett i wound up buying the cd as millions of other people did fantastic musicthe way this was filmed makes it visually fascinating with scenery enhanced by computer graphics and alltime great roger deakins in charge of the photography all the people in this movie are wacky as are the people who made it the unfortunately cleverbutbiased coen brothers the parade of wild characters wild scenes one after the other and the three likable leads yeah even the profane clooney make this an extremely fastmoving 103minute movie,black_comedy
the movie seems to contain more references to more things than just about any movie i have ever seen or heard aboutthe many references to homers the odyssey are wellknown and mentioned in many places on this fabulous site thank you imdbbut the references to the south come in a close second to homers epic though they arent noted as often id like to help change that and invite others to add their commentsthe movie takes place in mississippithe character charles durning plays  pappy odaniel  was the actual governor of texas 19381942 was in fact a flour baron and toured with a band thats still playing together albeit with new members as well as some of the original ones called the lightcrust doughboys who specialized in texas swing and other oldtyme musicone song that shows up twice  at critical junctures in the movie  is you are my sunshine the official state song of louisiana that was penned by a real louisiana governor jimmie davis who lived to be 101 years old and lived in three different centuries  as durnings character walks into the radio station in the movie one of his assistants mentions     every parish and precinct    involved in his election campaign for governorthe only state where there are parishes and precincts is louisiana  all of the other 49 states have counties and precincts as their political subdivisionsthe flooding of the valley recalls the tva in tennesseethere must be more references that others know about concerning their state or area i for one would like to read about those too so please submit them ,black_comedy

it is simply the best movie i have ever seen the entire cast is superb excellent acting not only george clooney is fabulous as everett but so are the supporting actors tim blake nelson john turturro john goodman michael badalucco holly hunter wayne duvall ray mckinnon etc the cinematography is brilliantly composed magnificent pictures by roger deakins the soundtrack is excellently chosen no wonder it became a tremendous success the story of odyssey by homer is paraphrased with care it captivates you from the beginning to the end the coen brothers did a remarkable job perhaps their bestall in all it is a movie you have to see before you die,black_comedy
its possible to make a smart movie about yokels its much more common to make a movie about yokels that traffics in stupid yokel humor sadly this is the latter the coen brothers have a very sophisticated understanding of american regionalism which they blend with their unrefined idiotic sense of humor to make some very awful movies there comes a point in this movie when a viewer cuts his losses as the scales tip from enthralling regionalism to repellent juvenile lowhumor which probably wasnt even funny when it last appeared vaudeville there isnt a gag in the coen canon that rises above cornball how theyve managed to parlay this into a respectable career is confounding only the bluegrass and gospel songs save this turkey from being totally dead in the water at the 30 minute mark all the energy has wheezed out of it forward momentum has completely expired and youre left with over an hour with no perceptible value whatevero bother,black_comedy
o brother this one is surely entertaining the most beautiful coen brothers moviethe screen play is so engaging that you almost feel traveling with the charactersthere are lot of good things about this movie acting and screen play are one of the most important but the two most powerful things which make this movie an unforgettable experience are its music and cinematography you might as well grab an ost of thisgeorge clooney and john turturro are great as always but strangely the performance i liked is of tim blake nelson he just fitin perfectly in the character the locations chosen of mississippi are visually stunning this like every other coen brothers movie can be enjoyed multiple timesthis is surely 8 out of 10visually stunning peace of art,black_comedy
it is stated that the story line is loosely based on the odyssey but what about the wizard of oz figure it out  the most obvious one is kkk meeting there a number of others either in cinematography or verbally how many are there i believe i have spotted at least four others i would be curious as to whether or not you would agree and i ask if you know the reason why there are that many references to the wizard of oz by the coens regarding the music it has a stand alone property based on the awards picked up at the country music awards and the grammy for soundtrack i would have to put this one ahead of many other coen films simply because of all of the elements,black_comedy
the kkk scene where everettdelmer and pete ambush the color guard to save tommy was exactly like the scene in the wizard of oz whens the tin man scare crow and lion ambushed the color guard to save dorothy anyone else notice i guess they were trying to depict kkk members as monkeys this movie becomes more interesting in each viewing i have watched it several times and pick up some new detail every time i see it also i think the tim blake nelson version of in the jailhouse now is the best ive ever heard better than the original or any other recordings of the tune that have hit the charts such as the webb pirce version why hasnt tim pursued a singing career further jillayne hutchinson,black_comedy
i was genuinely surprised when i watched this movie  i thought it was going to be altogether different than what it was   everyone in this movie seemed to be perfectly cast in their respected roles this is one of the best movies i have seen in a while  also the soundtrack was absolutely great  this movie definitely deserves a strong 9 out of 10,black_comedy
one commenter said that he could tell the people who enjoyed this movie dont get out much  thats pretty arrogant  the shattuck theater in berkeley was full of people who must not get out much thentrue to coen form the movie exemplifies what i like about indie films its quirky  it doesnt conform to an approved plot formula  its experimental  i can pay 800 for a movie like that absolutely hate the film and still feel that the chance was worth taking  turns out i thoroughly enjoyed o brother so thats like getting a bonusbut the next friggin mel gibson historical whitewash or the next tom hanks 2hour cliche or the next billy crystal meg ryan syrupy romantic comedy had better be onthemoney or ill feel i got ripped offso if you want to go see what everyone else is seeing so you can like what everyone else liked and jabber about the same stupid characters reshot ad nauseam then you probably want to stay away from anything like this movie go rent sleepless in seattle for the 100th time and stay in bed  god forbid you should risk seeing a bad moviebut if you like seeing something different from time to time then get to the theater pony up your eight bucks and watch the movie   youll probably enjoy it  if you dont you can still feel thankful for the opportunity just dont let some arrogant film snob or some overrated tv fat guy tell you youre not supposed to like it,black_comedy
the first time i saw this movie it didnt seem to go anywhere when i watched it a second time though it made a lot more sense give it a chance watch it more than once there are a lot of key elements that shape the story that could be missed the first and even second time watching it the cohen brothers brilliantly weave actual happenings of the early 20th century into this story to make a believable setting and storyline the combination of clooneys leading role blends well with turturro and nelsons supporting acts john goodmans appearance in the movie is hilarious the soundtrack is great as well this movie has become a household favorite for my family 1010 for sure,black_comedy
there is only one deep south and that is mississippi this movie grabs and clutches at raw truth of the southern mindset it does not matter if the outsider to the mississippi way of life and culture disagrees or perhaps is even revolted what matters is the documentation and depiction of the deep south as shown in this movie oh how it rattles ones cage ie the kkk yet beautifully depicts history and tradition that was locked in and intractable to a certain way of lifethe music is haunting and cleansing at the same time the song down to the river to pray one feels the baptism to ones very soul ah yes ones soulevery actor and actress stripped bare for its audience the raw truth of the deep south and its culture for an era gone byi will unabashedly call this movie oh brother where art thou a classicleta,black_comedy
i thought this movie was great i saw this when it came out in the theaters so i do not remember all the details i remember it being based on homers tale on odysseus names places and events are changed but you can still see the resemblance to the tale i found it funny how they would get themselves into trouble and how they would get themselves out of it i really enjoyed this version of modernized old tales much better than the romeo and juliet with clair danesi will agree that in some parts of the tale it does get a little to silly at times but all in all it is a great adventure with some big name actors,black_comedy
the coen brothers are probably americas most creative minds in recent years as shown by the many projects they have brought for our benefit in order to entertain us as with all creative persons some films are extraordinary some are excellent and a few miss the mark having seen the film in its original release we were fortunate to see again in dvd format recently with o brother where art thou the coens are at their best joel and ethan coen gathered one of the best group of performers to be in the film george clooney is seen as ulysses or odysseus in the greek epic the man at the center of the action never has this actor been given this great opportunity and he has responded in ways that bowled us in watching him portray his character on the screen to say this is his best work in the movies is perhaps not saying anything at all mr clooney can thank the coens for trusting in him and giving him the role of his careerthe rest of the cast is perfection most of the players are part of the coens troupe of talented players at their disposal to give life to their characters in film john turturro john goodman and holly hunter have been in other films by the brothers and shine in this movie tim blake nelson charles durning del pentecost and daniel von bargen among others do extraordinary work for the coen teamthe musical score by t bone burnett is what makes this movie unique the use of the music works so well with the film as does mr clooneys singing roger deakins cinematography also adds a rich texture to the story a must see for all coen brothers fans,black_comedy
although not a big coen brothers fan i am an admirer of their dark humor films like fargo and millers crossing i have been much less impressed by their other comic mode goofycamp or is that camp goofy unfortunately o brother where art thou falls into the latter category and isnt even as good as the big lebowski or the hudsucker proxyo brother is basically an episodic series of injokes without much point and not all that much humor or cleverness either as most reviewers have noted the films plot is very loosely  and as far as i could tell quite arbitrarily  based on the odyssey its main character ulysses everett mcgill george clooney is an adventurer like his homeric namesake and has as his real goal the return home to prevent the marriage of his wife penny to a suitor of course we dont discover that this is what the clooneyulysses character really wants until long after weve stopped caring and what does homer have to do with cool hand luke chain gangs ku klux klan meetings a la indiana jones cult gatherings a disbarred lawyers vocabulary a talent for bluegrass country music singing an association with baby face nelson a clark gable lookalike hairdo and other random and sundry character traits and encounters i leave that for others to discernthe allusion to preston sturges sullivans travels in o brothers title is equally pointless yes viewers familiar with the sturges minor screwball comedy classic might find it mildly rewarding to recognize the title of the socially conscious depression movie sullivan abandons hollywood and comedy hoping to make and they might even be mildly amused by a couple of shotscene riffs eg hopping freight cars and the chain gang shuffle into view a movie but so what the coen brothers dont seem to have anything to add to the artforartssake versus moral high seriousness critical debate about the function of art they obviously fall into the former school but that doesnt seem to motivate the reference in the slightest is it an homage if so why make it i like postmodern pop culture reference and textual play as much as the next person but its a lot nicer when it amounts to something at least tonally if not thematically consistent  and not just an arbitrary concoctionthis screenplay is simply a silly mess the only consistent and consistently pleasing element is the folkcountry music soundtrack it doesnt have much to do with homer or preston sturges but considering the rest of the film thats probably a good thing on the other hand id recommend using the price of admission on the soundtrack cd,black_comedy
how could this movie have come from the writer and director of fargo and the big lebowski i was shattered during the screening and left the cinema in a state of shock it would be easy to blame clooney as he ruins every movie but this was a deeper problem it failed in so many areas especially the scriptperhaps the only ray of light was john goodman who continually impresses me with his acting im prepared to give the coens more chances because of the awesome material they have produced in the past but this will scar me for a while,black_comedy
o brother where art thou has to be one of the most dull confused and laughable movies ive ever had the misfortune to see  it is awful  it follows three escaped prisoners in stripy costumes getting into one misadventure after another it is very distressing to see the coen brothers make such a bad movie  i absolutely love fargo and the big lebowski is pretty good but please dont bother renting this  youll only be disappointed by it,black_comedy
this the coens weakest movie that ive seen its not really a movie in the traditional sense more like a series of sketches strung together rather tenuously what makes it work is the immense likability of the 3 leads and some genuinely hilarious moments what doesnt is its length and the broken nature of the plot you could leave during the screening return in 10 minutes and it really wouldnt matter perhaps if id seen this before some the coens more accomplished recent films i wouldnt have felt so let down the scenarios that our 3 protagonists find themselves in grow more surreal and ridiculous as the film progresses and then bizarrely for the last half an hour its extended into a kind of boring melodrama before fading out with a whimper,black_comedy
ok most people seemed to like this movie but personally i hated it  i know it is a parody of the oddysey but i didnt notice too many similarities  also the whole idea that three guys break out of a chain gang seeking treasure and somehow manage to create a blue grass band that becomes very well liked just doesnt make much sense the fact that the whole movie has blue grass music in it does not do much for me  i have heard it has been recognized for its music but if you arent a big bluegrass fan then this moive can be somewhat of a turn off as it was for me  i dont really care for george clooney in a not serious role  i think he is a very fine actor in oceans eleven but as a convict he isnt too convincing  this movie recieved two and a half stars from ebert and roper or whoever and frankly i would have to agree with the rating  to me o brother where art thou was simply a mediocre movie,black_comedy
i havent seen many of the coen brothers films although one of the two i have seen is one of my favorites fargo and the other ive seen is one i dont care for very much o brother where art thou one of the films has a lot of humor the other doesnt one of the films is extremely entertaining the other is just sort of boringa retelling of homers odyssey or homers odyssey since you never see the title without the name preceding it anymore homers name is practically part of the title now am i digressing it starts with three runaway convicts ulysses everett mcgill george clooney pete john turturro and delmer tim blake nelson everett  as his chumps call him  has a strange fascination with his own hair and dapper dan hair cream im a dapper dan man he proclaims after being offered another brand of hair cream by a store clerk who unfortunately doesnt carry dapper dan but looks as if he couldnt give a hoot either way and in another one of the films few funny scenes we see local police picking up a trail on the threesome after a bloodhound finds a tin can of dapper dan and a hairnet lying by a diminished firethe trio has escaped from jail in hopes of finding an ancient treasure not delved into by the film so very much along the way they meet an odd assortment of characters including a black guitarist who sold his soul to satan so that he could learn to play guitar a babyfaced criminal trying to make a name for himself and a bulky thief john goodman who steels what little fortunes the men have achieved by singing on the radio under the combined name of the soggy bottom boysalong the way they also encounter everetts wife holly hunter who claims he was hit by a train tells her seven children this and refuses to acknowledge him as her husband with the law in hot pursuit of them the boys have only their brains to fall back on  and they dont have much of that available for usethe plots not the problem with the film per se it has fun with itself the bluegrass music is perfect for the film and makes you feel like youre in mississippi the problem is the way the film has a million different ideas going on that it never seems able to make sense of the film takes spiritual detours that pay off at the end but nothing is ever truly resolved in one scene towards the overdue finale everett gets down on his knees and prays to god to deliver them from their doom suddenly a gigantic tidal wave roars through and demolishes their surroundings leaving them alive and bobbing on the waters surfaceive read the odyssey but even with all its weirdness in mind i dont remember it being this weird its been a while yes but i dont remember a giant tidal wave and i certainly dont think it belongs in a feature film with enough wasted ideas at least the odyssey was weird for a reason  o brother where art thou could certainly do without the strangenessevery time george clooney is onscreen youll be having some minimal amount of fun at least but when hes gone and the film takes its time rooting through some unimportant subplots it gets to be a real bore its not even two hours long but it feels like its threethe plus side depressionera mississippi comes alive and in some scenes the dry filming makes you thirsty for a glass of cold water not only that but just as in fargo the coen brothers are able to make us feel a sort of attachment to the characters  but even with everetts funny infatuation with hair gel hes not in the same league as marge gunderson and he never will bethe first time i saw this movie in 2000 the year of its release i absolutely hated it back then perhaps i was expecting something too close to fargo maybe i just wanted something better so with last nights repeat viewing i made sure i wasnt expecting anything i made sure i put away all pretensions it still didnt impress meo brother where art thou does have some good parts but for being a comedy it certainly doesnt have very many laughs and for being a lightweight uplifting drama it seems too caught up in darker ideas that dont need meddling with and apart from everything else its just plain weird its a whole lot different than fargo which might sound good since change is often welcomed from directors but whereas m night shyamalans signs was different than the sixth sense in a delightfully splendid way sort of like george lucas latest installments into the extended star wars series they may be different but theyre definitely not any better255 starsjohn ulmer,black_comedy
i rented this movie purely because it was rated by imdb as 7810 boy was i disappointed i thought the music was the best part much better than the humor i started it one night and gave up i came back the next day and tried to finish it and gave up again i thought it was a real waste of time although i could see lots of of attempts at humor a guy breaks off a dead branch from and tree and smacks an idiot in the face with it his buddy watches this happen and sits still while the guy then bashes this second guy in the face some of the food he was eating flops out of his mouth as he falls a little funny there over maybe it picks up in the last half hour dont say no one tried to warn you,black_comedy
i was looking forward to seeing this well reviewed movie  was i ever disappointed pros  the actors did a great job with the material they had  the ending was a lot of fun  the music was fantastic cons  the computer generated backdrops i found extremely irritating  ulysses matched his famous predecessor in bravado but not in brains or bravery  i like characters that develop that learn something even in a comedy  ive seen this kind of slapstick a thousand times it did nothing original even though it feebly alluded to literature  poor homer i give it a 2 out of 10 but only because of the marvellous soggybottom boys,black_comedy
how blessed we are with the current blizzard of fine filmsspoilers hereinhere the coens embark on their most ambitious effort yet playing with multiple dualitiesthe real world and a  magical reality of myththe world of performance and the world of politicsthe stories of song and those of imagethe lovely bright yellow land of the south and the unlovely people who partly covered itin the center of each duality they placed the pretense of our trio moving through what goethe said of ulysses was an apprentice voyage clooney will really be ped when he realizes how these guys goofed on him turturro is a long time coenite who understands their light regard for the patina of entertainment the ordinary viewer expects in fact he has just come off of two rather ambitious projects concerned with just these four dualities and the complex role of the actor in weaving them into apparent entertainment his remarkable illuminata which he funded wrote and directed and tim robbins similar but more political project cradle will rock turturro is becoming a phenomenon real intelligencetim blake nelson participated in the highly adventurous hamlet of last year tilted toward just such an issue  with hamlet as a film student musing about these dualities he then took julia stiles the ophelia and directed the forthcoming o a version of othello that is held up i understand because it is too intelligent he has written and directed other films which i havent seen but eye of god written and directed by him is supposed to also be about this same stuff natch all the bright filmmakers are buzzing about these issues together turturro and nelson play the game of switching realities while both clooneys character and clooney are oblivious the title is from a sturges filmwithinafilm same issues  everything revolves around the chicken dancea small complaint the symbol of blindness was too heavihanded much as with woody allen in crimes and soggy bottom joyce,black_comedy
thatok the coen path is still here but i found this film very boring yes the plans are beautiful the actors are good the music is ok and sometimes it is funny so there is somethingbut fargo or the big lebowski were far better ,black_comedy
a while back i read that this movie had been tested and tweaked many times before its releasea bad sign there are really just two problems with this movie theres no plot and it isnt funny its been a long time since i looked at my watch repeatedly during a movie and i really didnt expect that that could happen in a movie made by the same guys who did fargo millers crossing blood simple and raising arizona so if you absolutely gotta see a prison break movie do yourself a favor skip this and rent cool hand luke instead,black_comedy
i am a huge fan of the coen brothers and am constantly introducing people to raising arizona one of the most underrated comedies everi went into o brother with high expectationsthe coens john turturro john goodman even holly hunter i could even manage george clooney under the sure hand of the coensbut this movie is awful not funny except in about five very short places dull dull dull way too many drawnout scenes with blues or bluegrass music playing over depression scenes with absolutely nothing happening about an hour into the movie i was experiencing the worst feeling possible during a moviei just wanted it to be overthe completely pointless interaction with george nelson dont call him babyface was a waste of michael badaluccos talents holly hunter she was in the credits but was not in the movie essentiallyi laughed four times during the whole movie here are the spoilers when john goodman hit george clooney with the stick during the do not seek the treasure scene during the original singing scene at the radio station and at john turturros dancing during the final singing scenedont waste your time unless as i did you have to see this at the behest of a girlfriend,black_comedy
frankly i dont see how this movie has been given such a high rating on imdb  maybe the people who have voted need to really watch it again and pay really close attentionespecially to the lack of a plot and storylinesure the movie has a ton of subplots which could be a good thing  ill give it that much  however the subplots lead nowhere and dont add up to anything  the main plot is just as shallow as only parts of it are revealed hidden within the different and to put it nicely unique charactersthe characters are shallow and flat  you know nothing about them except that they have run away or runoft from their prisonconflict  every movie and book has one  every great story has a conflict that leads up to a climax and resolution  however o brother where art thou lacks this trait and tends to rely on subplots such as the sirens and the ku klux klan rather than staying with its central plot  this gets really annoying twenty minutes within the film when the viewer is left behind just like the three escaped convicts were left behind the trainthe movie is classified as comedy  i found nothing funny about dragging people through a tedious dimwitted movie without even living up to its own genre,black_comedy
this movie is absolutely terrible and this is coming from a guy who used to hail the coen brothers as cinematic geniuses ie blood simple raising arizona and fargoi didnt laugh i didnt care about the plot i felt nothing for the characters and quite honestly it took everything i had to finish watching this piece of garbage  oh well that about sums it up  later,black_comedy
oh brother where art thou  is ostensibly based on homers the odyssey but i have no reason to doubt the coen brothers when they say that theyve never actually read it  the film really has nothing to do with that epic poem other than the fact that the filmmakers throw plot elements from the original haphazardly into the mix every now and then  need a cyclops dress john goodman up in an eye patch to no point or purpose  sirens  have the main characters stumble across three beautiful women singing and washing clothes by a riverside even though the scene seems totally contrived and arbitrary in the context of the story  the coen brothers lack of familiarity with the original is only too apparentactually this is one of their worst films no doubt about it  slow arch disjointed and heavyhanded in both its plotting and its humor  the original odyssey was an epic tale filled with adventure high drama and great themes involving issues of courage pride commitment and love  oh brother is none of these  it is in fact silly cramped and trivial  the role of ulysses has been assigned to george clooney as the leader of a trio of convicts who escape from a chain gang in the depression era midwest  as they roam the countryside they encounter a myriad of bizarre eccentric characters some derived loosely from the odyssey and some not  none of it really works partly due to the arbitrariness of the plotting and partly due to the fact that the humor is not very well executed  in fact most of the wit consists of having the actors overplay their facial expressions and accents  as a result of these two factors the strain never ceases to showso are there any good things to be found in oh brother  well the movie does look good thanks to fine cinematography and art direction which beautifully capture the look of the dusty rural countryside of the 1930s and there is of course the occasional joke or idea that actually does work despite the fact that the film as a whole is a major disappointment perhaps in the case of this particular coen brothers film the title is inadvertently symbolic,black_comedy
i was really ready to enjoy this movie after reading some very positive reviews for it and hearing it was weird and funny i decided to rent it it had competition from the likes of space cowboys meet the parents crouching tiger and nurse betty all of which i couldve rented but i felt confident somehow this movie was going to be worth my money but it was quite a mistake i made although this movie looked beautiful it was boring and often made no sense i didnt laugh once it was definitely weird and unusual but not worth the money to see it was completely pointless maybe i just didnt get it perhaps youll like it i guess its a love it or hate it kind of movie thank you for reading this review,black_comedy
ok  so i caught on to the loose parallels with the odyssey the sirens john goodman as the cyclops holly hunter as penelope maybe i missed something but the whole odyssey thing seemed like forced clevernessthe movie came across as a collection of hollow stereotypes that managed to expose the coen brothers obvious contempt for the culture of the rural south because they are so out of touch with the people about whom they wrote the lines often came out lifeless and flat particularly with turtorro who was totally miscast as a hillbilly he sounded like he picked up his southern accent from watching episodes of foghorn leghorn also  i though hillbilly music literally came from the hills  appalachia  not the mississippi deltai would be interested to see the coen brothers turn their vicious parody machine on a culture with which they have some familiarity  say jewish culture could you imagine if a couple of southern boys had made a film that brought to life all of the negative stereotypes associated with new york jews  perhaps set against the musical stylings of gershwins tin pan alleythe movie came across as slightly too meanspiritednot one of their better efforts in my opinion,black_comedy
if it wasnt for the awsome songs in this movie i wouldnt have been able to get through it one of the all time worst i cant beleive how bad it was i just wanted to rip my arm off so i would have something to throw at the movie screen was not worth the money to see it,black_comedy
this is an awful filmbut first an historical note  the confederate battle flag is the centerpiece of an ugly scene in this film involving the ku klux klan  for the record the confederate battle flag was never associated with the ku klux klan during its heyday  if you take the time to look at any of the news reels from the 1920s and 1930s including film clips of the thousands of robed klansmen marching down washington dcs constitution avenue the only flag you will see is old glory  the confederate battle flag was misappropriated in the late 1950s and in the 1960s by groups opposing the integration of the public schools and later by the handful of yahoos in this country who claim to be sepratists and aryans ad nauseum  the point is that hollywoods fixation on the confederate battle flag as a symbol of evil is a continuing slander on the memory of millions of americans who fought for independencebut back to the film  i dislike the coens because they are not just mannered they are pretentious  come on folks  be honest  the coens are indulging themselves  and we that small slice of the moviegoing public with the brain cells to write a review are letting them get away with itthe story  what story  its just a series of scenes  unless you know something about southern american history the movie makes absolutely no sense  even then its a reach  the story takes place in mississippi but the real governor pappy pass the biscuits please odaniel was a texan and the films theme song you are my sunshine was written by louisianas depressionera governor jimmy davis  symptomatic with the way hollywood views the south i suppose the coens are trying to cover it all in one filmthe characters  george clooney is laughable as ulysses everett mcgill this man obviously never spent one day on a chain gang or one day in the south pretend or otherwise  burt reynolds would have been better but then the art house crowd would never have gone for it  holly hunter  her pained expressions were all too real i am afraid  she has no direction no scenes no lines no personality and no interest in the film  and what a waste  shes a real southerner with a real southern charm and attitudetim blake nelson as delmar odonnell is just too painful to watch  he had me wishing the witches had turned him into a toad  but on the other hand he represents the coens view of southern people so his performance is not atypical  charles durning is completely wasted as gov odaniel  the man has some range but here he is just a onenote blowhard  remember him in the sting and in tootsie  john goodman  oh pleasei did not care about any of the characters  i thought the coens were going to do something with tommy johnson played by chris thomas thinking perhaps that he would be the coens version of leadbelly but he makes no contribution  we know nothing about him  in the end hes just a black guy with a guitar  michael baldaccis turn as baby face nelson is fillernot surprisingly it is hard to like anybody in this film which is characteristic of a film by the coensthe film did win a couple of oscars including one for cinematography but how  many of the daytime scenes are hazy and desperately in need of a filter and those outdoor shots that are attractive are no more attractive than the outdoor scenes you see in a typical episode of the crocodile hunteri wonder what tim burton is up to these days,black_comedy
this is another example of a film that once again fails to live up to its relatively good premise imdb plot summary three escaped convicts search for hidden treasure while a relentless lawmen pursues them that is all i was looking for  a nice little cat and mouse chase with laughter and fun thrown in throughout the film  sadly you get none of that hereim aware that this film has been adapted from homers odyssey but im not going to claim i know much about this work i am aware that some of the characters and scenarios depicted in this film are based on this odyssey but does that make it a good film god no the problem with this film is that many characters are introduced and then disappear seemingly without any point or purpose lets look at a few examplesgeorge nelson  a mobster whose character is presumably meant to be some kind of parody of baby face nelson whose real name is also george nelson his character arrives and the only memorable scene involving his character and our trio of fugitives was a rather disgusting scene which involved him shooting cattle and then their pursuers running a couple of cattle over is this meant to be funny it was pretty sick if you ask me his character is then randomly introduced at the end when hes arrested and sentenced to death  again possibly a parable of the life of the real life character tommy johnson  a hitchhiker that our trio pick up who has sold his soul to the devil he then quickly disappears and then reappears later in the film when hes captured by the kkk who wish to sacrifice him because he sold his soul to the devil i honestly couldnt believe how stupid it all wasdan teague  a religious fanatic whose character served no real purpose in the film other than to shock the audience i like john goodman but his presence in this film wasnt enough to save this catastrophe of a filmadded to a whole host of pointless characters the coens also present you with a screenplay thats a complete mess  theyd go from one scene to the next without any sort of logical connection as ive mentioned characters are introduced and then disappear without any real explanation and then are reintroduced in the most ridiculous and contrived of ways factor all of this with a stupid sub plot involving two government officials both fighting to win peoples vote what the hell did that have to do with anything also i thought this was meant to be a film where the fugitives are being pursued did anyone really get the feeling that they were actually being chased i think i only saw the law enforcement official about 3 times during the entire 105 minute running timei would have forgiven most of the above if the film had even been remotely funny but it couldnt even fulfil that basic need we have the running joke of runoft is that supposed to be a joke about how people speak in the deep south or is the joke that they are thick and are unable to spell that was lost on me then theres the scene at the start where our trio of fugitives randomly enter an establishment and start singing into a pan what the hell was that all about i kept scratching my head and wondering if i just didnt get itthe main failings of this film are simply that theres too much going on too many characters who serve no purpose too many sub plots it wasnt remotely funny poor chemistry between the 3 leads i think the coens may possibly have been trying to weave stories together but it doesnt work because theres just too much going on and too much for the average viewer to take in the only positive i took from this was the initial scene with the blind man on the rail road where he says theres a fortune out there but theres a long road ahead of you to reach that fortune its clever because it makes the audience believe one thing but by the end its interpreted as something else that is the only positive that i got from this film,black_comedy
the coen brothers are very gifted filmmakers considering some of my all time favorite movies including fargo blood simple and raising arizona were products of their excessive capability of making good productions only contributes to the enormous disappointment of their latest effort oh brother where art thau it is as if they took several bad actors to play bad characters thrown in a bad script with bad dialogue and bad situations everything about this movie is bad bad bad bad the movie is a complete waste of 106 minutes of your life it makes sitting on the couch watching survivor look good i am sorry to say this but i may hold this one against the coen brothers for some time to comeoh brother where art thau is your standard roadbuddy comedy but missing comedy laughs insight and interest the story feels tedious yawninducing slowmoving and ridiculously stupid it takes place in 1937 in mississippi where three convicts escape from a pretty chain gang they are ulysses everett mcgill george clooney delmar time blake nelson and pete john turturro who quickly find themselves discussing their dreams with a crazy blind seer this man explains the three escapees must travel a long and difficult path before they find a treasure at the bottom of a lake in four days being the absolute idiots they are pete mcgill and delmar find themselves following the advice of this clearly eccentric drifterthe three idiots are pursued by various other characters including a local sheriff daniel von bargen whos bound and determined to bring the criminals to justice a young musician chris thomas king who sold his soul to the devil in exchange for musical abilities george baby face nelson michael badalucco a manic depressive bank robber with machine guns up the wazoo big dan teague john goodman a deceptive oneeyed bible salesman and incumbent governor pappy odaniel charles durning in a close campaign with homer stokes wayne duvall whose manager ray mckinnon is married to mcgills exwife penny holly hunteroh brother where art thau is a moronic shadow of of mice and men minus the legitimate plot and defined character intentions this film contains the most annoying of characters they are bland boring dual dumb negativeadjective inspiring what is that you say the movies intentions were to induce laughs through the stupidity of the characters well if that were the case i think i would have laughs or even smiled at that i found myself moaning and groaning in disgust and agony not a single character is the least bit intriguing that is one of the biggest problems the movie makes finding a character in which audiences can relate maybe if the characters were introduced or developed or had the slightest interesting personality then there may have been some involvementalbeit not muchthe dialogue is typical redneck blahblah wooden and straightforward there is little creativity or sharpness in the writing the screenplay by joel and ethan coen based on a poem by homer puts you right to sleep especially in the scenes where the outlaws sit around campfires exchanging depressing meaningless gibber jabber the soundtrack is equally as painful consisting of irritating oldfashion country music and even some numbers sang by the characters themselves those scenes dragged on way too long are irrelevant to the story all of these horrible qualities precede an ending that is not satisfying and inconclusiveoh brother where art thau is just a really dumb movie there is no other way to explain the quality it is just really dumb not in a funny way not in a slapstick way not even in a bad movie sort of way it is inexplicably dumb dumb dumb dumb oh yeah did i mention that this movie is dumb still considering going to see this junk fine but do not say i didnt warn you,black_comedy
on seeing the shorts to this film i decided against it because it seemed very annoying especially george clooneys exaggerated facial expressions however a friend told me that if i liked fargo which i loved id also like this one since then ive significantly reevaluated my judgment of this friends taste it was just as annoying as the shorts suggested for quite a while i was waiting for the story to turn around and improve but it was a long uninteresting story that finished too late the characters were unlikeable and the jokes were painfully obvious ive seen more sophisticated plots and humour in most dukes of hazard episodesthe only redeeming features were beautiful scenery and some nice music but surely we have a right to expect a bit more of a movie than that,black_comedy
im a fan of the coens since barton fink and for me fargo is one of the best movies ever but i dont get this movie it sucks it sucks hard i havent laughed once and i hated all this singing it made the movie slow too long and boring there isnt more to say just dont rent it ,black_comedy
i watched this film because i was told that i would be crying with laughter instead i barley laughed once the main characters were just awful you had two stupid characterspete and delmar and one intelligent charactereverett usually this could work but pete and delmar were so stupid it simply was not funny it was like they only knew about 20 words and half the time it was just everett talking and them looking back gormless the only thing positive about the film was it had some catchy songs i would not go out of my way to watch this film nor would i recommend it to anyone if its on tv and its a sunday and you can not find the remote then by all means watch it but otherwise its a big no,black_comedy
smug condescending snide and infantile nothing new for the coens the only mystery is why oh why are they so beloved by cinemaphiles the coens remind me of that spoiled rich kid who always thought they were smarter wittier and more hip than everybody else yes they have intelligence but to what end so they can always show how superior they are to display how above it all they think they might be,black_comedy
this is one of those movies that everyone who failed lit 101 thinks is great because its boring and they cant understand it just like they found all those classical pieces they read and never understood well just because its boring and you cant understand it doesnt make it good it is in fact a genuinely awful film that claims to be based on the odyssey by homer right just like charlie manson is a christ figure one bright spot the movie is perfect for george clooney  its so bad one hardly notices that he as usual displays no acting talent,black_comedy
first saw this coen brothers movie around the time it came out or shortly after it was released for rental  i cant remember wrote it off as a disappointing film one of several from the brothers whose work is inconsistent sometimes great but all too frequently fair or nothing specialhowever some friends kept mentioning it quoting lines from it cracking each other up saying that  like monty pythons holy grail  it grows on you so i gave it another chanceoh wellthe second time around i found it worse than disappointing i found it offensive the movie should be rated r for the number of times it takes the lords name in vain i almost turned it off but as im apt to do no matter how bad a movie is i stuck it out until the bitter end which means i had to suffer through the blasphemous kkk sceneo brother where art thou doesnt work as a comedy i know i didnt laugh and am not even sure i smiled or as a drama it lacks a sympathetic character tim blake nelson comes the closest and its hard not to like holly hunter in anything or even any memorable scenesyes there are the typical coen brothers eccentric characters and references to classic stories homer and movies like cool hand luke but instead of enhancing this film or honoring the past they just dont work i suppose  as my friends mentioned  there are some repeatable lines smugly delivered by george clooneys character no surprise there but why would one want to be reminded of this forgetful film,black_comedy
the coen brothers homage to hollywoods screwball comedies of the 1930s and a giddy wink to the various depressionera southern motifs depicted in literature and film as such the coens give us a film awash with the flavours of 1930s louisiana as mediated by 70 years of accumulated myth their vision is categorically not a depiction of the real south but rather a demented postmodern take on an imaginary south encountered only in print and filmchain gangs baptisms kkk rallies unwashed yokels farm houses corrupt politicians bank robbers blues musicians who sell their souls at the crossroads bonnie and clyde carchases the march of progress as symbolised by the spread of electricity and radio etc etcthe film is filled with little moments and anecdotes drawn from not history but arts impression of history its a copy of a copy paper thin and with the weight of a laminated photographif all coen flicks are postmodern homages then this one is an affectionate nod to the preston sturges comedy sullivans travels in that film a director sets out to make an important picture called o brother where art thou instead of a comedy for once but then ends up realising that he should stick to what he does best theres a lot to be said for making people laugh sullivan says dont you know thats all some people haveso in utilising sullivans proposed film title for their own spoof the coens are suggesting that it will contain some highminded artistic content too adding in some obviously pretentious and inappropriate references to homer provide the coens with just the metaparodic hook theyre looking for in this regard the final film contains many amusing parallels with homers odyssey these include scenes with sirens a cyclops blind men and a mockingly selfimportant based on the odyssey by homer credit all of which serve as a sort of formalist metajoke 710  there are some good sequences here like a kkk ceremony which is reenacted as a mgm musical parody but the entire film is weighed down by its cartoonishness elsewhere the films selfconsciously clever windowdressing serves only to inflate what is essentially a jaunty lark about yokels which is of course the point of most coen flicks worth two viewings,black_comedy
the coen brothers successfully transformed the epic poem the odyssey into a movie through their full screen spectacle o brother where art thou for example both pieces begin with blind prophets who describe future occurrences through predictions in o brother where art thou the prophet is revealed to be the blind man on the train tracks predicting the future of the three fugitives in the odyssey there are many prophets such as muse theoclymenes helen and tiresias who often describe the impending doom of the suitors and odysseus return in addition in both pieces there are sirens who attempt to stir the main characters supporting crew in o brother where art thou the sirens are located at a lake persuading pete to follow them leading to his eventual arrest in the odyssey the sirens are directly in the path of odysseus on his way home they attempt to persuade him to follow them but his crew strictly restrains him and they eventually pass through unharmed thirdly both pieces contain a strong antagonist cyclops who approaches the main characters kindly and quickly turn hostile in o brother where art thou this antagonist is represented by the oneeyed big dan he kindly tells them that he is willing to sell them atonement for their sins through the bible and turns hostile by physically assaulting them and killing their frog in the odyssey the antagonist is represented by the cyclops who begins his part in the story as a hospitable creature but later turns hostile when eating two of odysseus crew matesin addition to the meeting of the two cyclopss both pieces of work show the physical pain caused by the protagonist on the antagonist in o brother where art thou during the ku klux klan meeting big dan is killed by evrett when the flaming cross falls on him in the odyssey odysseus blinds the cyclops with a flaming spear during his imprisonment in the cyclops cave another similarity between the two pieces is the protagonists wifes plan to remarry in o brother where art thou evretts wife penny plans on remarrying a suitor in the odyssey odysseus wife penelope plans on remarrying one of the many suitors occupying her home lastly in both pieces the main character enlists the help of his friends before the final eventful scene in o brother where art thou evrett promises loyalty and fair treatment to pete and delmar before entering the church and trying to stop the wedding in the odyssey odysseus promises to treat the cowherd and swineherd as children if they aid him in his final battle with the suitors in conclusion the similarities between the two pieces of work prove the successful translation from the odyssey to o brother where art thou i am a total buttface,black_comedy
this movie presents all things about the 1930s everything is so brilliant the story is great the actors like clooney or goodman play fantastic and roger deakins did marvelous the work of the director of photography wonderful landscapes and a lot of professional pictures the portrayal and the characters are very entertaining the coen brother made great yeah the music was great too the country songs typify the mood of the us in 1930sthe connection with the odyssey shows itself in many times 1 the cyclops was big dan who got the car of ulysses and delmar 2 the sirens were the three girls by the river 3 the lotuseaters were the baptists in the forest 4 when ulysses sleeps something bad happens 5 the journey in the underworld was like the theater scene 6 in the restaurant where ulysses and delmar brought the frog in there was a statue about homeri can only offer this movie for everyone its a great entertainment go to the dvd library and watch it you will have a wonderful experience,black_comedy
this depression era period piece is simply a delight the music is wonderful the fanciful on the road story of lovable escaped convict country bumpkins who pratfall their way through numerous scrapes invites hilarity and the beautifully dovetailed script by the coen brothers is marvelousthat script was nominated for the oscar for best screenplay based on material from another medium for 2001 but didnt win stephen gaghan won for traffic but never mind the writing is just so clever and that is part of what makes this movie so much fun to watchthat wont surprise viewers who are familiar with the work of ethan and joel coen those guys are strikingly original talents who can write comedy and noir with the best of them as in eg raising arizona 1987 blood simple 1984their first and in some ways their bestand of course fargo 1996 their work is characterized by irony satirical intent and sly plotting in which later events are foreshadowed by previous events especially replete with clever foreshadowing characters appear as they are wont to do in road movies or epic wanderings and then they are left behind as our heroes move on here however the first appearance of a character is probably not the last appearance when john goodman first appears as a morally and ethnicallychallenged bible salesman who welds a mean stick we may think he is gone but ill keep this vague when he reappears we are not surprised in fact his reappearance is just rightone of the highlights is george clooney as ulysses everett mcgill whose sweetsmelling dapper dan hair pomade plays a bit of a role in the plot he is perfect as a slicktalking hairnetwearing country wordsmith who could charm the birds out of the trees with the slickedback hair and the thin moustache he reminded me a bit of clark gable which is only right since gable was a thirties film star whose style was much imitatedclooney is supported by john turturro who has played in at least two other coen and coen movies that i have seen he is one of those nonglamorous actors who is at the top of the profession it may seem a bit of a casting stretch to play him as a mississippi bumpkin but he pulls it off this is the same guy who was just perfect as a new york jewish writer gone to hollywood in coen and coens barton fink 1991this is the first time ive seen tim blake nelson but he was also very good as the third country musketeer as usual the alluring holly hunter gives a solid performance as everetts estranged wife about to marry another man the mother of his six daughters but make no mistake about it clooney clearly steals the show and i am surprised he wasnt nominated for best actor he was really that good he did win a golden globe award and the music country bluegrass hillbilly gospel traditionaland i know not what elseis really at the heart of the flick when the soggy bottom boys come on with their i am a man of constant sorrow it really brings the house down the coens know this and so later in the movie when the boys appear on stage looking a little like zztop on a budget they reprise it to the delight of the mississippi folk at a political rally and really get the joint to jumpingand of course it all figures in the plot and how appropriate is that lyric for a depression era song i am a man of constant sorrow see this for both the coen brothers who know how to have fun with a movie and for george clooney who puts on a mighty good shownote over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book cut to the chaise lounge or i cant believe i swallowed the remote get it at amazon,black_comedy
the music is the best thing about this movie  attempts to lip synch to it are rather lame  for all the money it must have cost to make this movie like many hollywood movies the viewer feels very distant from any reality its trying to portray,black_comedy
given the very high ranking on imdb i was expecting something close to the quality of two other fabulous prisonprisoner movies the green mile and the shawshank redemption sadly this movie is middling at best among other problems this movie has no depth george clooney is out of his acting element it drags it is stiff and it is rather piecemeal the trappings of a quality good and funny movie are here but this one is hollow i am shocked that this is listed as the 161 best movie of all time on imdb i gave it a 510 maybe overly generous because i quite enjoyed fargo and raising arizona from the coens,black_comedy
one of the worst films of the year  the humor or lack thereof is lowbrow the acting mediocre  the script is jumbled discontinuous and inaccurate the acting talent clooney goodman et al is wastedclooney takes on another one of his trademark leaderofthepack roles searching for a large sum of money he stole away before being carted off to the penitentiary  he and his two southern sidekicks nose their way into a number of odd adventures on the wayperhaps the defining read worst moment of the film is when the three attend a kkk gathering  the scenes topic is too serious to be funny but too poorly done to be convincing  the resulting scene leaves the viewer unsure of how to react  usually eliciting a hesitant chuckle followed by a long confused silencei saw this movie in spain and the entire theatre agreed in a hearty unison when i concisely and audibly summed up the movie as the credits started to roll mierda,black_comedy
like many people i first became associated with the coen brothers through fargo they might have been the first filmmakers whose entire body of work i searched out and watched and i liked every one of them and then i was the first person in line to see their next film their previous film now the big lebowski and that one just added to their shining reputationand now some three and a half or so years later comes their next film o brother where art thou it has all the marks of a coen brothers movie but for some reason it doesnt work at all and i know why or at least i think i do what makes a coen brothers film distinct from a film of another director some would say quirkiness this is certainly part of it but people can copy quirkiness and have take being john malkovich it is possibly the quirkiest film ever made outside of the coen universe but no one would mistake it for a coen brothers film why is this well in my opinion which of course is informed it is the coen brothers sense of perfection and meticulousness both in the technical aspects the performances and the script technically o brother is a match for any of their other films the cinematography miseenscene sound and editing are great the script is the biggest problem it is bad not that there arent good ideas in there in fact any one of the episodes could have turned out to be hilarious possibly its just that there are too many episodes therefore each episode runs for approximately two minutes before it is over each episode comprises about one sequence and each sequence is composed of about two or three scenes take a look at millers crossing for example to compare the pace is slow o brother is not a short movie yet it feels that way and because of the sloppy script there are no performances to speak of really i like any one of the actors on screen but their characters even the character of george clooney are all one dimensional it isnt necessary to flesh out every character of a comedy but i think some of the more colorful supporting characters should have had more screentime more development john goodman should have had a more substantial part for instance although his southern accent is not very good and charles durnings part should have been better in fact the whole gubernatorial race part of the plot should have been more in focus i would have based the plot more around it rather than having it taking place in the corners the way the coens get rid of durnings opponent is just badthe only thing the film did get right is the music the main song that the escapees sing is just marvelous and all the other songs written by t bone burnett are excellent also in fact it would be a travesty if at least that main song didnt get nominated for an oscar it completely deserves it i would have given the film an alltime coen brothers low score of 410 710 being the former low the hudsucker proxy but i have to give it at least one point for the music so final score  510,black_comedy
yesterday i was watching preston sturges sullivans travels 1941 on dvd i had seen it years ago but hadnt remembered much including how good it is joel mccrea plays a hollywood director of comedies who wants to make a serious movie it would based on a book entitled o brother where art thou  well many years later the coen brothers have made a movie with that title but true to the spirit of sullivans travels it turns out to be a comedy not a preachy social tract if you liked o brother where art thou try to rent a copy of sullivans travels and if you liked sullivans travels by all means see o brother where art thou,black_comedy
praising a coen brothers movie because it has style is like praising an ice cream because its cold theres got to be more o brother where art thou has all the style a fan of the directing siblings can ask for but a little more substance wouldnt have hurt the filmtalent is a doubleedged sword the more you prove yourself capable to surprise the viewers to mesmerize them to please their eyes and challenge their intellect the more they expect from your next creation and after fargo perhaps the most universally acclaimed coen brothers movie and the big lebowksy a bizarre take on the noir genre whose brilliance sprung lately in our minds came o brother where art thou watching it i want to ask the two coens o brothers where were you a coen brothers comedy is an offer you cant refuse but there are many ways to play comedy goofy and borderlineparody like in raising arizona surrealistic and overthetop like in the big lebowsky bleak and engrossing like in barton fink and a serious man or dark and atmospheric like in fargo even in the socalled dramatic movies there was also a few scenes to channel their wicked twisted of humor but as far as comedy is concerned the case of obrother where art thou is puzzling it obviously tries to play on the raising arizona level with the atmosphere of sullivans travels in the background but the humor never really manages to hit that special chord so that you can follow the story with the confidence that this is going to be one hell of a bellylaugh rideand its even more puzzling because the film actually got the casting right the first shot with the three fugitives from a chain gang running and ducking in the midst of a cornfield is like borrowed from a 30s cartoon it successfully sets the tone something in the line of of mice and men and tex avery george clooney is a clowny version of george crossed with a clark gable wannabe his name is everett john turturro is pete a sort of lenny without the good heart and tim blake nelson is delmar a pintsized lenny without the strength and none of turturro or nelson even tries to steal clooneys thunder which leaves him enough space to display his comical abilities but theres not much given to him for instance theres one part where pete asks everett why hes the boss everett proposes a vote pete proposes himself so it all comes to delmar theres no time for him to come with a funny line their first encounter a black blind man driving a handcar on a railwayand this is only one of the many colorful tropes of the great depression era a time full of pastoral melancholy immortalized by so great classics interestingly many road movies the grapes of wrath bonnie and clyde bound for glory a time made popular through bluegrass music the sounds of banjo sepia tones and so many visually appealing details that its no wonder the coen brothers decided to venture into this chapter of america and where else than mississippi could they complete the picture with pies long railroads hobos in freighters a governor who look like the kfc old man and klan rallies a depression film is no depressing premise not when it is tackled by the coen brothers and cinematographer roger deakings so what went wrong exactly well the film is said to be adapted from homers odyssey while it gives the film a certain edge it doesnt really add much to the story as the coen brothers reckoned they didnt read the book so why handicapping a great premise with a needless framework are the coens so uninspired they couldnt make a story of their own in fact they did because nothing really evokes the odyssey apart from the sirens encounter penny the wife played by holly hunter is obviously penelope with her knitting habit but what do they add up besides simply reminding of the odyssey take the sirens part what does that part offer except from the recognition that they are the sirens i believe the film would have been more interesting had they stuck to an original screenplay with so many great characters they could but the film was just so busy loosely imitating a neverread book that it created a series of events enjoyable in their own terms but so inconsistent that even the resolutions feels a bit artificial and unconvincingat the end we enjoy it for the stars the atmosphere some religious moments are haunting the performances of john goodman as bible salesman and governor charles durning as papy odaniel and naturally the defining song of the film a man of constant sorrow i would lie if i said the film wasnt enjoyable every single department is well done but something is lacking in the whole aybe if it was made by other directors we would have been less critical the fact is the film was made after the big lebowksy and it just didnt compare still as a minor offering brother is never as good as when it takes departure from the whole odysseys outline and its homage to sullivans travels a film i didnt even like in the first place maybe thats why im so criticalnah its precisely because i have been so admiring of most of the coen brothers works that i allow myself to say this one made me a viewer of constant sorrow,black_comedy
god i admire this movie not only because its a free poetical interpretation of the odyssey but because its the best movie that describes a journey i love journeys i love trips more if i go with friendsand where art thou brother shines up coens maximal expansionist talent to make each character a fool and ridicule the environment and thats how half joke half serious the movie introduces us in a endless plateau of ridiculous characters fake obsessions and clowny language and three friends in the search of a treasure will find how the treasure itself is the hunt for itvisually striking meaningful great acting i hope i can find o brother such a quality film like these with such a sense of poetry again,black_comedy
hi folks sunny evening here in north italy nothing to do i have started to think about something special and less than one minute my mind fished a memory in my brain clooney turturro and blake nelson dancing with fake mustaches and singing u are my sunshine in front of old farmers and new politicians at the beginning of the last century just for that part of the movie the cohen bros must be legendary for everdid u ever cry for a comedy or for a ironic movie about me i cried a lot only for jarmusch forman and the choen brosteardrops of happiness  directors able to find out the hidden place where the tears of happiness sleep god bless anyone of us that can understand all the quotations of this film rob johnson the country music the roots of blues and the blues requiems i am italian and i have been a torch of feelings even without understand all the meanings of this masterpiece excellent turturro best sidekicks of blake nelson clooney absolutely amazing an humphrey bogart mixed with gable while ford is directing a lost outstanding carachter best clooney ever for me that i dont have a pussy the movie that i am gonna show to my children to make them dream in this nightmare world,black_comedy
i actually didnt watch this movie for several years after it first came out because i wasnt a george clooney fan and it just didnt sound interesting to mewhich is another lesson why not to judge by the title this movie had incredible humor fantastic acting a great plot with excellent foreshadowing youll have to watch the movie twice to appreciate this and is a fun wild ride anyone who has read homers the odyssey will also find extra humor like turning the cyclops into a one eyed bible salesman fantastic even many of my friends who dont usually like coen movies loved this filmand the sound track is out of this world,black_comedy
i saw this film years ago and afterwards i named it as my favorite film on several occasions then i forgot why now i saw it again and rememberthe plot is simple enough everett wonderfully portrayed by clooney a handsome vain man whose lines undoubtedly contain over 70 of the films vocabulary gets the two prisoners chained to him pete and delmar to join him in seeking a treasure he buried after an armored car robbery before a river is dammed and the valley in which he buried it flooded with water meanwhile they are chased by a coldblooded sheriff cooley at one point in the film subtly likened to satan and have to overcome various obstacles ranging from pete supposedly being turned into a toad to being seduced by three blatant references to the sirens of the odyssey this all becomes amusingly tangled into the electoral campaigns of the two men running for governor pappy odaniel the hotheaded old man who is striving for reelection and homer stokes who is secretly a ku klux klan leaderthere are few films that stand out to me as being perfect ones where there is nothing i can nitpick on but this is one of them it is neither too long nor too short the humour is golden the characters are endearing every scene would detract from the film if it werent there and the ending is very satisfying but not sappy wonderful film,black_comedy
fargo no o brother where art thou yes the coen brothers best picture this movie is filled with great comedy and great music the movie is based on homers the odyssey id personally would rather watch this adaptation of the book than read the book itself the movie stars as george clooney stars as ulysses everett mcgill john tuturro stars as pete and tim blake nelson as dim witted delmar odonnell all of them play escaped convicts looking for the treasure that everett had buried before going to jail so when they bust out out of jail it is a whole new adventure waiting for them when they record a song to get some cash they end up recording a hit song everyone is looking for these new found musicians but they are trying to hide from the law this whole movie is filled with hilarious one liners from clooney the move also stars holly hunter charles durning and john goodman as a greedy bible salesman this movie is a success in in every aspect and it is the coen brothers greatest film,black_comedy
to me this is what the coen brothers means not fargo which is a bit more subtle but this wonderful parody of one of the most highly regarded historic writings to take a legendary story and put it in a john turturro format is not seen nearly enough clooney does comedy well especially when eating corn whilst delmar is beating repeatedly script setting story parody blasphemy ku klux klan this is coen brothers even better than barton fink barton fink and then there is the song man of constant sorrow made me get the entire soundtrack now its not even my favourite song all those chanted songs are surprisingly awesome coens picked well and the first thing you say to someone after they have been arrested and you meet up in a cinema so must whisper should always be we thought you was a toad wonderful surreal funny pretends to be full of messages when its just coens taking the mick,black_comedy
whether you like the coen brothers or not there can be no debating that they make extremely interesting movies that arent by the book theres no question that o brother doesnt deviate from that formula the film has many scenes that dont make a whole lot of sense to me but i suppose if youve read the odyssey i have and actually remember it i dont then you might comprehend it completely the cast is solid especially clooney and turturro however dont listen to clooney when he tries to tell you he did his own singing because he didnt and its obvious because if that was him singing hed have had a few albums released the films strongest asset is its soundtrack and i challenge anyone who views it to just try and not have i am a man of constant sorrow stuck in your head for days afterwards all in all o brother is a lot of fun enjoy,black_comedy
like the rhapsodes who stitched together tales to form the odyssey the coen brothers have brought together homer blues and bluegrass george clooney and digital photography to create a modernday epiccomedy the first 12 minutes feature the memorable opening scene which i understand uses the soundtrack from a real chain gang the highly amusing song big rock candy mountain and the train scene which makes me laugh out loud every time i see it in fact this is all i saw the first time in the theater due to a power outage my husband and i received a voucher and couldnt wait to see the entire movie the next day  based on only the first twelve minutes i saw the movie in louisiana and you are my sunshine was written by our former governor jimmy davis i got a lump in my throat when the entire audience began singing you are my sunshine o brother is based on homers odyssey and its a fun parlor game to see how many episodes from the odyssey you can recognize john goodman playing the cyclops is the most obvious the one thing missing they need a voodoo priestess to play the role of circe to try and change the frog back into pete one word of warning not a spoiler there are two instances of animal brutality that are hard to watch but its obvious whats going to happenthe dvd is a musthave it shows how they took the verdant mississippi countryside and digitally enhanced it to make it look like the dustbowl of the 1930sfilm buffs will recognize tributes to cool hand luke and the wizard of oz among others the coen brothers are geniusesnow youll excuse me ive got to runnoft,black_comedy
a friend loaned me his copy of o brother and after seeing it over and over i went out and bought the dvd and video i am no spring chicken and view most modern films with with old fashioned cynicism but this film was an absolute treat the casting was superb down to the old lady in the bank who whispered thats babyface nelson and the look on her face when she took a verbal pasting from george pricelessthe music i was familiar with being old enough to have heard jimmy rogers recordings all of the music fitted in perfectlyi have passed this film on to some old friends and they have had me purchase copies on the webten out of ten well done the coen brothers and everyone associated with this great film,black_comedy
i liked o brother where art thou although ive never been a fan of the coen brothers it is a funny idea to transpose the odyssey by homre in america during the great depression in the thirties this movie is a rather successful parody of homres story here for instance the three women by the stream replaced the mermaids and penny george clooneys former wife is a derivative of penelope moreover john goodman took the role of the cyclops the coen brothers also obviously aimed at parodying several episodes of the bible notably in the last sequence with the floodi also thought that the personality of the three main actors was very similar to candide the famous character created by the french writer voltaire in the eighteenth century they go through all kinds of adventure either funny either dramatic in which they dont learn their lessonsif the humor isnt always well used in a relevant way or sometimes in a clumsy way a few sequences are particularly successful the kukluxklan one the music is also judiciously chosen and lends itself perfectly to the setting of the era its the same thing for the costumesan original movie in which the directors dont think twice before laughing at their trio of actors theyre laughing at their credulity,black_comedy
any semiintelligent person should be reasonably amused with any production by the coen brothers since incredible care is placed into mocking the specific characteristics of common ordinary people another success which like other coen brothers films has a number of messages for the viewer in the course of a film that has several oddly connected and hilarious scenesthe dialogue is witty and in this film a good amount of bluegrass music is interspersed with the theatrelike dialogue initially it takes a little getting used to in sliding into the concocted dialogue but what really takes the cake in this film are the incredible performances by all the actors who each have their moment to shineclooney is remarkably good as ulysses the leader of the pack of convicts who escape a chain gang and wander into the wild crazy and mad world of the early 20th century they come face to face with a number of characters that are included not only for the comedy but much for the messages that the characters seem to give to the audience through their dialogue what is wonderful is that the audience if semiintelligent gets to put together the pieces of the moral vignette rather than having it spoonfed in typical hollywood stylethe running hair joke in this film is hilarious even more remarkable is the great performance by comedic tim blake nelson a relative unknown turturro goodman hunter and durning are all special as well but weve come to expect excellence from that group some may not care for the coen brothers style but that is most unfortunate since you would be missing out on a collection of the worlds greatest noncommercial films ever made in the face of pretentious hollywood this one is a winner and very entertaining,black_comedy
i did not expect too much of this movie but its often these movies that give you a really good time watching them  so did o brother where art thouok i have to admit you can hardly consider this film a big one as the jokes are often on a really low level but thats just the kind of humour the coen bros intended to use and it makes the movie as for me really really enjoyablewell that homer and odysseusthing in the marketing seems way too emphasized to me as i could only find some parallels to homers ancient poems that you could find with a little effort in dozens of todays films the sirenscene even seems to be taken into the movie only to justify the use of this big poets name as it does not really fit the rest of the story but well i didnt except to watch a literature adaption but an entertaining funny movie and thats what i got  and much better than i expectedthe concept is not a new one clooney as the educated rascal with the heart in the right place and tons of rustical sayings that relativate his educated impression but it is put into practice in an ironic sometimes naive but always sympathic way  and thats what you watch movies for the impression that they leave not a consistent story or a moral realization which this movie does not claim to transportafter all you are left with a movie that is just fun watching not only for the jokes but also for the beautiful pictures and the bizarre characters its hard for me to tell what this film told me but i liked the way i was told it why arent there more of these films,black_comedy
gotta tell you i fell in love with this film this was not love at first sight this is a film you can have a relationship with and within that relationship youd find it endearing loving and without expecting it youd fall in love with it i am a cohen brothers film fan and almost all of their films had the same effect on me ya cant immediately fall in love with their films they take time to enjoy and find out how loving they can bespoilers this film is loosely based on homers the odyssey and not homer simpson either folks once you know that basic story you begin to find out just how endearing this film really is three excons were conned into breaking out of jail and go on quite an adventure believable hmmmm maybe unbelievable hmmmm maybe the key line of this film is told right in the beginning by the old man riding the rail when he tells them that they are seeking a treasure that they will get it but it will not be the one they seek but that is just what makes this fun the music is to die for and to be honest you dont have to like bluegrass it has that plus other styles as well that adds to the richness of the adventure george clooney whom i dont usually like turns in a good performance here as well as his partners in crime the one liners in this film are fun and the actors carry them off well such as the one i used to summarize the film quirky silly funny strange can all be used to sum this film upone problem i had was that i felt the ending of the film wasnt that great you could have actually ended the film 15 minutes earlier and it would have been just as fine its worth a lookor two believe you me youll find that over a few viewings youll see it for what it is a very craftyly done adaptation of an age old story like me you may just grow to like it and hold it dear,black_comedy
the first time i saw this movie i remember thinking    huh  it was funny clever but i didnt get it  i have now seen it probably five times and must say that i like it more each time i see it  the dialogue is so quick and so funny that you dont get it the first time through  on reviewing it is hilarious  i find myself quoting george clooneys lines now  well isnt this place a geographical oddity two weeks from everywhere  this movie is brilliant  it is amazingly well written and the acting is fabulous  cant wait to see it again,black_comedy
i guess ill be different and say that i dont usually like coen brothers movies but i liked this one  maybe its the amount of hype a movie receives both pre and postrelease that influences me  this was a kind of wordofmouth sleeper most of which i find delightful  fargo on the other hand is continually held out as one of the great classics of all time but i found it absolutely pointless and unfunny  both movies seem to rely on quirky characters yet the quirkiness works well in this one  you care what happens to these yutzes  the various story lines gel at the end and you realize youve seen an adventure with all the classic elements of great storytelling  a beginning a middle and an end that justifies it all  the music is appropriately oldtimey and darn good did someone here complain that it had no mainstream appeal  did you want the gravediggers to break out into a hiphop number or something just one other thingdid anyone notice the similarity between george clooneys ulysses and john ratzenbergers cliff claven,black_comedy
as i write this there are 580 different reviews about o brother where art thou most of them seem to be positive even though i feel i must make my voice clear on how i feel about this movie i figure youve already made up your mind on whether youre going to watch this movie or notlet me say watch this moviei guess i shouldve started this review by telling you that i was a bandwagon jumper when it came to this movie ive never been a george clooney fan and i dont think i could ever forgive him for what he did to the batman franchise val kilmer also so when this movie hit theaters i avoided it like the plagueeven after all of my friends told me that i had to see this movie i blew it off by telling them that i had a hair appointmenteven though my head is totally shaved the more they raved about it the more i didnt want to see itfinally after i rented almost every other movie at blockwood video i had the choice in renting chairman of the board starring carrot top or o brother where art thou even clooney beats carrot topi got home and popped some popcorn poured myself a tall cold glass of dr pepper and prepared to be let down from an overhyped movieafter the first fifteen minutes or so i realized that it didnt really suck after the first half hour i found myself laughing out loud after the credits were rolling i found myself running to the store to purchase a copyyes the music was a big selling point for me but george clooney was extremely good even oscar good in my opinion needless to say i tell everyone how great this movie is and how much i love george clooneyi still dont forgive him for batman thoughi hate people like me bandwagon jumpers,black_comedy
one of my favorite movies it has a story like none other from the very beginning of the movie it catches your attention and never lets go the movie does not have any slow periods where nothing seems to happen the movie twists and turns and introduces small stories within the story you will never be able to guess what happens next unless you already have seen the movie the characters all have their own well defined personality and seems very vivid in the hands of the talented actors many of the characters has small lines you remember long after you have seen the movie such as im a dapper dan man care for some gopher damn were in a tight spot and she runoftthe movie is not a musical but it is song rich throughout the movie songs appear many sung by the main actors and done so very well personally i think it boosts the movie making it more fun to watch the movie is a modern version of homers odyssey and in many scenes  you will recognize things from homers book i will not mention what you will have to find them yourselfall im really trying to say is watch this movie because there are none other like it and it is excellent,black_comedy
alright folks heres your riddle of the day whaddaya get if you cross the three stooges with the greek poet homero brother where art thou thats whathere is another superb comedy finely crafted by screenwriters producers directors joel and ethan coen starring george clooney tim blake nelson and john turturro it features a brilliantly written script superb acting by a wonderful ensemble cast and a musical score thats simply second to none a simple story really set in the mississippi delta region during the great depression its the tale of three petty criminals who escape from the chain gang in quest of buried treasure and experience a series of misadventures along the way ulysses everett mcgill clooney is the silvertongued selfappointed leader of this odd trio a man who claims to have stolen and buried over a million dollars in cash delmar odonnell is the docile sweettempered dimwit played to perfection by tim blake nelson the third member of our little gang is an irritable acerbic fella named pete together they set off chained to each other in search of mcgills treasure which is buried somewhere about to become a manmade lake our heroes have only four days to find the loot before its lost forever at the bottom of the newly created reservoiras they begin their journey the run across an old blind seer who prophesies that they will find a fortune but not the one they seek with a posse of law enforcement officers and vigilantes hot on their heels everett pete and delmar ditch their chains and prison garb and continue on their questour trios journey is anything but quiet and uneventful they continually run into strange people and situations at one point soon after stealing a car and picking up a guitarplaying hitchhiker they stop at a local radio station and posing as an oldtimey music group called the soggy bottom boys they cut a record thats soon all the rage throughout the region later they encounter a baptist congregation at rivers edge singing a beautiful song lulling our heroes into sweet forgetfulness for a few brief moments they happen upon three washerwomen also at rivers edge whose sirenlike song ensnares our three miscreants george nelson a bank robber on the run who nearly coopts our heroes into a real life of crime the oneeyed fasttalking bible salesman dan teague played by john goodman who offers everett pete and delmar a hard lesson on economics and life in general in the depressionravaged deep south and other characters as well governor pappy pass the biscuits odaniel running for reelection against a reformminded candidate named homer stokes everetts exwife penny soon to me remarried to a real drone named vernon waldrip and a whole gang of fellas dressed in white sheets and hoods who take exception to our heroes intrusion into their ceremoniesone of o brother where art thous greatest strengths is its musical score as the coen brothers point out nary a scene goes by without some kind of music in the background the songs  19 of them by my count  are all wonderful its a sublime mixture of oldtime gospel and country music and africanamerican spirituals from james carter and the prisoners po lazarus through alison krauses sweetly simple and reverent down to the river to pray with brilliant harmonies added by the first baptist choir of white house tennessee the oldtime country classics i am a man of constant sorrow and hard rock candy mountain and you are my sunshine to the oldtime gospel classics keep on the sunny side ill fly away and i am weary let me rest and many other songs as well the music adds an extra dimension to this already multifaceted film by the way all these songs can be found on the o brother where art thou soundtrack compact disc but thats another reviewive now watched o brother where art thou about a dozen times each viewing has been a genuine pleasure for me this film is clever in its conception extraordinary in its execution sublime in its storytelling and masterful in its music in short wonderfully entertaining in every respect a definite mustsee for movielovers everywhere,black_comedy
spoilers right from the beginning i knew i would love this movie  i was right it was not exactly artistic but it sure did have some of its components  the symbolism in the movie was so beautiful first the filtered colours added a nice oldfashioned southern effect when i was watching the movie i really tried to find any deep greens blues and reds but i really couldnt find anythey were all drained of their colour  adding all these images like butterflies around delmar sirens incorporating all these characters of homers odyssey in such a creative yet more realistic manner made the movie quite charming ummacting was quite good george clooney did sound like a boisterous knowitall and i think it comes naturally to him all in all i love this movie the music was classic 8510,black_comedy
i have yet to see a coen brothers movie i didnt like but i can see how some of their work can be a little too esoteric for some eg the wonderfully strange barton fink o brother where art thou however is their most accessible and downright entertaining movie to date and should appeal to a wide range of viewers a typically eccentric coen premise  homer retold as a depression musical comedy  it manages to be consistently funny and warm without losing any of their trademark quirks and wit george clooney steals the show with one of his  best performances equal to three kings in my opinion and is wonderfully backed up by coen regular john turturro do the right thing and relative new comer tim blake nelson the three make a classic comedy team ala the three stooges the rest of the first rate supporting cast includes many familiar faces from previous coen films john goodman holly hunter etc as well as the underrated daniel von bargen lord of illusions desert blue and wild at heart weirdo frank collison this movie is a joy from start to finish i loved it and would recommend it to anybody who is looking for a genuinely funny and clever comedy,black_comedy
this movie has it all all but the gratuitous sex violence and foul language that seen to be the predominant theme of contemporary adult films i have known people like the three convicts central to this story this makes the story somewhat plausible the music is wonderful the story is funny casting was superb and the photography in almost sepia draws the viewer into the era i loved the movie watched it twice and will watch it again,black_comedy
absurd loose adaptation  if you really can say this  of homeros odyssey three wacko convicts clooney turturro and nelson escape from the prison and start together a strange full of surprise voyage across the country just to prevent the new marriage of clooneys wife hunter in this sometimes weird and uneasy trip they find a saucy governor durning a thief goodman and even baby face nelson the famous gangster joel e ethan coen try to built an ironic portrait of american society mainly the communities of mississipi and kentucky in the thirties but fails in this attempt the movie is unfunny even boring sometimes  and without any real spice touches i give this a 5 five,black_comedy
everett mcgill george clooney delmar tim blake nelson and pete john tuturro have just escaped from prison in 1930 mississippi they find out about a hidden treasure which puts them on a quest through the south to go and find it they end up doing whatever it takes that means singing live bluegrass hitchiking jumping on and off trains and meeting women with strange powers encountering the ku klux klan plus morethis film is one of the funniest most hilarious comedies i have seen in a very long time most kids my age which is 15 probably dont appreciate this movie as much as i did but all is well i thought that george clooney gave the performance of a lifetime in o brother where art thou same goes for john tuturro and tim blake nelsongeorge clooney oceans eleven one fine day john tuturro barton fink tim blake nelson holly hunter the piano john goodman barton fink charles durning the muppet moviewritten and directed by the joel  ethan cohen fargo the man who wasnt there barton fink real master filmmaking and writing a movie for ages 12 and up,black_comedy
i was truly and wonderfully surprised at o brother where art thou the video store was out of all the movies i was planning on renting so then i came across this i came home and as i watched i became engrossed and found myself laughing out loud the coens have made a magnificiant film again but i think the first time you watch this movie you get to know the characters the second time now that you know them you laugh sooo hard it could hurt you i strongly would reccomend anyone seeing this because if you are not you are truly missing a film gem for the ages 1010,black_comedy
they loved him up and turned him into a horny toad  god that gets to me every timethis is a great movie  memorable lines from thank god your momma died given birth sheda seen ya sheda died of shame to i dont understand big dan  great scenes from the opening train scene laughed so hard i cried to the bluegrasswatch it  its good its great its funny and its based on a famous story  worth your while believe me  dont watch this if you have a weak bladder for you will definitely wet your pants laughing,black_comedy
when the trailer for o brother where art thou first came out i remember watching it and thinking that the movie looked like it was supposed to be quirky and funny but the quirky and funny parts had been left out of the preview  i felt pretty much the same way once i saw the actual film clooney is fun to watch and the bits about his hair cream made me chuckle a few times but im sorry i need more than hair cream jokes  it was one of those movies where a lot transpires on the screen but nothing really happens,black_comedy
edit august 2016 i just watched it again after 15 years and it is still a comedic masterpiece those coen brothers sure know how to entertainspoilersloosely based on homers odyssey where ulysses attempts to return home to his wife penelope and his children after the trojan war encountering the cyclops the sirens and other obstacles finding tormentors who believed him dead and wanting to marry his wifein o brother where art thou george clooney plays ulysses holly hunter plays penelope penny john goodman plays the cyclops patch over his eye and three beautiful women washing clothes in the creek play the singing sirens allinall a very welldone film definitely a comedy and interesting the way the coens used the odyssey as inspiration even crediting homer as a cowriterthe film opens in almost black and white slowly gradually showing color first with a light blue sky the dvd extra showing the filming technique i found highly interesting to achieve the look all film was scanned and digitized so that images could be properly manipulated most of the greens of grass and trees for example where made to look almost golden the colors were desaturated to give a light pastel rendering but with normal contrast then all digital images were transferred to film and copies made for theatrical showingsspoilers  instead of the trojan war ulysses and his men pete and delmer have just escaped from a depressionera rockbreaking chain gang in mississippi although he was imprisoned for practicing law without a license he tells the other two men he stole and hid 12million and when they retrieved it they would split it 3 ways later he tells them if i had told you the truth you wouldnt have come with me and they were all chained togetherthey get a ride with babyface my name is george nelson and are beneficiaries of a bank robbery they sing into the can for money as the foggy bottom boys and later it comes in handy as they get a pardon from the governor during a picnic goodman a giant with a patch over one eye cyclops steals their money they foil a kkk lynchingulysses finally makes his way back to his ancestral home finds sheriff cooley von bargen and his men digging 3 graves nooses over the branch when suddenly a great flood sweeps over them all hydroelectric power they save themselves holding onto a floating coffin drives out his wifes tormentors politician and the films again fades to black and white as penny and ulysses talk about getting remarried she had divorced him telling the children he had been hit by a train some very important people have been hit by trainsthe dvd is really a superb visual treat probably being made directly from the digitized images the surround sound is selectable in either dts or dd 51 i watched it with dts and the sound is great as i mentioned above the extras are a fine addition many people will not like this movie my wife only gave it 30 minuteson a personal note it is nice to see daniel von bargen cooley fit and trim since he had gotten a bit heavy in recent years our history goes back to 1969 where he and i were on stage with a bunch of others at purdue for the 28performance run of the student production of leave it to jane,black_comedy
just seen this film at an nft preview and i was blown away by it it is very funny gorgeous to look at has a stunning soundtrack and absolutely impeccable comedy performances sharing a similar meandering storyline with the big lebowski it succeed where that film fails by still having a coherent storyline running through and a satisfying resolution as ive come to expect from the coens the visuals are striking but theyve never been this beautiful before and at no time  unlike  in previous films do they seem merely to be there as an exercise in cleverness but what makes this film is the excellent comic performances from even the smaller roles several of whom are coen regulars  even though the characters as in many coen films are slightly irregular stereotypes the performances give even the shallow characters a depth and makes the scenes even more funny oh and the soundtrack aint too bad either,black_comedy
i remember seeing the preview to this and thought this looks like the stupidest movie ive ever seen my roommate rented it one night and i saw it on directv ready to be rewatched when he replied i told him dude are you crazy this is the dumbest movie ive ever seen he said dude you have to watch this this is the funniest movie you have ever seen looking back i cannot deny that comment not only is it one of the funniest movies ive ever seen but it gets better every time i watch it my favorite parts are the part with him commenting on his hair all the time hows my hair  my hair  i dont want fop god damnit im a dapper dan man this movie is a hidden gem,black_comedy
o brother where art thou movie reviewby brooke dupreedirectorsjoel coen ethan coen uncreditedwritershomer epic poem the odyssey ethan coenstarsgeorge clooney john turturro tim blake nelson john goodman holly hunteranyone who has read homers odyssey knows that odysseuss journey is wracked with obstacles odysseuss internal battle with his ego and his desire to go home to his family is the inspiration for the coen brothers successful portrayal of the journey of ulysses everett mcgill george clooney and his two fellow escaped convicts in o brother where art thou 2000everetts obsession with his hair and his knowitall tendencies lead he and his two dimwitted jail mates pete john torturro and delmar tim blake nelson as they search for a secret treasure through the deep south during the great depression just like in the odyssey they come across their fair share of hurdles the ultimate of which being the lawman hot on their trail which leads the audience through their ridiculous pitfalls narrowly escaping the law accompanying bank robbers and losing one of their friends to the sirensthere are two ways one could view this film and be either disappointed or delighted if the audience is expecting to follow a more modern story that closely relates to the odyssey she will be disappointed since the film is very loosely based on homers classic poem however if the expectation is to just find a story about three escaped convicts searching for treasure then she will see some of the connections to the odyssey but appreciate the turn of events as its own story somewhat from the odysseys characters and plot line the obvious liberty that the coen brothers took with depicting homers odyssey does not veer completely off base instead they offer the basic nuts and bolts of some of its most epic characters and scenes cyclops makes an appearance as a smoothtalking bible salesman played by john goodman and the siren scene is sexy and mesmerizing as it should be since the coen brothers left some of the most ultimate parts of the odyssey in the film we are able to make the connection but view each scene as its own separate contribution to the journey of everett himselfsome of the most important characters from homers poem are missing however one of them especially the character of telemachus although we dont necessarily need his character to tell the whole story his absence is felt by the necessary plot moving specifically towards odysseuss journey which is in part to get home to his son and wife and helps to portray the time lost in odysseuss absence without his presence in the movie the audience may lose this detrimental part to the story we are also missing the overall stakes throughout the film the connection between everett and his ultimate goal is lost this could be because the focus on the possibility of losing his wife and daughters to another man the suitors is not very well established as the most important motive for everetts escape from prison the way southerners are portrayed is also a bit problematic in my opinion some of the characters are seen as being redneck hicks dumb and foolish although this portrayal is mostly done as a backwards humor i think it is a misportrayal since the coen brothers have admitted per other film critiques that they have never even been to mississippi that being said i find it a little jarring that the south is chosen as a background to represent the foolishness and stupidity of some of the odysseys most famous players i am biased however as i have lived in the south my entire lifei think o brother where art thou was an attempt by the coen brothers to remain true to the story of odysseuss journey but not stick to it as a form of storytelling i believe it is successful as its own story not as it relates to the odyssey but as it stands alone by itself in other words the characters and the scenes can be considered something completely different than the odyssey as more of a journey to get the girl and find religion since from the beginning everett argues with his cohorts about religious validity and speaking of religion the film seems to be using religion or everetts question of it as a way to question the difference between right and wrong and the basic human struggle to stay on the right path resist temptation as everett continues his quest to get home he begins to suffer and asks god for mercyi would compare this movie to a road trip film such as smokey and the bandit a rendition of which is complete with southern sass and culture bluegrass and country singing and travelers who are constantly evading the law without a heavy influence on the ultimate objective of the journey itself o brother where art thou may not be lacking in humor and good ole southern religion but its attempt to stay true to the original odyssey is in effect not going to make it home,black_comedy
i have watched this over and over its a classic,black_comedy
over the years i keep coming back to this movie and i thoroughly enjoy watching it every time the soundtrack is amazing and fun especially if youre a lover of bluegrass and the cast is hilarious in this touching and comedic take of homers odyssey its an entertaining family movie thats great for any occasion fun to watch and sing along to one of my all time favorite coen brothers movies,black_comedy
the coen brothers created a superb adventure comedy about three well written convicts played by there great actors george clooney john turturro and tim blake nelson their chemistry and acting made the characters feel alive the hair pomade great running gagthe side characters were also funny and well written george nelson being my favoritecomedy was clever written made me laugh and it felt natural and not forcedthe cinematography and the soundtrack was the other two main things that made this a perfect movie im a fan of the genre so i loved it but for everyone else i believe they will feel the same critics didive to say this was so much better the second time i watched it back in 5th grade i sure didnt know much about movies back then superb movie,black_comedy
there is nothing i dont love about this film beautiful atmosphere and cinematography script actors music its all top notch watched this again last night for probably the 20th time and i still find so much to love everetts flowery delivery cracks me up afresh every viewing im a huge coen brothers fan so it was fated to be up there with fargo and the big lebowski but this really is top of the heap,black_comedy
a wonderful cast and i admit that even i didnt get all of the characters but i will try so here goes the renegade sheriff is the devil john goodman is the cyclops charles dunning is zeus the 3 amorous ladies by the water are the sirens george clooney is ulysses and holly hunter is his wife the blind man is the soothsayer i am not sure what character babyface nelson represents but he is plumcrazy surprisingly little if any cussing and muted violence even in the kkk crossburning scene suprisingly complex dialog for george the governor and john goodmans characters based on the actual political career and campaign by a southern governor seeking reelection during the great depression the coen brothers masterpiece i believe so authentic and honest hillbilly period music violent but rather tongueincheek like the butch cassidy movie it may be a bit slow for some impatient viewers enjoy the wonderful musical program a critical and financial success,black_comedy
the first time i saw this film was in a cinema and one of the very few times ive spontaneously stood up and applauded at the endid call this the ultimate road movie about the birth of rocknroll popular culture and modern celebrity all done in a most agreeable way by those masters of cinema  the coen brothersvery funny very musical though in no way a musical and my favourite film of all time,black_comedy
i sometimes like these directorss movies and sometimes i dont  george clooney is on fire here  aptly supported by the cast and the scores are fantastic fully hilarious ,black_comedy
this is a coen brothers product i am talking fargo true grit no country for old men and the list goes like that this two is two of the best in the market they put their signature in this movie to well written the story is really good along their journey lots of weird things happening bad luck and good luck the acting is also really good well despite all of this good sides movie doesnt brings any emotions at least for me even though whit the good acting and good music you will enjoy the film,black_comedy
the coen brothers just a rush of pure originality musical genius and inspired storytelling situated outside the box of used conventions and rooted deeply in a whimsical realm of absurd charming characters on an epic odyssey across the american south during arguably the most eccentric time period the 1930s great depression its the coens second best for me its hard to top the lebowski dude and a film that i watched so many time growing up that its almost now a piece of my soul its loosely based on homers the odyssey three bumbling convicts escape from a dusty chain gang in a delightful opening romp set to harry mcclintocks the big rock candy mountain ulysses everett mcgill george clooney is their silver tongued trouble making leader on his way to reunite with his estranged wife holly hunter reliably stubborn and sassy and little daughters along with him is short tempered pete coen regular john turturro in top form and sweet dimwitted delmar tim blake nelson together they get in just about every kind of trouble that you can imagine three hapless convicts on the run in depression era south getting into they briefly share paths with musician tommy chris thomas king cross the radar of a boisterous bible salesman john goodman stealing scenes as usual with his effortless booming charm become involved with duelling governor candidates homer stokes and pappy o daniels wayne duvall and charles durning and have run ins with sexy sirens led by musetta vander the kkk notorious mobster george babyface nelson michael badalucco has to be seen to be believed as the lively likely bi polar suffering wise guy and more all the while pursued by mysterious sheriff cooley daniel von bargen rip its quite al lot of goings on for one film but the coens are masters of telling zany eclectic stories that deviate into all sorts of unexpected subplots without ever derailing and losing us this one flows along wondrously a wild funny and haunting fable that almost feels like a dust bowl dantes inferno at times albeit of much lighter subject matter roger deakins spins poetry with his lens capturing every chaff of wheat every ray of southern sun and brown hued set design with painstaking expertise what really holds it together though is the absolute knockout soundtrack theres so many moments of now iconic musical storytelling that we feel were watching a strange bluegrass lullaby that just happens to take place in cinematic vision the coens have always known their music but they transcend to another level of intuition here gathering an incredibly evocative group of songs and artists together that stir the collective ancestral memory of historical americana off the top of my head theres you are my sunshine keep on the sunny side ill fly away beautifully warbled by the kossoy sisters didnt leave nobody but the babe sung by the slinky sirens in the highways by the adorable peasall sisters jimmie rodgerss in the jailhouse now lonesome valley ralph stanleys two eerie pieces o death and angel band also by the peasall gals and the classic down to the river to pray which sneaks up on you and leaves you in rapture from its inescapable grip my favourite by far though is i am a man of constant sorrow an endlessly catchy hobo tune of jangling melancholy and highway humour sung by john hartford but cheekily lip synced by clooney and team an original piece made up on the fly by the three characters that goes on to make them ridiculously famous under the pseudonym the soggy bottom boys its all an intoxicating wonder to take in the period authentic screenplay and production a feast for the senses the coens seem to be adept at whatever they try sly satire period piece stinging violence dark humour and even touching drama when they put their minds to it this is a career high for them a totally unique piece of art that demands multiple viewings and a spot in any avid movie collectors pantheon,black_comedy
another thoroughly enjoyable coen offering the coens have become as an italian might put it master del loro mestiere masters of their craft in the coen adaptation of homers epic clooneys character ulysuss evert mcgee faces the same obstacles as homers hero odysseus encountered in an effort to return to his wife and children everts goal as well the cyclops the prophet the sirens captivity suitors for his wifes affections charybdis more or less all the parallels are there and are all interwoven in this compelling amusing and must see film kudos to the coens and their cast by the way the music aint bad either you wont regret spending roughly 110 minutes of your life i predict enjoying this film if you do regret the time spent then you and i are entirely different animals,black_comedy
a magical retelling of homers odyssey weaved through rural mississippi during the great depression the coens draw us into the setting with ease times of economic desperation growth of chain stores and stay out of woolsworths the rise and spread of music through radio populist politicians appealing through sweeping campaigns and folksy country western music racial tensions behind public imagetheres also the references to the greek myth that blend seamlessly with the period piece a boisterous and large man as polyphemus john goodman three haunting and mesmerising girls bathing by the river as the sirens a prophetic blind old man as tiresiasthe film blends this narrative with its setting so well at times almost dream like in its atmosphere  take the soulstirring choral rendition of down to the river to pray by a mass of baptismees as the camera gracefully unveils the progression heading to down the river and everett and delmars conversation about gophers comes to a standstill in amazement confronted with a lush green mississippi upon principal photography the coens enlisted long time collaborator roger deakins to oversee a groundbreaking digital colour correction process that saw the fields of green turned into a dry and dusty rural canvas the browns of the sepia tone seep into the frame and enhance the already dirty and ragged look of our trio of escapees mistakenly identified as coloured after days of weary grimy travel by the kkk whenever you get the chance make sure you watch the correct version with this post production process in it otherwise be treated with garishly jarring green fields in the background and of course the boys hauling the blocks of dripping ice across the fields becomes a less immersive imagegeorge clooney plays the leading man ulysses everett mcgill full of charm and suaveness twice he wakes up from his slumber to worries of his perfect hair being ruined im a dapper dan man and despite his overall easiness and wisdom he still exhibits some peculiar insecurities or emotional tangents but his best lines come from his exasperation or cheerful sardonic quips well aint this place a geographical oddity two weeks from everywhere and baptism you two are just dumber than a bag of hammers the second smartest of the three is pete hogwallop despite his name possessing heart with turturro hitting a wide range of notes including the absurd do not seek the treasure and overthetop humour im gonna kill you judas iscariot hogwallop the funniest is delmar played with such heart and good intentions by tim blake nelson always curious but naive we thought you was a toad theres a sort of gullible and lovable idiocy about delmar that can only be displayed by nelson and that big smile whether its the grand sweeping gesture as he indicates that the water is indeed fine or the sympathy he shows for the livestock delmar is the glue that holds the group together okay im with you fellas if you havent already figured out obwat is endlessly quotable theyre joined by a varied host of colourful and memorable characters like the humble tommy a black guitarist who sold his soul to the devil for his wicked talent the well rounded and grinning nelson feared through the state for his machine gun and babyface but dont say that in front of him the well endowed pappy odaniel and his escort irate but a politician through and through and the reform candidate homer stokes well mannered and good natured but possessing seedier ideals underneath hes revealed as the imperial wizard of the kkk at a nightime rally the mass choreography and the fiery chants managing to look ominous and overthetop ridiculous at the same time but what would obwat be without its immensely successful and award winning soundtrack that perfectly sets the mood for the southern depressionera tale it features a impressive cast of country bluegrass and folk musicians emmylou harris alison krauss norman blake ralph stanley and of course the jaunty and effortless voice of dan tyminski on the iconic man of constant sorrow that and many of the rustic two and three part harmonies blend so easily in the story world and with those warm accompaniments of guitar mandolins and banjos who didnt cheer when delmar and and pete launching straight into the harmonious intro in that hall its musical romp is simply infectious as the radio station manager says its some mighty fine apickin and asingin,black_comedy
a movie that you wont know whats happening unless you watch it like in the part where everett said there was no money he just didnt want to go out on his ownit was an all around good movie to watchi didnt like the part with the kkk that was just racial and it was just bad i hated thatthey got what was coming to them looking like they did in there crappy clothes waving there money around a lunch table and talking loudlywhen they met baby face nelsen it surprised me because he was a notorious bank robber in the time this movie was basedso all around this movie was good in parts and bad in others,black_comedy
homers odysseys thoughtful version of coen brothers the blind man on rail trackthe three girlsgoddess kirkedevils chasea long journey towards homeof course great comedyof course great acting by the trioand of course great songsincluding man of constant sorrow loli love clooneys care for his hairand the horse on dinner killed last tuesdayfurthermore what i personally love in good movies the great cinematographycheers the soggy bottom boys are here,black_comedy
from the opening of the film almost to the end this movie has a great feel the cinematography is beautiful and following around these three escaped convicts is interesting to watch but unfortunately these characters are only so interesting and the situations are what the movie has to rely on the situations become tiring and then the characters have to run the show it wouldve been good if both were great at all times but they just werenteverett george clooney delmar tim blake nelson and pete john turturro have just escaped from prison they go on several long adventures sing a few songs and more than anything try to avoid the police all 3 of the leading actors are very good and have an odd but great chemistry with each other tim blake nelson especially stands out acting wise as the confused convict who wants to be erased of all his sins the movie has no real plot or center which is fine but some of the subplots are dull and bring this movie down a level from where it could be overall though this is a beautiful looking interesting character piece on three good hearted convictsmy rating  out of  100 mins pg13 for violence and language,black_comedy
took me forever to finally see this movie from beginning to end but i really enjoyed it when i finally did george clooney and holly hunter were great i especially like the eventual resolve to the music vs racism the cinematography is great the costumes and music really fit what you would expect from the perioddespite the forementioned mishaps of historical inaccuracies and goofs the film is definitely worth a lookeven if you havent read or seen any of the booksfilms this one was created aroundi personally think that this is one of george clooneys best performances though he is not as sexy in this as he is in other films also keep your eye open for other stars that you might recognize from other films especially by the same maker,black_comedy
this oscarnominated film is my favorite coenbrothers film after fargo george clooney is just hilarious as the leader of misfit escapeesi had to put off cutting my grass just to see it again yes i am still cutting grass the last week of novemberthe cinematography and music in this film is a delight in itself but the characters are just a thrill to watchjohn goodman a coen brothers favorite holly hunter as the wife charles durning as the governor and his crazy crew and of course mia tyler musetta vander and christy taylor as the sirensbaby face nelson the kkk and mississippi politics all rolled into a fun movie,black_comedy
i must say at the outset that i am a total coen brothers fan and have seen all of their projects this ranks right up there as one of their crowning achievementsthis is a retelling of the odyssey by homer and after viewing this i finally got a handle on just what the odyssey was about in a nutshell it follows the exploits of a man and the exotic characters he meets along his journey the way the coen brothers personified such stalwart literary characters as the cyclops john goodman and the furies is most creativeexcellent performances all around from the likes of george clooney in one of his most endearing roles the incomparable john goodman holly hunter john turturo charles durning and a wonderfully strong supporting casthowever one cannot mention the merits of this movie without a mention of the soundtrack it is most obvious that the coen brothers invested an enormous amount of research to make sure that the music adequately accompanied the mood and tone a wonderfully indelible example is the use of an acapella song that utilizes no words only moans still used in africanamerican churches that is beautifully realizedthe music in this project is positively spellbinding regardless of your particular musical preferences  there is something here for everybody the soundtrack deserved the kudos it receivedthis one you will enjoy over and over and over again eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeexcellent,black_comedy
i first heard about oh brother where art thou from a friend about a year ago she fondly remembered the movie and declared it as one of her favourites  after that i was itching to see it i finally got to watch it a couple of night ago and i was far from disappointedoh brother where art thou is a beautiful movie starring three escaped convicts hunting for treasure it is a story of friendship and adventure i watched it with my family ages ranging from 8  40  it kept us all engaged which is very difficult in a family where we all have different tastes with a beautiful soundtrack picturesque locations and above all brilliant acting this film really is a must see9 out of 10,black_comedy
ok i completely love the coen brothers they can do no wrong they are the scoundrel analysts of the human soul the world is not to be taken too seriously and they know it and they can persuade actors to be as great as they can be but they dont make funny haha movies you will cry as much as you laugh from the deep empathy they show to every creation and all of this this happens in oh brother george clooney who already has that glint in his eye that a leading man needs is now granted humility and desperation which his jail suit complements perfectly are there not at least ten characters in this movie you will never forget people you will see on the streets from now onwards but you never knew they existed before these geniuses pointed them out to you hail coen brothers,black_comedy
i am a surviving member of a family who remembers these characters breezing through our little town back in 31 we hung those boys but i guess this is a good hollyweird take on that situation love george clooney he reminded us of a gable or a flynn type both had relations with our girls we disowned all here is my niece ethel and her storywe lived through the depression and related to some of the conditions portrayed we have watched it perhaps a dozen times each time we see it we pick up on something we had missed because we were still laughing at or discussing an earlier scene or line the entire film was a collection of photographically great faces we are still asking ourselves whether the entire cast were professionals or whether some were individuals found on location the film was rich with subtle tieins like the children tied together with twine as the prisoners were connected by chains we still think the cow may have been hit unintentionally fords of that era had mechanical brakes the driver of the car may not have been accustomed the longer stopping distances required the many allusions to ulysses odyssey inspired us to do an internet search we found a modern text version and discovered more sly references we appreciate blue grass and country music as originally american and found it thoroughly enjoyable along with the authentic go to sleep little baby and down from the mountain we were emotionally touched by this film because of our age and find it totally entertaining every time we view it we are still amazed that someone not of our generation could have captured the essence of that period of united states historymy niece is mentally unstable and you should not take her seriously these characters really existed and some still live they are still interested in larceny etc so you should beware we remember the baptismals in the river ceremonies get baptized the only way to the kingdom of heaven,black_comedy
not exactly sure whether id like it there was nothing else on tv which took my interest so i decided to give this film a few minutes of my timeits one of those curious films where there is no easily identifiable plot but it is a series of events which came across as being well stitched together congratulations to the film makers for doing a great job of thatits a comedy and a good one at that it does take a little while to get into assuming it is a film that you can personally get into it might not suit everyone but once youve got the theme sorted out you really start to chuckle at the events that take placei was glad i sat down to watch this one and i can see me watching it again in due course,black_comedy
those coen brothers movies really do grown on you i had just seen fargo when i rented this it is one of the most creative off the wall films i have ever seen as these characters bumble their ways after a prison break they are embraced by a series of the most unconventional personages ever to hit filmdom and one gets turned into a frogsort of their flirtations with fame the klan a cyclops and all the other episodes make this a hilarious romp george clooneys ulysses is an obsessive full speed ahead damn the torpedoes coupled with the charming halfwittedness of his fellow travelers works at every level like greek poetry he is butting heads with the gods but despite setbacks keeps moving it is story telling with charm and a load of bull everyone is some kind of philosopher but the words come out of gap toothed shaved headed hillbillies and of course clooney has hell to pay i could watch this over and over again and then theres the really cool music i didnt even mention that,black_comedy
this is absolutely one of the most fun and entertaining films i have ever seen easily ranking up there with the adventures of baron munchausensomewhat like terry gilliam and his cohorts the coen brothers have a knack for creating a wacky story with colorful oddball characters and odd events in a surreal manner that is utterly compelling and convincing they achieved all of that in this film providing a surreal and very fun take on a stereotypical movieland version of the south combined with many ideas and characters certainly based on the odyssey and aeneid although they supposedly claimed never to have read the odyssey and some have criticized this film as incorrectly claiming to be inspired by the odyssey it is quite clear that that inspiration is there numerous characters and events are clearly taken from the myths of odysseus and in fact aeneas but they are simply dressed up in a wacky southern guise the events may not happen exactly as they did in the odyssey etc but that is irrelevant the fact remains that the parallels are undeniably there and that everything in the film works beautifully the cinematography visuals in general soundtrack and the acting are all excellent the result is in my book certainly one of the coen brothers best achievements although not quite the equal of the hudsucker proxy which is simply incredible it is possibly their most fun move ever,black_comedy
this movie really had it all  meaning humor great acting wonderful writing i was very impressed with the quality of the direction and the screenplay both of which brought out a uniquely adapted odyssey the films cinematography captures the essence of the 30s and contrary to its slapstick front makes some very important points about us history social circles and cultural heritage one of the 15 movies i own simply because of how effective i found it watching it reminds me of the first time i saw gladiator and the way i questioned my worldview seeing deeper meaning to the mundane things around me in gladiator the mundane was represented by the feel of wheat shafts on ones palm vividly represented in russell crowes dreams of his home in this film the simple landscape that forms each scene brings to mind how important it is to just stop and appreciate the little things,black_comedy
when this movie came out i read an article that said that the plot was based on the odyssey by homer  they were probably right it is like the hick version of the timeless classic  in a couple years when material is short theyll probably do the same for the illiad  but seriously folks just because its hick doesnt mean it isnt great  the characters are funny the situations are funny especially when they knock the burning cross on the kkk membersthe music is pretty good too  when it came out i really liked that i am a man of constant sorrow song  it you want a funny definitely a time piece and something from the south then this is perfect,black_comedy
this chain gang classic film brought back memories from the past  i remember traveling in the south and seeing these men in chains along the side of the road and thought what a horrible punishment in the hot steamy sun and the great physical pain the men had to endure george clooneyulysses everett mcgill along with john turturropete gave excellent drama and comedy with their great acting skills  however john goodmanbig dan teague with a oneeyed patch and a suppose to be bible salesman gave some good punches to ulysses over a picnic lunch   charles durning gov pappy shook his big round bottom along with ulysses to all the western tunes and even cut a top hit country western song   this is a must see classic film which will keep you guessing throughout the entire film,black_comedy
what makes this movie is the characters yes oddly enough thats grammatically correct look it up the coen bros can always be depended upon to deliver memorable personalities even for characters with less than a minute of screen timeclooney was the only real problem for me his perfect hollywood face dirty as it was still seemed outofplace among the real people cast he delivered a much better performance than i was expecting of him though he just stuck out from the rest of the actors maybe that was the point in casting him i dont knowdoesnt hurt that i also loved the music no thats not grammatically correct i know most quotable dialogue ive seen in a movie for a long long timegreat choice for the dvd collection,black_comedy
blind oracle sirens a cyclops an all powerful hateful pursuer and a long journey fraught with danger  yep thats the odyssey  i read it hard to read hard to stick with  o brother wasnt ill bet homer wished he had had thought to seed it with old timey music and a sense of humor i really liked this movie,black_comedy

i have nothing bad to say about this film at all  the acting was deadon the best performance given by clooney ever south park cameos notwithstanding  the visuals and soundtrack were entirely too much fun and 100 unique to the era that this movie was released intowhat else could we expect from the coen brothers who have been creating completely original visions since the mid1980s  the story is a wonderful spin on homers the odyssey and cribs several characters and events from the ancient tale  if there were any complaint about this film at all it would be the few liberties it takes with the poets tale but it still makes for an epic film the kind of loopiness that was missing from the newton boys remember that one or certain modern day remakes of classic storiesa 1010 on this one sheer mindless random fun but still grounded in reality exactly as homer would have dictated it,black_comedy
once again the coen brothers have a made a feelgood movie that will make you laugh and will make you jump from your seat i believed that everybody in the film did outstanding in this movie i just saw this movie yesterday at the theaters and i was really impressed by it when i when to the theater for o brother where art thou people saw it because of george clooney and how much of a hunk he is for me i saw it because of the coen brothers there are outstanding and talented filmmakers and i cant wait to see more of their work they did a magnificent job on this movie and plus they have a really good idea of how to make people laugh the coen brothers are one of those writerdirectors that are good at it i hope this film gets some oscar nominations this is a very funny film and joel and ethan coen if youre reading this i love you guys hey cast me in one of your movies,black_comedy
if laughters good for the soul ive had a spiritual cleansing just watching this movie  then again if laughters also the best medicine then my health must be perfect after watching this coen brothers masterpiece of dark humor  how can such a depressing location with such a downcast group of individuals be funny  just have the coen brothers touch it with their unique brand of humor  my wn son my brothers and i all loved raising arizona  we laughed till our sides ached and it was without doubt the most hysterically funny movie we had all seen until o brother where art thou was made  now we have two fabulous comedies from which to choose whenever we are down in the dumps and need a guaranteed laugh a big plus in this movie was the excellent music  the sound track alone lifts the spirits  even with the soggy bottom boys big hit having such a downer title  man of constant sorrow out of a rating of 1 through 10 id give this and raising arizona an 11,black_comedy
im an action movie buff and typically dont take a hankerin to arty films i just dont have the sophistication or film school training to appreciate the cinematography or makeup or score if the plot is badbut i was really dazzled by o brother where art thou which comes with a big dose of arty but its not overwhelming rather its accessible with a fast intellectual plot lots of comedy and lots of wonderful bluegrass musicwhat a wonderfully original film and unlike many musicals where the characters just say oh i think ill break into song now there are real plot reasons for the singing to occur everywhere if you are familiar with homers the odyssey there are some injokes as well there are a number of wonderfully clever plot gimmicks too such as the endingmy only concern would be that bluegrass music is sometimes so religious its overkill but thats just the culture and the music is great i immediately went out to rent some other coen brothers films and with the exception of millers crossing wasnt that impressed with the otherswho should see this film everyoneill give this film a 10 out of 10,black_comedy
i was very pleasantly surprised by this film george clooney was superb showing a comic side that is usually masked behind the stereotypical hollywood leading man machismo the interestingly manipulated colours and rich and fascinating use of southern music remained with me long after the show was over,black_comedy
the coens finest effort yet combining stunning cinematography and the highest quality character acting to create an intelligently stupid film three convicts escape a chain gang in the deep south and pursue a hallowed treasure with the intention of splitting it three ways however the treasure turns out to be bogus and the three men end up discovering hidden musical talents which win them a repreive the three men go on a journey which allows the spectator to view the idiosyncracies of life through the eyes of three idiots covering everything from politics through racism to lovea dramatisation of homers odysey obrother renders a time and space with such poignancy that you feel as if you are viewing the film through the same sandy gauze as all that romantic frontier photography  you immediately fall in love with the locale and its characters each a film in themselves and strong performances by all without exception synergise an equally brilliant script,black_comedy
i loved it  the acting was superb the music was wonderful and it made me laugh  this is also one of those movies that gets funnier each time you see it   the actors who played delmar and pete were really believable  and of course george clooney was great  didnt his character remind anybody of clark gable in it happened one night,black_comedy
since i loved the big lebowski so much i felt the urge to buy this movie as well and it might not be as great as big lebowski but it sure is great the coen brothers just make excellent moviesgeorge clooney delivers a load of funny lines throughout the movie and cant seem to stay serious for 5 seconds john torturro and tim blake nelson arent quite as funny tho its basicly up to clooney and the characters they meet to keep the comedy feel up but the scene where nelson discovers the toad is just a killer on their journey to stop a marriage they encounter many strange people and lots of other stuff klu klux klan for example or george baby face nelson john goodman also plays a role here but hes not that funny compared to his role in big lebowski but its always fun seeing goodman aroundthe soundtrack as with all other coen movies is great and damn fitting to and the scenery was the best ive seen in years a great movie a must have,black_comedy
i dont follow the  same school of thought of some people when it comes to the cohen brothers that everything they do is brilliant even when its poor brilliance  they are hitandmiss just as everyone else in hollywood this is without a doubt a hit a simple story that is filmed beautifully and skillfully acted george clooney is excellent and i  have disliked him in everything he has done until now the role was tailormade for him i saw a lot of reviews knocking his southern accent  even though clooney is the only southern born soggy bottom boy delmar and petes  accents are stereotyped southern accents and not really on the money  clooneys use of a pseudoregal southern accent was on the mark and fit the character perfectly watch the movies at least twicelisten to the soundtrack endlessly,black_comedy
i viewed this film  with my brother  on a tip from a libraian friend who said this film was funny she wasnt kidding this film will make you laugh hard and also make you think about your next cd purchase the music suits this movie perfectly and will get you up out of your chair and  dance if you love interesting movies see this one,black_comedy
until the big lebowski i did not know who the coen brothers were fargo was interesting but blood is not that much of a turn on for me even if it is tongue and cheek but when i saw lebowski i thought it was the best movie i had ever seen so i had to see everything that the coens did including fargo again seeing blood simple for the first time and knowing who the coens are and what they had to go through to get into the movie industry was an education in how talent can overcome political connections in the movie industry i didnt think they could top the big lebowski so i didnt see o brother where art thou until now in fact i have to admit that o brother now is the best movie ever made in fact they dont even make movies they make works of art i know that reviewers like rodger ebert are not that impressed but thats only because they have to take the movies seriously and not as just entertainment first i think the soul of america is in its humor and not knee jerk political correctness,black_comedy
saw this a year ago in the cinema i am a huge coen fan and expected to be overwhelmedbut i was a little disappointed didnt laugh as loud as with big lebowski and it wasnt as sharp as fargo or blood simple i picked it up at the videostore and watched it again the other night on dvd i laughed louder and saw the genius in the apparently rambling lazy scriptwriting the dialogue is so brilliant you have to see it multiple times esp when you do not come from the states but it pays off clooney is brilliant as is everyone else the music so good you want to hear it again it is made by two of the most origianal and inventive directors at work today  i am goin apey brilliant i am gonna buy it on dvd for sure 9 out of 10 probably 10 out of 10 next time,black_comedy
this a fantastic movie of three prisoners who become famous one of the actors is george clooney and im not a fan but this roll is not bad another good thing about the movie is the soundtrack the man of constant sorrow i recommand this movie to everybody greetings bart,black_comedy
great movie great actors great soundtrack i loved it settings are perfect dialogues situations storyline all together mixed to give this masterpiece clooney and turturro are magnificent and the soggy bottom boys are simply charming and contagious with their music ,black_comedy
ive seen just about all of the coen brothers films now and i have to say this is one of their better films  i wouldnt dare say its better than the big lebowski but it was very good in its own righti thought the story was very interesting and hilarious at times  i loved all the characters especially tim blake nelson delmar and john turturros petethere really isnt anything bad i can say about this movie but this movie isnt for everyone  it might be safe to say that if you liked the other coen brothers films then youll hopefully like this one too  and if you liked what you saw in the trailer i think youll like the film but dont hold me to itanyhow i hope that you liked the film as much as i do  thanks for readingchris,black_comedy
the coens strike again i had no presuppositions going in and i was amazed at the bizarre telling of a goodbad guy story although clooney is easily replaceable in this his cornball style is welcome turturro and nelson are dead ringers and i loved i am a man of constant sorrow as performed by the soggy bottom boys catchy tune8 of 10,black_comedy
the coen brothers do it again  this is their best movie since raising arizona  this movie was based on the tale of homers the oddessy in a 1930s setting in the deep south  three bumbling and inept convicts escape from a chain gang to find a treasure  they get into a lot of mishaps and they meet a variety of characters who bare resemblence to the characters from the original oddessy  ie the singing whores were supposed to be the sirens  george clooney gives an outstanding performance as ulysess  george clooney is great in whatever movies he makes which is probably why he has captivated so many fans like me since his role as dr ross on er  a hearttouching riveting and uplifting movie its one of those movies you can watch over and over again  i give it 4 stars,black_comedy
a gleeful retelling of homers odyssey set in 1930s mississippi and rampant with splendid quirkiness that is the trademark of the brothers coen three hapless convicts make their escape to find treasureand more than their share of adventurein this delightful film george clooney is in fine ingenuous form as the chatty amiable leader of the trio but the real acting kudos go to john turturro and tim blake nelson as his goofy but lovable cohorts dubbed the soggy bottom boys by clooneys character after they receive baptism by full immersion in a river the three cut a record under that homespun nomdeplume for the cash and unwittingly become overnight sensations with veritable rock star status the film is accompanied by enough music and songs to almost qualify it as a musical and there are some incredible feats of filmmaking here the scene at the kkk rally is a real doozy and is so similar to the scene when dorothys friends rescue her from the witchs castle in the wizard of oz that it almost amounts to cinematic plagiarism and what an amazing work of plagiarism it is without giving away the ending i must say the climax of the movie is one of the most breathtaking sequences put to film in recent memory on a par with the spectacular finale of magnolia another one of my favorites o brother is a mustsee a perfect 10,black_comedy
i recently saw this movie on dvd too bad i missed it in the movie theatre it was so witty it cracked me up the music is excellent i just had to go and buy the soundtrack and the scenes were often so beautiful that you really need a big screen to fully appreciate it this is definitely one of the best movies that i have seen so far,black_comedy
just saw the film last night and was struck by how much george clooney seemed to be playing his character as clark gable would have so much from the mustache to the cadence and tone of his speech had gable all over it watch it happened one night and you will see what has to have been clooneys inspirationhaving seen clooney in so many other roles and never like this means this had to be an intentional impersonation it actually fits with the story  many a fellow in 1937 would no doubt from pomade to manner of speaking have liked to emulate gable the consummate leading man of the dayi have searched through many reviews and comments on this film and have been surprised not to see this mentioned,black_comedy
this has got to be the best movie ive seen  you definately have to watch it more than once to find all of the humor and twists  im no fan of george clooney but he shines here  the real performance comes from tim blake nelson and john turturro as pete and delmar  one of the few movies that i own,black_comedy
it started off weird the middle was weird and the ending was weird but i really really liked it  a modern day version of homers odyessy but that is really irrelevant  interesting story and casting  clooney was great and i applaud him for taking on such an adverterous role  so unlike anything he has done or ever will do again  lots of surprise stars  why isnt holly hunter in more  do something different tonight and watch this really different and unexpected flick,black_comedy
after seeing the oh so acclaimed fargo and thinking it was nothing more than average i was wandering if it would be a good idea to rent another coen masterpiece this time i was much less disappointed than i was with fargo and i must say that most of the credit for that goes to the good jokes and the good acting of george clooney well done mr clooney make more of these and less perfect stormish movies you can act and you showed it here7 out of 10,black_comedy
this movie was sooooooo good it was hilarious there are so many jokes that you can just watch the movie over and over and not get tired of it john turturro and tim blake nelson were awesome as pete hogwallop and delmar i love those guys i love the adventures they went on too i definitely recommend this moviealso the music in this movie is terrific i love singing along with all of the songs,black_comedy
it takes a rare movie to get better each time you see it o brother does that and then some the first time i saw it i have to admit i had never seen anything like it then i wanted to see it again and now im up to double digits with this great movie the coen brothers finest movie theyve ever done with fargo and hudsucker proxy coming in a tight second and third for megeorge clooney gives the performance of his career playing ulysses everett mcgee a fasttalking knowitall escaped convict who really doesnt know that much at all tim blake nelson and john turturro are the perfect sidekicks for clooney particularly nelson and his portrayal of delmar a loyal albeit uneducated fellow escapee john goodman is my favorite bit character as big dan perfect it reminds me of his part in raising arizona hes just a perfect actor for this role coen brothers favorites holly hunter and charles durning also provide memorable performances joel and ethan coen are masters of their trade its not like they try to win academy awards every time they make a film they just try and tell a story that they want to tell and its entertaining its a loose adaptation of the odyssey and i mean loose for all of you homer fanatics its just greatthe most amazing part of this movie though is the coloring ive watched how they got the dusty feel to the movie and i am still in awe just thinking about it the coloring does become an important part of the movie great great movie,black_comedy
three southern men escape from depressionera prison to find treasure in this coen film loosely based on the odyssey can be a bit goofy at times stretching the liberty of imagination too far but its flaws are overcome by the sheer strength of the performances most notably clooney with his sly persona strong cast and images give wellmeaning to the film although the central idea is hard to grasp yet another brilliant and unique craft from the coen brothers,black_comedy
the coen brothers deliver a spectacular soundtrack accompanied by a film which is truly beautiful to look at but nearly impossible to watch  its a series of very much unrelated episodessome scenes which would stand on their own as short experimental films but taken as a whole produce no more than a hodgepodge of selfconscious exercises in cinematic technique  the soundtrack deserves its monumental success but the film was fortunate to do lukewarm business at the box office,black_comedy
i am still kicking myself for not seeing this film in the theater when it first came out oh well at least i had the good sense to catch up with it on my local payperview cable channel about a month ago i can honestly say that ive only been surprised by a movie a few times and this is one of those times i saw george clooney in the perfect storm and thought he did a very good job in that film but i wasnt prepared for what o brother had in store ive seen raising arizona and fargo and am definitely a coen fan but obwat is in a league all by itself its spirit is simple and poetic its actors are deadon its screenplay is virtually flawless its cinematography gorgeous and its soundtrack is one that with have you hummingsingingwhistling for a long time after surreal is a word that comes to mind to describe many of the scenes the escapees are 3 of the funniest characters youll ever meet on film charles durning as gov pappy lee odaniel makes me laugh just thinking about his portrayal along with his advisors and his rotund son junior and all of the other supporting characters make for a superb collection of contributors to this rare jewel i replay my tape of it to the auditorium scene over and over just to savor the exuberant return of the soggy bottom boys if you havent seen obwat youre missing a treat 1010,black_comedy
the question someone should be asking is how almost 10000 people watched and rated this movie and about 75 of them gave it an 8 out of 10 and 8 what would you give a good movie a 50 out of 10the movie was cute the humor subtle and the music good but it is not worth an eight,black_comedy
i cant say i enjoyed this as much as the big lebowski or raising arizona and felt a little slighted but o brother is an enjoyable film worthy of some good laughs and a taste of the coens brisk twisted sense of creativity  the dvd edition contains the featurette and i was interested to find out that the coens are pretty simple in their directorial techniques  that surprised me  of course this movie is not the best example and im only saying this in comparison and it wasnt worthy of any oscars many feel it was robbed but maybe it depends on the appeal though i enjoyed the coens previous work ive never been a fan of old westerns or the dukes of hazzard or any of that stuff they show daily on tnn  i guess thats why i didnt feel as enthusiastic about checking out this movie seeing that it revolves around southern folk  for all those from the south who are reading this i dont mean to offend any of your people  im sure you guys feel the same way when you watch movies about urban areas like a bronx tale  when you live in the city all your life its hard to get accustomed to films of this nature  but all apologies aside i found the characters fun and quirky  i think john turturro nailed the accent perfectly and seeing the way he talks in real life i find that amazing  tim blake nelson was also good  of course george clooneywho i assume is not the best at feigning accents judging by his decision to chuck the idea of working with a dialogue coach and developing a new england accent for the perfect stormnaturally seems a little miscast and continually struggles with the accent  his performance was good though you can also spot coen regulars like holly hunter in a short but sweet role and john goodman also on screen for a short time but steals every minute of itthough i dont normally dig country music i liked the title song a man of constant sorrow  the dvd also contains the music video for that song overall i found the film entertaining and original but it doesnt have that inyourface quality that the coens have shown to us in the past  its a slighter effort but a good one  i still suggest you check it out my score  7 out of 10,black_comedy
the only other coen brothers film ive seen is fargo and i fully enjoyed that movie when i saw commercials for o brother i had no clue what the movie was supposed to be about but seeing that it was a coen brothers film i decided it was worth a watch i was extremely pleased watching this film on an airplane then on home video this movie is an extremely fun fare not serious in the slightest if you want a realistic funfilled journey watch this film,black_comedy
a very humorous movie based on homers odysseythree depression era convicts escape their mississippi chain gang on the promise of sharing 1 million in cash  left over from a bank jobas they head toward their big pay off the convicts come across an assorted mysterious and quirky range of characters who sometimes confuse you but whose purpose knits together by the endgeorge clooney acting scarily like a young jack nicholson stars as the hair cream obsessed escapee leader while john turturro and tim blake nelson feature as good olboysbig bad john goodman has a star turn as a cyclopic bible salesman while holly hunter also appearsa fantastic film about friendship and redemption among other things with some surprisingly great country and western music that will have you laughing until the soggy bottomed end,black_comedy
first off if you havent seen the old movie sullivans travels try toscare up a copy before watching this  theres a real connectionand being aware of it just makes your appreciation of this moviethat much deeperthis should have gotten the oscar for best picture last year  andafter giving it to this film they should have stopped giving it forabout ten years  its that goodi love everything the coen brothers have done but this filmtranscends  its the best film ive seen in years  it just may be thegreat american novel  high school english teachers say huckfinn is but it was too early  america hadnt happened yet  highschool english teachers say huck finn was based on theodyssey just like this film isits very easy for me to wax mystical about this film  its a mysticalfilm  by setting it in a mythical version of mississippia land thatexists in its purest form in old country blues and protobluegrasssongsthe coens have tapped into the motherlode the jugularvein of american myth  this is the real americathe absurdity thecruelty the violence the beauty the deceit the dapper dan  thisis the best americathe america that gave birth to robert johnsonand the carter family  critics used to say that the coen brothers were technically brilliantand emotionally cold filmmakers  i never understood that and i getit even less now  this movie has more heart more passion andlove and spirit than just about anything else i can think of perfect performances george clooney gives us the ride of hislife breathtakingly beautiful cinematography and the bestsoundtrack maybe ever  mark twain would be proud  1010,black_comedy
i wasnt sure what to expect from o brother where art thou homers odyssey set in the deep south during the great depression a premise like that screams arty film and an arty film usually equates to bad film look no further than the avengers to see a what i mean on the other hand it was the product of the coen brothers and i was quite entertained by the hudsucker proxy so i thought i might like it and if anyone can pull off an arty film its the coen brothersthe story revolves around chiefly around three men who escape from a chain gang and rush to collect a hidden treasure before the place where it is hidden is flooded by a dam project along the way they have a variety of interesting and amusing experiencesgeorge clooney plays the head convict ulysses everett mcgill a man obsessed with having perfectly slickedback hair with nothing less than dapper dan hair gel to the point of wearing a hair net while sleeping he is accompanied by the rather dull mentally pete hogwallop john turturro and the even duller delmar odonnell tim blake nelson their onscreen exploits are to say the least hilariousone of the funniest parts is how ulysses as described in one review manages to pull ten dollar words from a fivecent brain my favorite scene was when the three cons still chained together attempt to hop a moving train ulysses hops on and faces a group of hobos as the second convict climbs aboard ulysses says any of you boys smithies or if not smithies per se were you otherwise trained in the metallurgic arts before straitened circumstances forced you into a life of aimless wanderin during this the last con trips and falls while trying to board the train dragging the other two off with himthe cinematography is as usual gorgeous and the music compliments the story and location nicely particularly good was the number performed by the three convicts in the story to earn some extra moneythe storyline does wander somewhat but considering the topic its actually rather appropriate if you like other movies produced by the coen brothers youll definitely like this,black_comedy
when i saw this movie in the theater i was the only person laughing  half of the audience walked out on the movie after the first 15 minutes  most likely because they were bored  personally i enjoyed the photography some of the music and a lot of the jokes which tended to be very dry and low key  this is not a movie for everyone  this is very much an art film,black_comedy
yet again the coen brothers have made a uniquely entertaining film in o brother where art thou three escaped convicts george clooney tim blake nelson john turturro leave the chain gang in search of treasure and of home encountering an odyssey of strange adventures as they amble through the depressionera south john turturro tim blake nelson do a wonderful job of playing affable dimwits and clooney puts in a topnotch performance as a flimflam artist whos about as dumb as his two fellow escapees    he just knows more highfalutin words that make him sound smart  the other cast members are equally impressive  charles durning john goodman and michael badaluco all put in some stunning performances as welllike most joel and ethan coen movies the story is both bizarre and highly entertaining with some memorable oneliners punctuating some equally memorable scenes  were in a tight spot where the movie falls short of some of their other efforts is the overall plot  o brother is more a mishmash of loosely related scenes than an actual story as such it sometimes drags or otherwise fails to grab your attention still all in all quite good  and id be remiss if i didnt mention the delta bluegrass soundtrack which adds a healthy amount of texture and depth to the laidback charming fun that is o brother where art thou b,black_comedy
we can all count on the coen brothers giving us an offbeat presentation and this is no different there were moments in this film where i felt like a smile was glued to my face but every once in a while a scene would come along and be completely disturbing animals crushed under cars kkk meetings it came along too abruptly perhaps they were sticking to the formula in homers the odyssey by juxtaposing the pleasant with the horror but i always felt that homers book had more horror than pleasantness to it which made the transition more welcome still it is an interesting film to sit through if only because you will not be able to predict what will follow from one scene to the next and clooney is very good here as well his best work since out of sight now if i want to smile all the way through ill listen to the outstanding soundtrack great music,black_comedy
i found this movie to be very enjoyable and was fascinated with the almost surreal integration of music within the movie the movie manages to poke fun at many things in a playful but effective way  the brothersthree raid on the kkk lynching and the resulting dissentegration of the grand dragons political career is a wonderful example of such commentary,black_comedy
this movie is wonderful for anyone whos looking for something fun and whimsical  check it out if you enjoyed movies like raising arizona or of course fargo or if you enjoyed the tv series northern exposure  the genius here is in pairing slightly warped very clever and sharply defined characters with the thick cultural essence and stereotypes of depression era mississippianother reason o brother is so great is that one really begins to root for the success of the characters whitetrash never looked so good these characters capture you george clooney further strips himself of his prettyboy image as he fantasticaly becomes the smooth talking trickster and allows himself to be the very lucky fool  tim blake nelson as delmar is a gentle and innocent addition allowing us to not only find this bunch interesting but endearing as well these men both deserve an oscar nodsince the movie is based on the oddessy the cohen brothers allow the soundtrack and several actual singing groups to be the chours the music enriches the experiencegive it a try youll be hooked,black_comedy
i dont understand it  a movie starring george clooney written and directed by the coens is not a big smash  i laughed out loud  i sang out loud  i couldnt believe it  this movie is hysterical with enough twists and turns to keep you very interested  a must see more than just one time,black_comedy
although i had my reservations about seeing this film it turned out to be another good offering from the coen brothers ive seen all their films except barton fink and ive liked them all if you like the coen brothers especially their comedies you will like this film if you dont like the coen brothers this film probably wont change your mind since it is very much in keeping with their other films,black_comedy
despite several errors of continuity and so forth it makes no pretense of being a documentary this is worth ones time and moneyregarding people who are offended at one thing or another about this movie and there is something for just about everyone in this regard if you want to dwell on them they need to a get a life andor b stop sweating the small stuff,black_comedy
the year 2000 seemed like a year when no decent movies were going to be released  with such a poor selection of movies it would be ridiculous to even suggest that any other film in 2000 is better than this  not only enjoyable on an intellectual level but an emotional level as well  the only problem that i have with it is the decision to credit homer in the opening credits i would have liked to find that out on my own  there is simply no excuse for not seeing this movie,black_comedy
i was looking forward to this given its rating but was left wandering how its scored so highclooney just doesnt work for me perhaps its his overbearing looks but i just dont buy into his acting some great supporting roles though which make it enjoyable the plots predictable,black_comedy
the actors in this movie did good jobs portraying their characters unfortunately the characters were just more of the same old tired southern stereotypes you see in movie after movie take out about three cute scenes and a little bluegrass music and not much of a movie is left save your money,black_comedy
okay why am i the only person to catch thisthe scene with the klansmen in the woods chantingsingingmarching in formations has been described here and in the media over and over as a busby berkeley parody  wrongo  its an homage to the scene in the wizard of oz where the tin man scarecrow and cowardly lion knock out three of the witchs chantingsingingmarching guardsmen dress up in their uniforms and rescue dorothy  in o brother the escaped cons knock out three of the klansmen disguise themselves in their sheets and rescue the black guitarist from being lynched  even the way clooney turturro and blake awkwardly move and tug at their sheets is a precise mimicking of the three characters in oz  its brilliantshouldnt i win some kind of prize,black_comedy
while i have enjoyed all of the coens brothers previous works i have to say that this movie is probably one of worst films i saw this year if only because i had such respect for their previous works that i went in with high expectations the problem as i see it is that the script was trying too hard there are far too many scenes in the movie that do nothing to advance the story but simply exist to cause a recollection of homers work whole subplots could have been excised from the script most notably the sirens subplot which ended with the characters in exactly the same spot as they had been before but left the audience some 1015 minutes older same goes with the babyface subplot or the cyclops at least one of these 3 should have been cut from the script and the minutes added to the other subplots instead the coens include all three and meander between these scenes like a bad sitcom the coens strong point the creation of quirky characters is also sadly lacking in this feature what made lebowski work is that you knew where the characters were coming from same goes for fargo hudsucker raising arizona etc the audience came to know and love the characters quirks and the coens were able to let their quirks drive the movies in oh brother however the audience is never really allowed to see what makes the characters work and so the plot has to drive the movie as i noted previously this made the movie utterly unsuccessful because of the overloaded script on the whole i would give this movie only 310 only because of the music and because one of babyfaces lynchers yelled cow killer as if this were his greatest crime,black_comedy
o brother is simply put a spectacular tourdefarce that has all the elements required for a great movie in the style of old depression era hollywood before seeing this for the second time we rented sullivans travels by preston sturges it was really cool to see the references the coens did to sullivans travels in o brothernow a few comments about o brother the visuals were stunning from the antique cars to the grimy clothes to the brilliant yellow fields this movie gets an a for visual depth and brilliance  likewise the soundtrack is great im personally a fan of hillbilly music but even my husband and friends who arent could get into the great music also the dialogue was hilarious there are some great ludicrous gems in this movie also the characters were truly brilliant faulknerian in their tragic comedy after seeing this movie i wish the coens would do a film adaptation of as i lay dying imo one of the greatest epic comictragedies faulkner ever wrotethe characters brought this movie to life ulysses everett mcgill the fasttalking inventive paterfamilias played by george clooney was both likeable and ridiculous with his schemes  john tutturos flashing eyes and fierce expression coupled with his gravelly voice and molassesthick dialect stamped the role of pete on my heart and tim blake nelson played the innocent emptyheaded big hearted delmar with charm reminiscent of evell snopes in raising arizona  it was no wonder butterflies flocked to the childlike charming delmar if an excon may be called charmingthe secondary characters were also terrific mcgills estranged wife penny played by holly hunter the seven little wharvey gals the acerbic pappy odaniels played to the hilt  by charles durning the malefic big dan teague bible salesmancummugger hilariously played by john goodman george not babyface nelson tommy johnson and the devil just to name a fewby the way does anybody else think that the prison warden was the devil think about how tommy johnson described the devil at the crossroads then look at the wardenall in all to those to complain that this movie is pointless or just a bunch of stuff strung together i humbly suggest that that is what an odessey is it is a journey in which the journey itself is more important than the outcome o brother is an epic farce which brings together a rich stew of elements of depression era history politics and nostalgia mixes it with some truly outlandish humor and mythic storytelling and brings it all together to create one of the most heart warming feelgood movies i have ever seeni give this movie a 1010,black_comedy
and yes saw it in france with a french girl with french people all around and made a real discovery about the audiences but as far as the movie it was well you know like not so damn great being a coen and all and then theres the whole thing about the etc etc etc 30s and you know funny yes but for crying out loud not as wonderful as so many things the coensve done and who could disagree that the very presence of dr clooney was a terrible mark on the whole experience the black guard that he is the base sensualistbut as far the film itself regardless of the like twodimensional characters which yes one expects from the brothers you dont have any of the like mind blowing nice type of symbolic writing which you found in other of their films like  it was the twisting and wonderful writing and diolog without the like soul some how  yet for chrissakes still interesting to watch a coen brothers movie you know  what can one say,black_comedy
truly awful filmone of the worst i have ever seenthe humour of a seven year old delinquent with a story written by a two year oldthankfully i will never have to watch this utter garbage ever againas a coen brothers fan this film sticks out like a sore thumb and the amount of praise it gets leaves me scratching my head at mankindthe music like the film is annoying and the story is riddled with holes in itanybody who likes this film i put a black mark against its that badavoid like the plague,black_comedy
im sorry homerforgive and forget in this horrible season the tragedy goes on ill not waste many words for this useless and boring movie i have not to save someone refraining him from watching that because i was alone in all the theater and this fact means that all other possible audience already knew bye,black_comedy
oh brother where art thou is a very strange film i wonder if im just not the right kind of person to watch and enjoy this i know lots of viewers like this movie but i absolutely hate it i think george clooney is a very talented actor and i usually like him both on the big screen and in real life but he just really annoyed me here his acting seems way too over the top funny and its all just too obvious what i mean by that is that i dont really like it when actors deliver comedic lines so obviously that its not funny i prefer more drywitty type humor but its not just the way the actors say the lines its also the writing its too over the top and obvious when comedic dialogue is written in that way in my opinion they lose their appeal and amusement factor it drains the funny reaction out that the audience is supposed to experience and the issue is that its not like this movie drops lines like that its all the time i could forgive a few moments like that but not all throughout the whole thing so really since the comedy didnt work for me and actors that i normally like were held captive to this bad writing the whole thing just doesnt work also i really hate bluegrass music so whenever that would occur it would just make it that much worse 110,black_comedy
i am about as unsouthern as they come boston bred and la raisin the only connection i have to the south is when they call la the southland be that as it may i had the misfortune to watch this movie tonightpeople write about the coen brothers doing their thing what is that stupidity inanity oh excuse me inanity is considered the new sophistication well lordy lordy lordy lordy george clooney was passable and does john turturo demand a lobotomy before he signs a contract he sure acted it in this film thats two movies ive seen in the past few weeks this and transformers in which turturo better watch out for christmas because hes one heck of a hammer i guess subtlety is a thing of the past the whole intent of this movie seems to throw as many southern stereotypes at the wall and see what sticks well you know what people selling trash in the guise of art are a thousand times hickier than anything portrayed in this moviethink i didnt get the joke well the joke is on you for thinking this pile of doodoo is worth crap,black_comedy
the cinematography in this is excellent  however even an excellent painting wears thin if theres nothing to do but stare at it  this was perhaps clooneys best role but thats not saying much  hes still terrible just slightly less so than usual  the soundtrack is an utter headache when it doesnt grate on your ears it puts you asleep  the socalled comedy bits are way too subtle to get any entertainment out of it  the plot makes no sense if youre not familiar with the odyssey and if you are it just strikes you as a rediculous substitutionin its defense any moment on the screen is good to look at but the movie has no movement to it  the action is slow the comedy isnt funny and the drama isnt dramatic  whatever this film was trying to be it failed at being so,black_comedy
this movie dragged horribly in the middle actually for most of the movie the first 1015 minutes were ok and ending was ok but the middle just stank why would any man care to get out of jail to be with a wife like that how can this movie be rated so high,black_comedy
this film does not do the brothers coen justice the humor is strained the writing often predictable and it almost seems like the actors are just going through their paces the fact that it is constantly being fixed tinkering with it compressing it etc before american release just goes to show that the distributors realize this too the best thing about this film is the music suggestion wait for it to come out on dvd or video,black_comedy
i could not wait for the movie to end should have been titled the three stooges in mississippi the movie starts out slow and stays slow i dont know why it is getting good reviews clooney must not have enjoyed the movie either he was not very good in his part,black_comedy
despite me giving this film a 10 it is not my favorite coen brothers film that honor would go to the even more bizarre and quirky hudsucker proxy however it still is an amazingly good film the first time i saw it i might have scored it an 8 but now after seeing it again i find myself laughing even harder and enjoying it even more plus while the film is a hilarious retelling of homers odyssey i find myself spotting more and more story elements from this great book the cleverness in doing this was truly a work of genius on top of that the music is so infectiously fun that you cant help but tap your feet and even sing alongits that goodthe film begins with the escape of three idiots from a chain gang the normally handsome george clooney is rather greasy and stubbly looking but he always manages to look far more attractive than his incredibly ugly and occasionally dimwitted sidekicks i liked john turturro quite a bit but especially fun was tim blake nelson as the dumbest and ugliest of the lot he was incredibly funny throughoutespecially when he was convinced that turturro had been turned into a frog much like when odysseus men had been turned into pigs in the odysseyhowever these three guys were not the whole show as like most of the best coen films they are surrounded by the best supporting performances you can find in film charles durning who was great in the hudsucker proxy was delightful as the wily old governor and holly hunter was wonderfully awful but so many wonderful actors and actresses adorned this lovely film so many odd faces much like a fellini film and quirky personalities made this film truly memorablethe look and sound of the film was also terrificwith a real nice early 1930s look about it and great sepiatoned cinematography and the best toetappinest soundtrack ive heard in years i usually hate old time country music but the songs they chose were amazing and the actors did a great job in pretending to be singing the songssee this film in fact after you see this film see anything the coens madethe hudsicker proxy raising arizona the man who never was intellerable cruelty millers crossing and pretty much most of their other wonderful films oddly while it won so much fame one of their worst and most disappointing films was fargoa one joke film plus i gotta admit that barton fink really fell apart towards the end,black_comedy
i just saw this movie it was garbage i got dragged to it by a friend who gave it a 10  she wanted to see quills more as did i to be honest i didnt want to see this at all since she doesnt like to see dramas late at night i deferred to her and unfortunately ended up suffering through this i admit i am not a big fan of the coen brothers but this was really bad even for them they are more ambitious than their talent can support imo joel coen should not be allowed to direct anything he and his brother have written the script forthe combination of really stupid humor and highbrow artistry in this movie made for an annoying experience yeah yeah the performances were good or better for the most part but they didnt come close to redeeming this pile of dung a wittier andor more realistic screenplay i say this knowing that the movie wasnt trying to be realistic be prepared for a lot of masturbatory ridiculousness if you see it certainly would have though i personally gave it a 2 it was going to be 25 until the incredibly painful scenes at the end because i laughed a few times and it had a few good fairly esoteric references,black_comedy
i know i may get a bit of flack because this is a coen brothers film and it is an interesting take on the odyssy but i couldnt help but find myself checking the clock from time to time when the film is good its really good but the lulls in between can make this film feel longer than it is,black_comedy
this slightly amusing tale of 3 escaped convicts is saved by its music yes there are a few humorous moments that produced a chuckle or two but i wouldnt sit through it again unless it was to hear the musicconsidering the acting talent in the movie its hard to believe its as forgettable as it is george clooney does a very good job of lip synching to dan tyminski allison krause  union station although it is uncredited so those without the thought that george clooney doesnt sing that well he might remember his aunt rosemary may never discover dans music for themselves that would be a sad thing,black_comedy
o brother where art thou features some of the best and worst tendencies of the coen brothers as they reexamine another movie genre the cinematography is lush  where fargo was visually about white millers crossing visually about dark and barton fink fascinated by the look of fire o brother lingers over golden and amber waves of grain in fargo i thought the coens had genuine love for their home turf underneath the satire and cruelty but here we have a south of yokel myth that makes preston sturges magical sullivans travels which this is close to a remake ofseem like a documentary the daughters of the confederacy who walked out of gone with the wind for showing that the south lost the war between the states would surely walk out of this onelike a humorous counterpoint to dancer in the dark this feels like a european musicals look at the south of the great depression from corrupt politicians to chain gangs to river baptisms to kkk rallies road kill bbqs and bank robberies but it comes alive through the overpowering music selected by tbone burnett that becomes the central focus of the movie complete with a pilgrimage to a radio station as in american graffiti but with a commercial and political exploitation angle hey a man there will pay you for singing into a can few other than public radio listeners will feel disconcerted having the very distinctive voices of allison krauss emmy lou harris gillian welch the fairfield 4 and ralph stanley come out of actors mouths like in pennies from heaven because the music is the basis for mesmerizing highly theatrical setpieces it must have been at the directors direction that john torturro gives the worst performance of his otherwise exemplary career and tim blake nelsonis worse as their faces are frozen in ma and pa kettle stereotypes george clooney tries a southern accent for 30 seconds then gives up which is ironic as he was born and raised in kentucky his container of dapper dan hair pomade becomes an ongoing leitmotif like the hat in millers crossing with no significance other than the visual i did miss the opening minute or so due to strong hunger pains and a slow refreshment line but i dont think seeing the opening quote from homer would have changed my impression i recommend the soundtrack rather than the videooriginally written 12302000,black_comedy
what a disappointment i had read so many good reviews of this movie that i was really looking forward to it but it was a major disappointment both me and my daughter fell asleep towards the end the film had two serious flaws  i couldnt understand the dialogue due to the strong southern drawl and when i could hear what was said it wasnt funny apparently it was based on the oddysey by homer and  like most classic literature  the film was slow difficult to follow and boring,black_comedy
i have never been so glad to see the end of a movie come  a few people had told me to go see this movie and id laugh the whole way through  wrong  i kind of chuckled once and that was seeing george clooney dance a little jig toward the end  i noticed that it was only the late 40s and above crowd that was laughing in the theater  my friend and i were laughing in disbelief at the people who were laughing at this movie  the music was the best part so i shouldve just bought the soundtrack instead,black_comedy
i wish i walked out of the theater on this one  silly mei thought just when i left it would get good  it never got good  it was handsdown the worst movie i have ever seen in my life  if i sat in the theater and left the projector off i would have had a better time  at least i wouldnt have had to listen to that awful music  the characters were so dimwittedi felt like i was watching monkeys at the zoo  really dumb monkeysonce i recovered from what the coen brothers had subjected me to i managed to get home to check the imdb  i wanted to see if the word was out on how awful this movie was  i saw that it was criminally overrated by people that wrote reviews  these reviews mean a lot  i usually base my movie viewing decisions imdb commentsi want to make it very clear that this movie is not for everyone  the coen brothers have a vocal minority that enjoys their movies  these are the people that wrote the reviews for this movie  this is a small minority this film did not make a lot of money  when the awful soundtrack was disappearing off the shelves at your local music store it was this small vocal minority that was buying it  if you can try to listen to some of the songs  the music does not have any mainstream appeal at all  you could say the same thing about this entire movie  im sure its the perfect movie for someone on this planet just not me or anyone else ive ever met,black_comedy
this is one of the worst films i have ever seengeorge clooney is a great actor when he stars in a good or even mediocre film but in many respects he reminds me of steve mcqueen whenever he takes a role in a poor film his presence alone is not enough to carry the story and he is very poor at comedy or self parodyoh brother is a perfect example of a bad film that george clooney cannot save the acting is juvenile the story is dreary and rambling and the only good aspect the title song is only sung once or twicedisappointing all around,black_comedy
how else to retell a classic greek poem than in the deep souththe story of pete everett and delmar is one of humor adventure and peril they are on the run from the law and hope to recover a heap of money to make all their woes float away along their travels they meet a cadre of merry pranksters fellow criminals musicians and even klansmen their resolve and courage are tested time and time again throughout the filmthe setting is gorgeous it soddens you down and makes you feel warm and lazy like youre sitting on a porch with a jug of whiskey watching the scenes unfold before you the soundtrack is a winning combination of bluegrass country and folk numbers that embellish the setting even more soevery line of dialogue is smart fitting perfectly within the big picture the blocking is clever and on point you feel very much for the downtrodden protagonists and their quest for redemption and hope they get away from the long arm of the law which is portrayed in a terrifying waythis epic tale although derived from ancient literature becomes its own tale and slowly wins over the hearts and minds of the audience with style wit humor and adventure the coens have a firm grasp of the picture from start till endterrific terrific film,black_comedy
if your favourite colour is brown then you will love this filmtbh for all of the bumph about homer and the clunking badly written and frankly baffling plot by the time it reached the end it reminded of nothing so much as the wizard of oz and not in a good way of course there is such a thing as suspension of disbelief but there is equally demanding that the audience switch off brain faculty and hope that a leftfield reputation and gorgeous george will be enough to disguise lack of contentit was entertaining in that i didnt switch it off but it was completely soulless and without emotion and doesnt lead to me to want to watch another cohen brothers film again ever,black_comedy
this film is very wellshot its images of the 1930s south are visual candy and the eyes dont have all the fun the soundtrack is even better with the man of constant sorrow only one of a dozen excellent tracksbut in terms of writing directing and acting o brother is a disappointment  structured loosely around homers odyssey the tone remains cynical and detached  clooney awarded a golden globe for his starring role should be applauded for trying something different but his performance seems like it was pulled from an extended bit part  his two dim buddies likewise underdeveloped and played as twodimensional buffoons embody the sneering jests the coen brothers make about southern culture,black_comedy
i was surprised how boring this movie was it sounded good but it was very boring coen brothers usually make good movies fargo and barton fink were good this movie and big lebowski are just awful but anyway acting is very good in this movie too bad that the movie is so boring cinematography is another good thing in this movie  out of  ,black_comedy
ive sunk to a new low for friday night entertainmentprior to seeing this ive heard ratings from 0 to 10  i give it a 3  what a disjointed collection of garbage  it was almost bad enough to warrant turning it off but how can you comment on something you didnt finish  i think i laughed about a half dozen times  my two coviewers laughed even less one even commenting something to the effect of what a waste of 2 hours  thankfully it wasnt quite that long it just seemed like itclooney was okay but with that terrible accent he sounded like he was talking with a mouthful of mississippi mud  was it just me or did that accent disappear and reappear several timesi also had a hard time keeping up with the plot holes  where did this car go  where did that car go  what was the deal with the blind policeman how could a river flood and fill up the valley so fast  did they just keep going in circles to end up in the same places and near the same peoplejust plain bad,black_comedy
the coen bros are usually the most obscurely directors working today  i say usually because with o brother where art thou they went from perfecting the obscure to dwelling in idiocy  the film might be gorgeous to look at but underneath the lush cinematography is a pin headed script with dreadful performancesmany admire the film because they love the blue grass barnyard yokel music but i have never been one to reside in the the south so i didnt buy it,black_comedy
i watched this movie because it featured john turturro one of the finest actors of our time but this movie is boring no two ways about it ive heard time and time again how great the music is but great music doesnt make a great movie it simply makes a great soundtrack o brother cant decide where it wants to go is it about a man and his distant wife a singing group convicts looking for treasure a political race etc the movie is a collection of scenes that dont tie together normally if you film 100 different scenes something funny will happen if only by accident not in this movie why do i need to submit 10 lines i thought nine was sufficient,black_comedy
you know a film is in sorry shape when the film makers stage a klan rally as though it were a halftime show at a football game and still cant make it funny or interesting the characters in this film are sorry stereotypes theyre from the south so naturally they are presented as morons the oracle is of course a blind man the politicians are fat and crooked etc the story wants to ramble but the direction is sloppy and clumsy the films only asset is the music i am not a coen brothers fan i find their work cold mechanical and lacking simple humanity that is fine for a stylish film noir like blood simple but cruel almost sadistic in films like raising arizona or fargo they are akin to kubrick not necessarily a compliment in that they have neither the desire nor the talent to explore human nature or emotions in anything but the most superficial manner thinking about o brother i cant help but think that robert altman in his prime could have made something fascinating and wonderful out of this material as is the film is typically coen empty and flashy and absolutely forgettable,black_comedy
as i write i find myself wondering why this one gets me laughing so hard and i think its for a lot of reasons the first is that there is something hilarious to me about adapting a story like the iliad a classic in the greek foundational principles sense of the word high myth heros journey and setting it in the deep south during the great depression there couldnt be anything less grand than thatthe other thing i find so funny are the characters between the three of them everett george clooney burn after reading pete john turturro barton fink and delmar tim blake nelson the ballad of buster scruggs are each one of them hilarious on their own but the interplay between them is pricelesseverett is the fast talking knowledgeable man of the world always scheming and angling for what will give him an edge he may be knowledgeable but hes not always right or even trying to be right hes just trying to get his own way and facts exaggerations stories and quickly spoken half truths are his way of doing itpete is easily out matched by everett because while he may have a better sense of what is just and looks out for what is fair and right he is also dumb as such everett almost always gets away with whatever he wants and pete is left continually frustrated in his attempts to make sure he isnt getting the short strawdelmar is dumb as well but sweet he wants everyone to just get along and is always looking to be helpful of course as everett pete and pretty much any other person they run into is always looking to pull one over on each other this puts him in the awkward position of never really knowing whose side to be on since hes on everyones sidethis trio of silliness leads to some of the funniest back and forth conversations shouting matches and name calling ive ever seen on screenthe last thing that makes this movie really funny to me and i know this is controversial is the southern drawl of every character in this film my grandmother was originally from arkansas and while her accent has much diminished over the 35 years ive known her it was very strong to me when i was younger i always thought it was funny that she referred to meijer a local grocery chain as maars for me a southern accent is both funny and fond when i hear it so i know some people may not get the same feeling from this film as i do but for me it is a perfect combination to go with the themes of the moviethe themes in this film are certainly coen brother classics the values of brotherhood family sacrifice and hard work with edges of fate the supernatural or karmic justice are ever present in their films but the way they blend it with that southern gospel and dry dust working man mentality cuts through strong in this film it isnt lost on me that the three leads in this film form a close bond the film is called o brother where art thou and it was directed by the coen brothers as a brother myself i can attest to the spirit of camaraderie that can form between siblings and this film oozes with it there is nothing like the bond that can form between people when they journey together and seem to meld into one person in three bodies almostthe last thing i will extol in this film is the music i leave it for last because it is the best old time twang and southern gospel in its many forms upbeat and praise filled down low and mournful and wistful longing for a home that is not yet ours it is used for good and evil alike and the solace of those broken by life and their fellow human beings as well as the joy in the hearts of children still ignorant of lifes troubles there are many songs in this film that feels as if you might have been able to hear them on any summer evening as you drove by the porches of families all gathered outside to enjoy the cool breeze accompanying the setting sunperhaps that is what i actually love the most about this film the sense of coming home after hard times away the belief that while family is worth everything close friends are often the crucible through which we are refined and make us better people for our families when we do get home and join them the journey is not the destination but it does change us and make us into the people who will arrive there,black_comedy
this movie has enough star power to create an enjoyable film but it has underdeveloped characters and a bogged down script the coen brothers make it an enjoyable film but not something to watch repeatedly,black_comedy
not what i thought it was gonna bewas a very entertaining film,black_comedy
i like the flim of coen brothers for the following reasnos firstthe old folk in the begining of the flim is strange and misited he told the boys the treasure in the bottom of the lake but after all the treasure is the ring that belongs to the main charactor i think it happend because after the boys confession they didnt believed in god god saved his life but throw the ring away this time the old man in the very begining showed up i suppose god changed to him second georges wife was cural to her husbened just because he dont have money that is very differentplease dont look at it thanks,black_comedy

this is another great film from the cohen brothers while not as well known as some of their other classics o brother is a real gem of a film  a brilliantly unique and original comedy  adventure with an enjoyable storyline and some genuinely hilarious individual scenes its a real whacky offbeat comedy with equally eccentric characters that isnt intended to be taken seriously its clear that this film wants the audience to have fun and boy does it succeedo brother is also put together so well it looks great and is beautifully shot making the most of the rural setting and stunning scenery the coens attention to detail always shines through in their films and this one in particular stands out for how every scene is crafted to perfection its difficult to find any technical faults o brother is a quirky comedy gem from the coens  a hugely enjoyable film,black_comedy
much like other coen bros films its a love it or hate it kinda piece george clooneys character is probably much different to the usual roles he takes on which adds to the laughter and quirky ness of the filma lovely easy watching comedy with some fun music and plenty of smiles,black_comedy

what a brilliant and accessible modernish adaptation of this great book humour supreme turturo colloney goodman show their utmost class they are so versatile watch it and rewatch it now the music is wonderful too i loved the southern naiveity theme,black_comedy
im not entirely sure how to review this flick dont get me wrong it was enjoyable but something was missing that prevented this from being great essentially three chainmates who crush rocks on a prison farm escape in an attempt to find buried treasure but in typical coen fashion the group go from one crazy scenario to the other constantly from recording a country song for some cash to getting robbed by a oneeyed bible salesman from being seduced by sexy sirens to being disguised in kkk uniform its just crazy fun but there is just something about the narrative that seemsoff like i wasnt fully connected with this biblical journey thats filled with religious connotations i mean heck the main character is named ulysses i justdidnt get the purpose of the biblical context as a road caper its extremely enjoyable with plenty of humorous moments boasted with energetic performances by clooney nelson and turturro great supporting cast as well with dependable performances from goodman and hunter the scenarios that our characters are put under are also hilarious and instantly memorable as simple as falling from a train is it still produces a good laugh hence why i admire the simplicity that joel coen was going for its not overthetop slapstick humour its all in the dialogue the coen brothers pump out scripts that are consistently witty for every film they produce they are known for damn good dialogue and this film is no different i justcouldnt get on board with the context and subtext that was conveyed just didnt work for me but as a hilarious adventure road flick it works on every level might need to rewatch it at a later date to truly appreciate this not the coens most accessible film but still a good watch,black_comedy

o brother where art thou offers some very interesting mixes of comedy and drama that overall makes it a very successful adaptation of the odyssey i watched this film late at night so i was awake for most of the first act sort of like april and the extraordinary world the film managed to wake me up with its action though and i was wide awake for the rest of it laughing pretty hard at some of the jokes and getting captivated by the sense of mystery in certain scenes the cinematography is very well done portraying the southern us or what it seems like very well despite some areas where the color schemes of the set seem monochrome the odyssey is technically the story just replace the characters and finds an ideal balance between following the odyssey and adding its own concepts like the soggy bottom boys the characters were excellently cast and portrayed their counterparts in the odyssey with both a sense of sticking to the source material and being progressive most of the songs are catchy to listen to even if they dont enhance the tone of the movie or have dull parts its one film that you would want to consider viewing,black_comedy
written and directed by the coen brothers o brother where art thou tells the story of three depressionera mississippi prison fugitives ulysses everett mcgill george clooney pete hogwallop john turturro and delmar odonnel tim blake nelson on a journey to reach for the money buried in everetts backyard before that area slated to be flooded by a local dam project without spoiling the film too much i like the fact that entire plot contains various shout outs to the ancient greek poem the odyssey by author homer while the film doesnt follow the poem to the letter it does borrow some notable plot elements from it such as the blind man the cyclops the sirens and one of the main characters trying to get home to his wife so she wont marry someone else the connections to the poem can get pretty clever the more you look for them a good example is how everett is surrounded by peter and delmar which in greek means the rock and the sea referencing to the charybdis and scylla in the original poem even the term odyssey in the original greek can be roughly translated to constant sorrow which is aptly the title of the song that identifies our heroes although the fictional story is mostly based off the odyssey the canvas of the film come from the fictional bookmcguffin of the same name in preston sturges 1941 film sullivans travels since that sociallyconscious novel has never been define with any sense of a story besides some downtrodden themes taken from author john steinbeck 1932s film i am a fugitive from a chain gang william faulkners novel as i lay dying and the holy bible it allows the coen brothers to draw their own creative artistic license to make whatever was o brother where art thou supposed to mean one of those prominent themes is the idea of change in this film spiritualism is seem as a backward belief made for laughs that its not needed for the more modern and technologically advanced however given the ambivalence with which the movie treats the idea of reform and perhaps everetts change of heart toward the end it is ultimately left to the viewer to decide whether the vast reform of america brought about by technology is itself a stepbackwards or a step forwards i like that about this film another thing i like is how this film is almost a musical in many ways the coen brothers really wanted to make a period piece version of the 1980s comedy film blue brothers this comedy choice in direction allows the movie to have fun with the sophistical meaning of the themes without going all grim and somber while this movie might not have the action that blue brothers has this movie has nearly the same style of music both films emphasize the power that gospel and bluegrass music has on its characters both in positive and negative ways there is no better example of that then the down in the river to pray  go to sleep little baby didnt leave nobody but the baby sequences both songs are able to shown the struggles of being sinful while also righteous great singing from bluegrass singers alison krauss emmylou harris  gillian welch i also love the other songs on the soundtrack including music artist harry mcclintocks big rock candy mountain norman blakes you are my sunshine and in the jailhouse now by tim blake nelson yet the best song in the film has to be soggy bottom boys dan tyminski harley allen and pat enright i am a man of constant sorrow it really tells how life was like during one of the most downtrodden period of american history the notable use of dirges and other macabre songs in this film is wonderful hearing dark songs like o death angel band in contrast to bright cheerful songs keep on the sunny side in the highways in other parts of the film make this film one of the best movie soundtrack ever this film really shows how extreme poverty can indeed foster a rich musical tradition of classic hits another great thing about this film is how wellshot it was one of the notable features of the film is its use of digital color correction to give the film a sepiatinted look if they didnt do this the southern summer landscape would have been a bright green which is too cheerful for the dust bowltype feel they were going for director of photography roger deakins really did a wonderful job capturing that time period another thing that i love about this film is the acting everybody in the film ranging from supporting actors to the main actors were great in their roles mad props goes to george clooney for making this film a lot of fun i have always love his fun comedy side better than his dramatic roles it just sucks that he cant sing worth jack its a little more tragic because hes from a line of wellknown singers like famed cabaret singer and actress rosemary clooney anyways due of his lack of skills in the music department he had to be dubbed by dan tyminski during any part where singing was involved the other faults of the film is that many characters are introduced and then disappear seemingly without any point or purpose did we really need george babyface nelson michael badalucco to cameo in the film wasnt he dead in 1939 thats another problem with the film its not historical correct at all the real governor pappy o daniels was a texan and the films theme song you are my sunshine was written by louisianas depressionera governor jimmy davis however since its a fiction fantasy movie im willing to give this some leeway despite some faults this movie is a bodafine classic a must watch for any coen brothers fan overall go see it i do recommended,black_comedy
this is one of the rare examples where good story telling and good execution alone are enough without a strong morality at the end or guiding principle this is just a welltold cohens film therefor special and setting itself apart from other productions of its time in the world of cinema a modern fairy tale set in the early century deep south with all sorts of crazy unlikely events zany adventures particular characters found along the way and along the miles traveled by the protagonists miles of fun had by the viewers this is cinema in its most gratuitous form  a simple experience of taking in the produce from the minds of filmmaking creators and enjoying it to the fullest without any exercised effort to determine a particular goal within the plot or deeper meaning of the story just good fun a tale with a beginning and an end all the while rediscovering the folklore and flavors of that setting,black_comedy
inspired by the odyssey three escaped convicts from the south in the 1930s set out to find hidden treasure a rumor told to them by an old mani was very entertained by this film it has a realistic depiction with a touch of fantasy to it one that will really skew into some goofy scenes its a film that plays with your suspension of disbelief for a little but stays focused nonetheless the cast was well picked out with george clooney and john turturro as the lead as well as tim blake nelson all of which do an amazing job the tone is one of the best parts of the movie it should be a drama given the source material and the setting but it plays off as a light comedy with several over the top scenes that set up for an excellent music score the songs in this had me humming for days t bone burnett really did a good job in capturing the tone and time period for the film and it pays offthe film at times feels a little clustered with some big stars that dont get as much screen time holly hunter is pretty top billed but isnt around until three fourths of the movie the film is adapting itself into the odyssey so there are some appropriately added scenes that are there to be symbolism and even though its well done it kind of slows down the adventurous pace with that the fantasy element of this film is strong i feel like anything can happen in this movie and that anything is possible a free feeling i dont get in movies very oftennot one of my favorite coens but entertaining nonetheless with some great characters interesting storytelling and a fun tone and excellent music,black_comedy
im a huge fan of the coen brothers and really enjoyed this filmit does slow down a bit at places but is more for a mainstream audience than most of their films i love george clooneys character as a dumb man who thinks he has it all together john turturro is excellent as usual you stole from my kin and anyone whos seen the disney film holes will appreciate tim blake nelsons characterdefinitely some political undertones in the film but try not to read too much into them and youll enjoy an adventure film with some moments of comedy drama and many religious themes,black_comedy
three notsosmart convicts escape a chain gang in depressionera mississippi and in three stooges fashion go from one disaster to another the semihumorous plot is like a bad dream that goes on and on each segment brief and with little or no continuity to the segment that went before along the way our stooges encounter interesting oddball characters most of whom represent some stereotyped persona from that era in american history probably the most interesting of these characters is radio station man a blind one man outfit that records and plays corny songs to a local hick audiencegiven the surreal storyline lack of scene continuity is not a problem but some segments and some characters seem like unnecessary filler character exaggeration works well for some characters but not others toward the end the plot gets a little silly and the climax seems tacked onexcept for the wide ratio letterbox screen format color cinematography is terrific the brownish yellow sepia toned images which exist throughout convey an appropriately dry and old look consistent with the storys bygone era overall miseenscene design adds emotional support to that visual feeli could have wished for less screen time for george clooney whose character dominates the plot aside from that casting and acting are acceptable possibly the best element is that harmonic music a down home type that generally has gone out of style though it remains popular among mostly rural americansa splashy big budget inyourface satire of some elements in american history o brother  holds your attention as we journey dreamlike through a world of three guys whose collective iq may be limited but whose capacity to find trouble is not,black_comedy
the first thing that struck me about o brother where art thou was the locations the coen brothers did a stellar job of portraying the mississippi of this time period as i have always imagined it would look it makes me want to seek out these parts of my state myself just to see what true rural mississippi once looked likethe second thing that caught my attention about this movie is how overthetop it is that will automatically make it unpleasant for some but it became endearing for me after only a short time yes george clooneys accent doesnt work nearly as well as john turturros or tim blake nelsons but after a while it all seems to fit and just seems rightthe third element that stands out about o brother is the songs awesome every scene is highlighted by some of the most kickass oldtimey tunes known to man anyone who doesnt want the soundtrack after seeing the movie is just being contrary the fact that this is loosely based on the odyssey is only occasionally apparent but the story that is here is more than enough to entertain every new character is captivating no matter how long or brief their screen time the movies starts off brilliantly sags a bit toward the middle and then finishes fairly strong its not quite consistent enough to be a classic but i definitely would like to see it again just a lot of fun to watch,black_comedy
the depressionera deep south comes alive like mythological ancient greece in joel and ethan coens o brother where art thou an adaptation of homers odyssey the coen brothers came to the realization that the folklore of the deep south is the heart of american myth and tales of long journeys and they marry homers epic to this aesthetic in a way that respects the original story and american folklore while imbuing them with a semisilly tonethe 1930s mississippi setting also makes a difference postcivil war and precivil rights the south is caught between past traditions and forces of change and the american dream feels well out of reach yet not impossibly beyond grasping the trio of escaped chaingang convicts ulysses everett mcgill george clooney pete john turturro and delmar tim blake nelson are in search of more than a million dollars that everett has hidden back home money that will change their lives their long journey takes varying episodic twists and turns as they encounter all manner of characters good and evilthe heart and soul of the film however is its music folks songs hymns spirituals and more have both a pivotal role in the film in terms of plot in addition to providing the mythical tone songs are often tied to strange turns of events in the story such as three mysterious women singing along the river and enchanting the runaways obvious parallel to the odyssey the gang even picks up tommy johnson chris thomas king who went down to the crossroads and sold his soul to the devil to play guitar the very legend that started blues musicthe films arrangement i am a man of constant sorrow the song that the trio plus johnson sing into a can for 10 under the pseudonym the soggy bottom boys when they come across a blind radio producer stephen root proves strangely key to the story and is unbelievably catchy to boot music in the film as it so often did in the south brings people together and makes a difference the coens film has as much to say about that notion as it does anything elsethe coens irreverent silly but whipsmart humor also pervades o brother where art thou the dynamic of the loquacious and self absorbed everett along with hotheaded pete and the clueless optimist delmar has endless appeal even when its clear early on that its not a healthy one the oddball characters along the way especially george dont call him babyface nelson michael badalucco john goodmans big dan teague and rival politicians pappy odaniel charles durning and homer stokes wayne duvall provide a similarly intriguging effect to the many creatures odysseus and crew meet in their travelso brother stands testament to the power of american folklore that even for a country barely 200 years old theres a certain magic in it that the coen brothers tap into with the appropriate use of magical realism and narrative technique that resembles greek mythology its concept and music may be more exciting than its plot but a special film to behold of a genre all its ownsteven cthanks for reading visit movie muse reviews for more,black_comedy
while stated at the very beginning that this movie is based on homers odyssey i feel that the coen brothers really take their freedom and gives a loose interpretation of the extant the story feels like its not a complete version of the odyssey rather a collection of snippets of the more significant incidents the characters and backgrounds are also getting reinterpreted wildly must i say yet those interpretations get to be very funny and entertaining i really enjoy the interpretation about the cyclops and the sirens the mood gets to be formed very nicely with the coherent choices of lighting and coloration the acting in overall looks also good george clooney takes most of the credit for it but john turturro did also quite good especially on their face expressions,black_comedy
the coen brothers present a reasonably entertaining comedy very loosely based on homers odyssey the hero of this films journey is everett whose first name is actually ulysses and whose story parallels that of homers hero but everetts story is very much unique the coens take a rough outline from homer and then make the story all their own the story unfolds in rural mississippi in 1937 a unique and as we will come to see rather strange place everett is an escaped convict who has two companions on his journey pete and delmar were chained to everett at the time of his escape he convinced them to go along with him by filling their heads with a story of buried treasure they lose the chains will they find the treasure the first person they stumble upon after their escape tells them they will find a fortune but not the one they seek interesting what will fate have in store for our trio at the end of their arduous journey this is a comedy film which has its funny moments but the film is rather uneven the laughs dont come as consistently as you would like it is music more than comedy which really sparks the film to life everett pete and delmar end up unwitting radio stars the soggy bottom boys their hit song man of constant sorrow is a treat the film has a good lively mix of folk and bluegrass music throughout so the music is fun the story doesnt quite match the music though there are times where things move a little too slowly times where things get a little too weird at one point delmar is convinced pete has been turned into a toad yes weird indeed delmar is a bit of a dim bulb pete isnt much brighter everett is the brains of the operation but while hes got a quick wit hes surely no genius either there are times when the dimness of the trio is endearing but there are times where it wears thin tooeverett pete and delmar are certainly the focus of the story but they meet plenty of interesting characters on their homerinspired journey and keeping with the offbeat theme of the entire film many of these characters are exceedingly odd this really is a strange film but the coens pull it all together reasonably well george clooney playing everett is a good star to build around clooney brings real personality to the role john turturro as pete and tim blake nelson as delmar complement clooney well there may be times the story drags times where the comedy misses the mark but it is not the fault of the performers everyone suits their role very well john goodman and holly hunter are among those who pop into the film portraying characters who take the story in some surprising directions it seems a simple story that of everett and friends on an ordinary journey but there is nothing ordinary about the world of this film the coens have populated this world with some supremely strange people and that makes for a decent bit of fun maybe the film doesnt always work as well as it should but it perks up enough here and there to keep you interested and entertained things get a little bizarre at times but there is some fun in that too and the music keeps things lively youll be clamoring for more of the soggy bottom boys this is certainly not the greatest comedy the coens ever produced but its good enough to satisfy,black_comedy
a fine comedy  road movie by the coens i never read homers oddyssey but it seems one can do without when watching this as per usual in a coens comedy there are lots of striking over the top characters here and i like them a whole lot better than the ones in the hudsucker proxy the leading trio reminds me of laurel and hardy especially tim blake nelson looks and acts like the spitting image of stan laurel at timesthe story is more like a series of events although towards the end things are quite neatly tied together as with some other coen films this time around it didnt speak to me as much as it once did but its still highly enjoyable which also had much to do with the loads of fantastic old country and blues music and the terrific cinematographic atmosphere of that ol american southa good 8 out of 10,black_comedy
im rather young and havent seen as much films as other film buffs out there but i cant help but to think that this is one of the best films ive seen i first watched this back in 2010 or 2011 and o brother where art thou still doesnt get old to me for starters they couldnt have chosen a better cast its hard to believe how amazing george clooneys acting was on top of that the storyline is phenomenal how they were able to take an old story the odyssey one of my favorite homer stories and weave it into a southern tale is seriously amazing its very believablethe soundtrack is one of the best music scores ive heard im very hard to impress with folk or country music mainly because im not exactly into the genre but i can say that i was very impressed with the soundtrack and thought it couldnt be any better or worseif youve never watched this film and are only reading reviews before thinking about watching it stop reading now and watch the film already you will not regret it in fact youll thank most of us for writing about how great the film is,black_comedy
i just saw this very good movie for the first time i was inspired to watch it because in the reviews of my favorite new movie blue ruin there were several comparisons to the coen brothers movies everetts wife in o brother tells his kids that he was hit by a train in blue ruin when ben first sees dwight he tells him a guy someone i guess they had both known got hit by a train its the best comic line in the movie in my opinion i would love to know if it was actually an homage to the coen brothers jeremy saulnier the blue ruin creator and macon blair his friend and the star in blue ruin strike me as being very subtle and intelligent and i would be surprised if the train reference wasnt their way of honoring the coens,black_comedy

as a big fan of the coens ive always said that their comedies dont do much for me as their dramas well in this case their films that are more drama than comedy this may be the exception though its probably the first of their comedies that i really love the whole cast is fantastic turturro is once again mvp he can do so much with his expressions so talented what has to be noted here is the incredible music cant wait to hear the soundtrack by itself the film keeps on surprising throughout its quite funny but also quite pleasurable its truly amazing just how much range the coens have and how much they can do with such complex ideas,black_comedy
o brother where art though is my second favorite coen brothers film its also the first one ive seen well this is the premise ulysses everett mcgill george clooney has just escaped prison with two cell mates pete hogwallop john tuturro and delmar odonnell tim blake nelson ulysses tells pete and delmar that they have escaped to go find a fortune but its really so ulysses can get back together with his wife holly hunter who divorced him when he was sent to jail along the way they meet all kinds of characters they meet tommy johnson chris thomas king a guitarist who sold his soul to the devil george baby face nelson michael badalucco a high strung prohibition gangster and daniel big dan teague john goodman a one eyed bible salesman who is secretly a ku klux klan member they are being chased by a sheriff daniel von bargen who loses them at every turn eventually they make it to ulysses wife who demands her ring back when they go get it they are caught by the police but then a massive flood comes in and sweeps them away i love this movie its funny engaging and of course has that coen feel to it clooney makes a really good main character so check it out,black_comedy
i watched this movie again after a long time and man what a movie i thought this was george clooneys best movie hes ever acted in with michael clayton a close second the trio of guys fit perfectly and the rest of the cast was tailormade for this type of movie the score was fantastic as well by t boone pickens the digital color correction which is also used in the recent tv series true detectve is something im a big fan of you really felt like you were in the deep south experiencing that era of life i wish these kinds of movies came out more often its sad that these types of movies arent typically guaranteed to make a lot of money in todays age the world of cgi combined with action commercially is selling like wildfire while our overall desire for wellscripted and acted movies is diminishing thank goodness people like ron howard scorsesse coens paul thomas anderson and few others arent necessarily scoring for commercial success,black_comedy
this was kind of a quirky almost whimsical take on odyssey these three guys are on a chain gang and escape so they decide the make their way home sort of and have weird adventures along the way thy meet cyclops and sirens like odyssey or at least a weird more modernized version of it well its actually set in the 30s george clooney john turturro and john goodman who represents the cyclops in odyssey are great in it as well as holly hunter who walks around say her new beau is bonafied its funny how george clooney has to load a ton of this specific hair cream into his hair i also love the soggy bottom boys song man of constant sorrow its very catchy,black_comedy

arguably the best coen brothers film ever and thats saying a lot this work of genius would be in my top 10 great movie comedies of all time if i had such a list the script is brilliant as is the story then add the offthecharts performances of so many topnotch actors starting of course with george clooney who puts in a bravura performance that brings to mind the brilliance of a cary grant john turturro who was never better and never more endearing stealing many scenes in fact as the backwoods pete hogwallop and tim blake nelson as the lovable but terminally dumb delmar odonnellbut then there are the exceptional performances of so many great character actors its almost impossible to give everyone credit charles durning puts in perhaps his funniest comic performance ever you have got to see him dancing as gov pappy odaniel john goodmanwhat a performance he delivers as big dan teague you have to see this film just to see the incredible job goodman does here one of his best roles ever even vignetteplayer and fine character actor stephen root impresses as a blind radio station guy  what an imagination he creates one of the most memorable comic characters youll ever see in a movie he leaves an indelible impression one of the highest points of a film with many high points he will have you in stitches im not a fan of holly hunter usually but here even she puts in a brilliant performance as clooneys quirky and quixotic wife ray mckinnon as vernon t waldrip and frank collison as wash hogwallop  both bit parts  shine brightly as well the musics incredible too  i had to buy both the dvd of the movie and the cd of the score the music was so endearing this movie sizzles on every level and the cast and crew all were on the top energy level in synch and with a chemistry rarely seen in film cant top this and by the way  if you like this film by the way  try to see preston sturges great classic sullivans travels upon which this movie was in part based,black_comedy
i definitely loved this film its just as perfect as a film can get some can say that this is not a real coen film but who cares when a film is good as this one everything is just flawless the plot is way lighthearted for a coen film its really the kind of film that follows the arc the protagonist suffersuffer and in the end he met happiness similar arc with the odissey of homer whose book was used here as the mainly inspiration for the film obviously the name of the protagonist is indeed the same in both o brother where are thou and in the odissey ulyssesthe acting in almost all the coens films are phenomenal and over the top and this repeat itself here in this film great job by turturro and clooney which held the lead of the film and did very well the cinematography by roger adkins and as well the art design are essential to build the dread and sunset ambient of the south really deserved oscar nomination for itand how to not talk about the fantastic music in the film it really left speechless music in the film was originally conceived as a major component of the film not merely as a background or a support noted producer and musician t bone burnett worked with the coens while the script was still in its working phases and the soundtrack was recorded before filming commencedthe soggy bottom boys singing man of constant sorrowmuch of the music used in the film is periodspecific folk music including that of virginia bluegrass singer ralph stanley the musical selection also includes religious music including primitive baptist and traditional africanamerican gospel most notably the fairfield four an a cappella quartet with a career extending back to 1921 who appear in the soundtrack and as gravediggers towards the films end selected songs in the film reflect the possible spectrum of musical styles typical of the old culture of the american south gospel delta blues country swing and bluegrass there is a notable use of dirges and other macabre songs a theme that often recurs in appalachian music o death lonesome valley angel band i am weary in contrast to bright cheerful songs keep on the sunnyside in the highways in other parts of the filmthe voices of the soggy bottom boys were provided by dan tyminski lead vocal on man of constant sorrow nashville songwriter harley allen and the nashville bluegrass bands pat enright the three won a cma award for single of the year and a grammy award for best country collaboration with vocals both for the song man of constant sorrow tim blake nelson sang the lead vocal on in the jailhouse nowman of constant sorrow has five variations two are used in the film one in the music video and two in the soundtrack two of the variations feature the verses being sung backtoback and the other three variations feature additional music between each verse though the song received little significant radio airplay it reached 35 on the us billboard hot country singles  tracks chart in 2002 the version of ill fly away heard in the film is performed not by krauss and welch as it is on the cd and concert tour but by the kossoy sisters with erik darling accompanying on longneck 5string banjo recorded in 1956 for the album bowling green on tradition recordstommy the lead guitarist of the soggy bottom boys is an intentional reference to the legend of delta blues artist tommy johnson who claimed to have sold his soul to the devil in return for blues fameso what you are expecting go watch it now 9610,black_comedy

it is likely that most often i will write reviews about the movies of coen brothers in a movie showing from well known to painfully well known themes they succeeded to show their coenism as a perfect cinema culinary the brothers powdered the main dish with the flavor of the collision of science and religion the ignorance and faith destiny and the personal choice and in a what way in moments grotesque ironic and satiric with the wonderful play of george clooney the main characters like odysseus and the bremen musicians led on the story line of candid of voltaire are involved in adventureon the background of the individual lamentations for wealth and power the heroic ensemble is being caught in the trap of the state laws and gods will who is authorized to judge the providence attach to them colorful adherents which draw them into the stream of their personality acts for final the garnish is bittersweet and hardbakedlove the woman of the main hero appear and she is capable of everything it seem like it is written for them to be together until she counts to three the eternal motor is being found and the motive of the history is not reason there is only one explanationit will be good if there were more of these movies the sight which coen brothers have is unique and can be put to a row of similar themes and plots we hope there will be more of their movies but until we hope  watch this onehttpvihrenmitevmoviesblogspotcom,black_comedy
its a story about a man whos wife wont be with him until he figures out a way to make money he goes on a journey and encounters characters symbolic of different paths to take to fortune starting with the police  they exploit the poorest and most desperate of peoplethen they encounter religion  you can make a couple bucks off everyone the farmer  everyones got to eat the guitarist musician  people like music the broadcaster  exploits the musicians the politician  basically just makes a living off telling others what they can and cant dothe thief babyface  they steal stuff obviously the sirens ladies in the lake  they seduce people the violent liar big dan  manipulates then takes by force the social club kkk  they basically work off each otheralso racistswhich is really just a way of eliminating competition in the workplacehis epiphany is when he sings at the town hall realizes that hes actually pretty damn good at music and making people happy through art immediately after performing the politician starts trying to make money off the attention they getalso hilariously makes them sing a song he likes just like real lifeanyways he goes on this magnificent journey finds out what his skill set is then returns home to his wife and kids having figured out how to provide for them musicians made money back then i suppose the depression was a good setting for the movie considering how difficult it was to make a living at the time,black_comedy
being a man who didnt enjoy no country for old men i was quite skeptical watching this movie to my pleasant surprise obwat became one of the few films that were much better than anticipatedthe coen brothers did a good job on the story and scenario while the subtle humour was without a doubt the best choice the performance of the three protagonists was amazing with clooney and nelson offering many hilarious moments the music playing a significant role in the plot was really enjoyableperhaps the only disadvantage is that the action began too early even though a longer duration could make the movie boring what is more the ending doesnt sticks with the rest of the filmi believe this film can appeal to any kind of cinephile and this makes it a great comedy,black_comedy
o brother where art thou was one film which had been intriguing me ever since id heard about it and its storyline immediately caught my fancy a comedy road movie about three escaped convicts who go in search of a missing treasure in the rural heartlands of 1937 mississippi and how they end up becoming one of the states most loved folk bands i am told that it is inspired from homers epic ballad the odyssey and the film recognizes this inspiration in its opening credits but since ive never read the odyssey i cannot comment as to whether the film stays true to it or not but i can tell you that it is a beautiful comedy a genre which the coen brothers have dabbled in lately with movies such as the ladykillers and burn after reading unfortunately their comedies are the only films i could relate to i never really understood barton fink or the big lebowski maybe they have many complex political and social undertones which are not perceptible to a first time viewerin o brother george clooney stars as ulysses everett mcgill a prisoner in a chain gang who convinces his fellow inmates pete hogwallop turturro and delmar nelson to come with him in search of a treasure buried somewhere in the heart of mississippi this starts off a long road journey where they meet a black guitarist who claims he has sold his soul to the devil and they embark on a series of comic adventures which include performing a single at a radio station calling themselves the soggy bottom boys getting themselves swindled by an insurance salesman disrupting a meeting of the ku klux klan of which the governorelect is a member among other incidents the film takes an extremely light hearted outlook on the depressing lives these people led and how they pulled on without any form of economic security whatsoever george clooneys performance as the charming allknowing everett with a crazy obsession for neatly parted hair is wonderful and to me invited comparisons to his character in leatherheads which is also set around the same time everett is the kind of character clooney could play in his sleep and i sense that he enjoyed the role immensely john turturro as the everangry pete hogwallop is also a treat to watch and tim blake nelson as delmar the dunce is pleasing but i guess the real star of the film is its music a wonderful soundtrack consisting of several american folk songs of the time aptly complements the storytelling style of the film most notable among these are the man of constant sorrow which is sung by the main characters in the film and harry mcclintocks the big rock candy mountains which appears at the beginning of the film and has now become one of my personal favourites the tune and lyrics fit into the mood of the movie brilliantly and are part of the reason why its such an enjoyable watch there is an almost constant background score throughout the film and this gives you an impression of a magical land where everything was perfect and everyone was happy far from what was actually happening at the time but somehow the situations dont seem all that unrealistic and you end up loving the characters all the more you just want to keep singing that song again and again until you watch the movie once more,black_comedy
warning this review contains spoilers about the ending of this moviei watched this film again last night on bluray it still amazes mei was first introduced to this excellent movie through the soundtrack album which i loved but than i watched the film it is now one of my favorite coen films though that isnt a fair comparison as i have only seen this true grit and raising arizona the performances are classic especially george clooney as the slick protagonist everett obsessed with dapper dan hair grease and his wife penny damn were in a tight spot is my favorite quote tim blake nelson also deserves praise for his portrayal as delmar blake nelson portrays an idiot very well and the coens script gives him the best lines of the movie this is my favorite well ill only be 82 the beautiful photography by roger deakins who also helped ilm on the beautiful animation for rango captures the feel of 1937 mississippi perfectly with his digitally colored shots they fit so well with the story that they are inseparable it is a great hoot watching this eclectic assortment of the odyssey country music southern folklore and great humorthe most perfect part of this film is the ending the flooding of the valley with the harmonies of the fairfield four would be good enough but the details makes into a great piece of arta sea of dapper dan cans the drowning hound and the happy little tire swing the cow on the cotton house clooneys monologue about the new south rolltop desk holly hunters linethis isnt my ring the kids on the twine leash and the blind prophet on a handcar singing angel band as he rides away into the distance movie history,black_comedy
i am usually put into a state of sorrow by most films i see as i think at this stage it could be a lost art or perhaps i just need a new dvd collection never fearcry the cohen brothers as they more than renew my love of film and affirm to me it still is a very powerful toolfilms should capture something should make you think make you laugh  make you cry they should be so seamlessly made you forget there might be a set somewhere the careful alchemy of the cohens proves they still know thisthoroughly enjoyable filmgenuinely funny and truly american to take the idea of homers ye old grecian tale wrap it up in old time music and cinematography so greathmm i have spun out all the reasons why one should watch this movie to anyone whose ever askedso let me give the highest commendation i can its a damn good filmit is a masterpiece of storytelling and technical proficiency it is the only film out of maybe 4 5 others i felt necessary to buy after its cinema run was overand ladies the score is orgasmic so forget the rabbit and watch this instead,black_comedy
o brother where art thou 2000 is a movie about three guys on a chain gang that escape everett mcgill played by george clooney convinces the two guys he is chained with pete played by john turturro and del mar played by tim blake nelson to escape with him everett deceived the pair by telling them that he had money buried from a heist that he would share with themthe trio meets up with a blind man that tells them the treasure they seek may not be the treasure they find there are many obstacles that the trio must face on their journey big dan played by john goodman beats them up and leaves them for dead the trio narrowly escapes the kkk and even petes cousin wash tries to turn them in for a reward while all the time they are being pursued by sheriff cooley the theme of the movie is about being flexible along lifes road when on a path to a certain destination remain open to other roads that may lead to success this is conveyed by the blind man the trio meets as the story unfolds the trio becomes successful when they meet up with tommy and decide to record a song with him little do they know that this will be what makes them rich and gets them pardoned by the governor this is exactly what the blind mans prediction was conveying the use of sound when the trio hops the train conveys the successful escape the scene where the trio watches the blind man move down the track gives the audience a chance to contemplate the words he spoke to them another element that led to the movies success was the soundtrack it was on the top selling list for years after the movies release the time period is conveyed by the colors in the movie the other effective element is the way the characters talk with the mississippi drawl every time i see this movie i am reminded of butch cassidy and the sun dance kid the two very different groups are trying to escape criminal charges but neither group really appears to be criminals of their own choosing i think each group is a victim of desperate times they are trying to survive destitution it was a funny movie with many twists and turns that teach life lessons the trio was always on the move experiencing many of lifes surprises the last disaster the trio faces is what keeps them safe i think the storyline conveys the desperate times back in the years following the great depression according to imdb there was an inaccuracy the boy with the gun says he shot at a census taker but the census is only taken in tenth years ie 1930 or 1940,black_comedy
the coen brothers have done a wonderful job combining both modern activities and references to the biblical times in the movie i feel the theme also is referring to how political campaigning was done in the south with oldtime music in the film three escape convicts george clooney as ulysses everett mcgill john turturro as peter hogwallop and tim nelson as delmar odonnell set out to retrieve a 12 million treasure that ulysses claims to have stolen before he was convicted they have four days to reach the treasure before the valley is flooded to provide a lake as part of the new hydroelectric project when they begin their journey they encounter a blind man on a manual railroad car that tells them what they will encounter through their journey their first stop is at petes cousins house that helps free them from their chains and provides them with clothing and ulysses with his hair product dapper dan wash hogwallop needs the money so he turns them in to the police but his son saves them from sheriff cooley by driving into the burning barn and retrieving the three convicts to their freedom yet again later while in the woods both pete and delmar are saved continuing on their journey they met tommy johnson chris king a young man that has just sold his soul to the devil in order to play the guitar tommy is headed to a radio station that pays 10 dollars to record songs needing money the three convicts claim they are the soggy bottom boys and record a song that becomes a hit around the state while watching a film in the cinema everett and delmar learn that pete had not been turned into a toad by the sirens but was turned in to the police for the bounty everett and delmar rescue pete from jail and everett reveals that there is no treasure he made it up to get to his wife holly hunter that is about to be married to another manray mckinnon now convincing the three to help get his wife back they are disguised a musicians to get close to penny holly hunter to show her he is a bona fide and he would not let her go after convincing her that he is her true love and bona fide the groups sets out to retrieve the ring that was in their old house they again meet up with the sheriff that is about to hang them when the flood comes to fill the valley they get the ring but it is the wrong one and cannot get her wedding ring since it is at the bottom of the lake the movie set in the 30s during the great depression and has many similarities to homers film the odyssey such as the first lines of the odyssey and the text of o brother where art thou the names of the people and the biblical references show how the movies are both themed with the faith and skepticism some of the techniques that are used are the lighting and angles the coen brothers wanted the movie to resemble the effects of and old picture but to have the light intensify by the natural skintones and golden sunsets old but new with this effect they used digital mastering to dull the image of the entire film when using different angles with the camera they have creating a sense of drama and at the same time hiding detailso brother where art thou theme is show throughout the entire film in which a number of biblical ideas are referenced and used to show the struggle between faith and skepticism,black_comedy
the film starts out with three men everett pete and delmar everett is played by george cloony pete is played by john tuturro and delmar is played by tim blake nelson the three men are in prison together and shackled at the foot and everett comes up with this wonderful idea that he has a hidden treasure and the three of them should break out of prison and find it so that is what they did the three of them overcome many obstacles while in search for the treasure pete and delmar then realize there was no treasure it is strictly everett trying to prevent his exwife from becoming eloped again the theme of the movie is very comical and it keeps you laughing the entire time everett pete and delmar learn a lot throughout the obstacle the first thing they encounter on their voyage was a blind man which tells them their future while receiving a ride from him the future that he comes up with for the men is that they are going to find a treasure but it isnt going to be the treasure that they are intending to find the men end up sleeping in a barn and the authorities that are trying to find the men find out about it so they set the barn that they are sleeping in on fire the men then go running through the woods and they cite a baptism without truly knowing much about it they get in line and receive the father ghost and the holy spirit the men come across a radio station where they get on the radio as the soggy bottom boys but they arent about to sign their names so they just write xs they dont want the authorities to be able to hunt them down the men also get involved in a bank robbery with baby face nelson which has completed robberies several times everett and delmar believe that pete has been turned into a frog and they later find out that he was caught pete and delmar find out that everett was lying to them about the treasure he was just trying to get his exwife back before she got remarried but when they arrived to penny she was interested in having everett back and she told their kids that he was dead because she was ashamed about what everett did in the end everett got his way and got penny back the movie was very well put together and it was a lot like the odyssey the movie made you feel like you were actually in the great depression due to the lighting and they well put together scenes,black_comedy
the plot of this film features george clooney as everett mcgill pursuing and ambitious goal everett and two of his counterparts pete john tuturro and delmar tim blake nelson escape from prison and embark on a false mission of finding a treasure their mission in actuality is everetts selfish desire to keep his exwife from marrying someone else their adventure leads them into very troubling and dangerous scenarios all the while the three are pursued by a tenacious law dog sherriff cooley who catches up with the defying trio on a few occasionsmuch akin to the theme of the breakfast club the apparent theme of this film centers on numerous characters learning hard lessons of life and watching the changing of morality amongst the people they run into one good example of this theme is when big dan teeg john goodman begins an exuberant sales pitch to everett and convinces two of them to join him on a pick nick luncheon while enjoying the pleasantries of the lunch setting he attacks both of them and takes their money another clear example of this theme is when the trio runs into the sirens washing their clothing in the river bed the ignorance of the three of them leads them into a trap and causes one to be turned into the authorities they awake stunned and perplexed as to what happenedthe lighting and color techniques of the movie really add to the realism of the dust bowl era that the film is set during this adds to the challenge portrayed by the characters during their several scenarios of conflict a prevalent motif or symbolic repetition that occurs throughout the course of the film is represented by the character obstacles of big dan the sheriff and the ku klux klan leader at each point that the characters seem to make progress on their mission or rather everetts mission these symbolic obstacles are placed in their paths which sets them onto the next scene with some knowledge obtainedthis film is a must see and keeps you involved in the mood and setting there is plenty of portrayal of comic relief wit and other emotion to keep you interested the trio definitely offers a bit of education on some hard lessons of life,black_comedy
well the coen brothers made another interesting film to add to their directing repertoire this is somewhat more mainstream then their previous films but thats not saying much this film still has the delightful quirky feeling that their movies seem to feature despite some preachiness and a weird music score to this film i really had to like a film like thisthis film is about three prisoners who escape and they go on an odyssey like adventure to reclaim treasure before the wealth gets flooded awaygeorge clooney is one heck of an actor he chooses his roles very wiselyother than batman and robin of course and thats why the academy loves him so much the rest of the cast led by turturro and blake nelson were superboverall this movie feels like a cross between the three stooges and the odyssey there are some adventures here that feature sirens and cyclops figuratively speaking and a trio of unintelligent delinquents but this a very fun coens movie albeit a little more mainstream i rate this film 910,black_comedy
based on homers the odyssey a chain gang led by ulysses everett mcgill is led on a journey in search of false treasure this treasure was made up by ulysses in order to motivate his bound friends to escape the film takes place in mississippi during the 1930s on their journey they encounter many unexpected people ulysses played by george clooney and his friends pete and delmar wind up in situations involving unique characters who reflect roles in the odyssey an example of one of the more interesting character references was the sheriff played by daniel von bargen he could have been meant to portray hades the ruler of the underworld or poseidonthe theme is basically about a mans journey home while on his journey the sheriff constantly chases him and he encounters many speed bumps on the way some of these bumps include big dan played by john goodman meant to portray polyphemus the cyclops and the ladies in the river meant to portray the sirens who try to seduce ulysses and his friends this film is closely tied to another film directed by preston sturges o brother where art thou and sullivans travels have a lot of parallel thematic elements the two films even share some very similar plot parallels the whole idea of the journey home and the hero overcoming his pride were evident in both films some examples of the plot similarities were the train scene the film viewing by the prisoners someone using violence to quench their thirst for greed and the rambunctious driving scenes of the two young boys the digital editing done in the film was a good way to make it seem as if it took place in the 1930s the editing of the color into a sepia tone really created a southern old time feel the computergenerated cattle were also another good technique used this just helped the film look more authentic during the scenes where the cattle were included,black_comedy
a retelling of the odyssey by homer directed by joel coenthe film main actors are george clooneyjohn turturro and tim blake nelson my favorite scene of the film was when everettpete and delmar sang the man of constant sorrow for the radio station the acting in the film was great by everyone involved in the film george clooney was the highlight in the film and he was very convincing in his role as everret mcgill the story was very interesting and had a few twists that were not expectedte movie is one of my favorite movies ever made and it was really entertaining throughout the 107 minute runtime,black_comedy
this is actually one of my favorite clooney films ysee theres these three soggy guys by the names of everett clooney pete turturro and delmar tim blake nelson who escape from a chain gang and embark on a journey acrost the state of mississippi in the depression era 1930s loosely following homers odyssey they jump from one frying pan into the next fire and over again they get lost get saved a marvelous baptism scene and manage to squeeze themselves into the strangest musical renditions and dance sequences imaginable clooney gives a classic performance as a character i can best describe as the humanized version of foghorn leghorn a knowitall who loves to hear himself speak then theres pete played by john turturro whos a grumpy guy along for the ride at the bottom of this food chain gang is delmar played by tim blake nelson ole delmar is a simple fellow with a good heart whos trying to keep a clean spirit in leu of the events these characters become involved in woven into this deep south motif are a black blues singer who sold his soul to the devil two shady candidates for the guvnas office and a one eyed bible salesman played by john goodman theres so many things to notice in this film theres a looney tunes quality but also a very realistic quality portraying the depression era politics and poverty to a t theres also a three stooges quality and the at the same time a very preston sturgess humanist thing its the perfect balance for me but quite possibly the coolest thing about this film is the music topping off that old timey look the film has its awesome bluegrass delta blues and gospel music and its a character of its own in the film long live the coens,black_comedy
brother where art thou is taken from preston sturges world war 2 era comedy sullivans travels in which a movie director sets out to chronicle the misery of the depression instead he decides that people in the country need to have something to laugh at the coen brothers use sturges style in a prison escape comedy with george clooney leading the way ulyssesclooney has been informed by a cell mate that he has buried over one million dollars and that it will be underwater due to a project creating a man made lake in four days time the escaping convicts meet hobos on the railways and encounter a christian revival and are baptized along the way further adventures include a run in with th ku klux klan and a man with a radio station recording christian music the accompanying soundtrack is awesome and the coen brother have made a lasting tribute to preston sturges,black_comedy
i get just the biggest kick out of this picture so much so that i regularly listen to the films soundtrack and have been inspired to memorize the words to the big rock candy mountain that song singularly captures the whimsical nature of the picture and prefaces the adventurous escapades of our hero trio  in the big rock candy mountain all the jails are made of tin and you can walk right out again as soon as you are in not being a fan of george clooney i thought he did an exceptional job here as the nominal leader of the chain gang misfits that make a break for it on the road to fame and fortune its only later that we come to realize that everetts quest is really to reunite with his wife and kids and dispel the notion that he was hit by a train clooneys given all the best lines by virtue of his good looks and snappy delivery and his dumber than a bag of hammers line is one im apt to use from time to time myselfso everyone knows by now that the story is based on homers odyssey but i havent heard anyone yet make a connection to one of my favorite childhood films remember when everett pete john turturro and delmar tim blake nelson pop up over the hedge and join the procession at the klan rally wasnt it oddly reminiscent of the wizard of oz the only thing missing was delmar trying to tuck a tail underneath his robe and say didnt pete look a lot like the scarecrow to sum it up  good story cool characters witty dialog and a great musical score make this a favorite of mine and probably the first coen brothers film to get my attention enough to seek out their other pictures this one though is the one ill keep coming back to watch again and again its that entertaining,black_comedy
maybe the perfect adventure film this instant coen classic is impossible to turn away from though it makes no mistake about its influences  an early title card immediately identifies the picture as an adaptation of homers odyssey  the brilliance of o brother is in its departures from the source material which come so frequently that the carryovers the sirens the cyclops the protagonists escape from captivity are celebrated as nods and winks expected but also unexpected george clooney john turturro and tim blake nelson are perfectly cast as the charismatically brainless scoundrels at the storys epicenter while guest spots from john goodman holly hunter and charles durning take the whole mess over the top amazingly rich sharpwitted engrossing stuff thats accompanied by an alltime favorite of a soundtrack,black_comedy
the coen brothers follow up their two last crime black comedies with a more lighthearted piece the risk pays off the film is silly and full of eccentric characters the film is also more period oriented than any other coen film it is full of convincing sets and a good amount of extras roger deakins fantastic cinematography is a highlight using color lenses for dramatic and comedic effect was one of the smartest decisions the coens made with this one clooney along with his two costars dominate every scene even when the dialogue is a bit on the uncredible side still a knockout though with lots of laughs and always entertainment value,black_comedy
o brother where art thou this movie is a comedy with a strange plot the movie has household name actors playing very weird roles the theme in this movie is one of an ill advised adventure which ends in disaster the movie is set in the deep south during the 1930s the depression is in full swing and the scenes of the movie depict a desperate time in american historythere are three stars in this movie george clooney everett john turturro pete and tim blake nelson delmar the movie centers around these three escape convicts who are the search for a hidden treasure these hapless characters find adventure in many different ways such as a seductive episode at a river bed a short lived radio broadcasting career and an unbelievable ending to the wacky adventure although these adventures are side tracks to the real plot of finding the treasure that everett so desperately wants to steala few of the cinematic elements are music and editing the music relates to the popular song the trio sang man of constant sorrow they assumed the stage name of the soggy bottom boys in the movie this was a hit but also in real life this song was played all over the radio i wonder if it was more of a joke than actual talent but none the less it was entertaining the second cinematic element that makes the movie a success is the editing there are scenes in the movie where the scene cuts away and when it returns it leaves some question as to what actually happened this is most evident in the sirens scene by the riverthe movie is accidentally based off the story by homer the odyssey i have read many reports that the writers did not intend it to resemble the odyssey the similarities are vague and were changed enough to not be an exact copy of the odyssey however one cannot deny that the subtle changes in the movie resembles homers classic tale i am sure that is homer was alive he would have been thrilled that his story became a hollywood spectaclein conclusion i think that this is a top notch movie to watch the adventure for the trio is surely ill advised but considering their alternative it seemed like a good idea it has comedy that will make you laugh action to make your heart race and an ending that is unpredictable,black_comedy
like many aspects of the movie o brother where art thou the title is an allusion of an allusion the coen brothers themselves have been quoted as saying that the title references the fictional book of the same name in preston sturges 1941 film sullivans travels in this earlier movie john sullivan a movie producer is on a search for a better movie based on the adaptation of the fictional book o brother where art thou this title is itself an allusion to the novels of steinbeck and ultimately even to the story of cain and abel in the book of genesis in the coens movie o brother where art thou the characters are on a search for literal treasure in neither of these movies do the characters find what they are looking for the viewer too may not find precisely what they are looking for indeed if one expected to find a story as fine as gullivers travels or one whose moral is as universal as the story of caine and abel sullivans travels would fall short as would any viewer be disappointed if they expected the movie o brother where art thou to be as the character john sullivan would a serious movie that about the plight of the downtrodden following the trail of these allusions places the viewer too on kind of treasure hunt never ultimately finding what we are looking forthe most overt allusion that the movie draws from the odyssey seems conversely to give the viewer the most treasure odysseus is there in the veil of everett ulysses mcgill as are his shipmates and family the angry gods make appearances as do the sirens the cyclops and many more however the quality and scope of these characters seems to have degenerated throughout the ages instead of odysseus ulysses in latin the great king overcoming great woes to guide his men home and return to his loving family we are presented with everett a twobit con man who fools his men into helping him return to his estranged family the family too seems degenerate odysseus wife is utterly faithful and goes to all length to fight off her suitors his son is a brave prince who tries everything to find his father everetts wife penny on the other hand is ashamed of her estranged husband she lies to her daughters and tells them that everett has been hit by a train and plans to marry her suitor after seeing her everett even calls her a succubus the coens seem to have gone out of their way to deprive the characters of o brother where art thou of any vestige of the heroism and greatness that their forebears once possessed a oneeyed bible salesman has replaced the great cyclops the sirens are now just highway robbers and ancient greece has become 1930s mississippi even the comic narrative of o brother where art thou proves inferior in quality to that of the epic odyssey in framing their degenerate narrative in such sharp contrast to the heroic odyssey the coens do more than invite comparison they have reformed the odyssey and emerged with something poignantly less in doing so they seem to hint at the fact that reform is not synonymous with progressthis idea is one that recurs again and again in the movie but never as noticeably as in the sidestory of pappy odaniel pappy is the governor of mississippi pappy is shown to be a fat autocrat however his opponent homor stokes the reform candidate is shown to be much worse he is in fact the leader of the kkk we even find out that the nature of homers political reform is to combat racial integration in mississippi again we see the idea of reform leading to a reversal of progressone notable exception to this idea comes in the form of radio no doubt the radio represents a reformation of technology and yet it also is a positive image in this movie everett and his men are helped in a way that odysseus could not be by the power of mass communication the suggy bottom boys are first made famous by their songs on the radio and then later use radio to vanquish homor stokes no doubt radio is a prime example of how reformation can be positive o brother where art thou does not seem to present the idea of reform as strictly positive or negative instead we are offered a different image that of manic depression this notion is made manifest in the movie by the character of baby face nelsonin the last scene of the movie we are presented with an image of a flood washing away a valley everett explains that the entire state will be put on hydroelectricity which will bring in an age of reason and put an end to backward ways indeed the viewer knows that everetts prophecy has come true since the 1940s america has been reformed by electricity however given the ambivalence with which the movie treats the idea of reform perhaps everetts optimism is premature it is ultimately left to the viewer to decide whether the vast reform of america brought about by technology is like radio a cultural progression or else like the narrative of the movie itself a stepbackwards,black_comedy
a great movie that is based off of the odyssey it is about three guys in a chain gang who escape from a prison work force to look for a treasure they meet a blind prophet a man who sold his soul to the devil to play the guitar and a oneeyed bible salesman this movie is full of humor and adventure if you know the odyssey the movie gets better the movie is a bit of a musical but they dont just randomly burst into music when they sing anything it is always live like man of constant sorrows where it tells a bit about the characters and is a piece of the odyssey and they are just singing to get money so this creates a lot of concerts and singing congregations overall it is a very unique movie,black_comedy
a really enjoyable wellrounded film going experience with great music great cast and plenty of laughter to go around the film is about three chain gang prisoners who make a cunning escape while on work detail george clooneys character was particularly amusing what with his similarities to garry shandling hows my hair i also didnt realize what a physical comedian john turturro is funniest thing ive seen him in yet without money but seeking treasure they embark upon a strange and comical journey from becoming a recording act called the soggy bottom boys to a bank robber to sirensits almost like forrest gump in a way i guess the ridiculous cast of characters they stumble upon are surprising and enjoyable its a feel good movie despite the fact that so many things go wrong but in a coen brothers sort of way i dont think this was quite as awesome as the big lebowski but its close definitely one of their finest the great thing about this film is that it does have something for everyone and i would recommend this to all,black_comedy
the coen brothers refreshingly splendid adaptation of homers the odyssey is a treat to watch like many of their movies it is one that you want to revisit again soon though essentially a comedy it is layered with subtleties such as the poignancy of the themes the metaphors and symbolism an example is when the prisoners loosely tied together in chains sharply contrast with the daughters loosely tied together with twinethe brothers wonderfully capture the essence of the 1930s southern america their attention to detail through language costumes sets music and the gestures of the actors and extras is commendable to say the least the writing is eloquent and the layered humour whether satirical slapstick situational or metaphorical always made one laugh out loudthe sepia tinted colouring adds to the heated 30s atmosphere the coen brothers have an ear for music as they always manage to get the right music director who knows to pick the right songs in addition the songs themselves are very satisfying to the ears and mind and in this case they are visualized fantasticallyblake nelson clooney and torturro are superb as the 3 idiots on the run they play their roles very naturally each assuming the roles of the naive one the impulsive one and the intellectual one john goodman was a surprising casting decision as hes like you have never seen before holly hunter is a pleasant surprise and she provides a nice toucho brother where art thou will have you laughing out loud but youll also be thinking about it and discussing it with friends long after the closing credits have rolled,black_comedy
this is my favorite movie of all time and one of only a few i can watch over and over i have watched it with my boys who are now grown at least a dozen times it fits well into history and coen does a great job of developing the characters i love bluegrass gospel and country music so that doesnt hurt my opinion since the movie is loaded with all the actors are superb and there is a favorite line for everyone the music is good the plot keeps moving and there is never a dull moment if for some crazy reason you havent seen it its time to rent the dvd and pop some pop cornor better yet buy it you may want to watch again and again,black_comedy
this coen brothers film may have been a flop in the boxoffice but anyone who is just in the mood for a great lighthearted comedy should check out this film it certainly may not always be pc but for those that love a little coarse comedy will appreciate the fun in this film george clooney may not have put his deepest character forward but what a shot at comedy not to let out the twist on a classic homer odyssey but even without catching inspiration to this plot it is still something worth the viewers time just a little disclaimer to my endorsement though those that are easily offended should not sit in the utter hope of loving this film because it does play off of so many stereotypes,black_comedy
despite the based on homers the odyssey credit at the beginning of the film ethan and joel coen claim to have never read the book its hard to believe otherwise because aside from explicit plot references to the great greek poet a pure piece of coen extravaganza iconic characters silly names absurd situations and dialogue worth rememberingthe brothers fourth comedy after raising arizona barton fink and the hudsucker proxy tells the story of three convicts george clooney john turturro and tim blake nelson who manage to break out of jail and set out to find a buried treasure 12 million dollars somewhere in a depressionstricken mississippi everett ulysses mcgill clooney a man who knows how to talk his way out of trouble is also determined to win back the love of his wife penny holly hunter during their colorful journey they run into a trumpet player who says he has sold his soul to the devil and form a country music band to avoid regular peoples suspicions something that ought to come in handy when law enforcers an evil salesman john goodman and even the ku klux klan are looking for thema light affair but that doesnt make it less satisfying than other coen brothers pictures alongside their usual care for dialogue and performance clooney and turturro are the standouts plenty of plaudits should go to their reconstruction of the historical period the movie takes place in particularly through roger deakins oscarnominated cinematography in addition given the story the soundtrack is another source of joy especially when the soggy bottom boys that would the stage name used by the main characters perform in front of an audience its a hilarious film filled with vitality and happiness and a strangely optimistic piece of work coming from the coensin short this is another artistic triumph for cinemas most talented brothers definitely worth watching even if you havent read the alleged source material,black_comedy
wow after 8 long years i finally have the chance to see the much hyped o brother where are thou  in my opinion this movie definitely deserved an oscar nomination for the best picture people may have different idea about the movie especially those who are not familiar with american culture but i liked it a lot regardless of some jokes that i didnt getit is said that the movie is loosely based on the epic poem odyssey by homer which i didnt believe in the first place but after some moment the movie become more and more convincing and disturbingly ironic it really took me some time to realize that its a political satire rather than some cheap comedythe story begins with 3 prisoners escaped from a gravedigging field and tried to escape to ones cousins home later on more and more irony happened like snowball running off the mountain for 10 dollars they sang a diy folk song along with a blue singer who supposedly sold his soul to the devil or whatever and they hoorayed at the 10 dollars they made knowing little about their future in the music careerthe story which has so much to tell virtually involved so many recognizable historical moments in us from the great depression to the kkk in the eyes of the 3 prisoners all the people around are crazy as hell just like the messages they try to communicate in the epic poemsbesides george clooney again played a likable character910,black_comedy
charming is a word id never thought id use to describe a coen brothers film who previously have treated us to such violent extremities as bodies being jammed into wood chippers and pneumatic cattle guns pulverising foreheads on the surface a simplistic comedyadventure story but in true coen brothers fashion nothing is as it seemsset in mississippi 1937 as the great depression nears its end george clooney plays ulysses mcgill a scheming energetic criminal who flees the roadside as prisoners smash rocks unfortunately for him hes chained to two dimwitted coescapees and even after the chains are off they stick together to find the loot ulysses buried before being prosecutedthe film is partially based on homers epic greek poem odyssey and many of the famous episodes from it have had a typical coen twist of character and quirk to fit with the different time space and the sensibilities associated with the depressionera south instead of the monstrous cyclops theres a boisterous deceptive oneeyed bible seller the allusions to odyssey are expertly weaved avoiding indulgence and not seeming forced each character and situation seem to naturally belong in the world the coens create like the big lebowski and fargo the bizarre universe of o brother is full of human behavioural traits and actions we can recognise but still laugh at the ridiculousness ofthere are references to other cultural tales tommy johnson a blues musician in the film claims to have perfect guitar skills after selling his soul to the devil a reference to real life urban legend of blues musician robert johnson doing the same in return for a mastery of the guitar even the title is based upon the filmwithinafilm from preston sturgess sullivans travels the director in the film wishes to make a depressionera starkrealistic drama but gradually realises that a comedy would be much more beneficial conversely in o brother the mood of the period is one that in theory wouldnt lend to the comedic material the coens devise one of the bleakest points in american social history is somehow reworked into a time of vibrancy and assorted excitementmythology in all its forms is both an important influence on the narrative and a plot point in itself ulysses his jail buddies and the blues musician record a version of man of constant sorrow for a radio station after hearing they can make some quick bucks from just singing into a can the song travels fast through the state of mississippi and the mysterious soggy bottom boys are a hit the mythology surrounding them brings people together in speculation and idolisation so when they show up on stage at a dinner party the crowd goes wild even the politicians get in on it as the running candidate for governor jumps on stage and dances along to help his failing campaign the coens both celebrate and explore the power of myths of legends and wordofmouth for our culturei earlier referred to this film as charming which is a clear understatement considering how hilarious uplifting and exciting this film is but charm is appropriate too due to one of the best uses of music in recent years the bluegrassfolk music is at the core of the films everchanging mood and vital to expressing each varying episodes tone from the opening scene of prisoners singing as they smash rocks the unified beat provided by their labour we know that music going to be important in the film george clooney excels himself as ulysses mcgill providing excellent comedic timing while playing off his two sidekicks with quick wit and guile who knew george clooney was such a funny performer the physical comedy is done wonderfully too as in the scene with ulysses taking two punches in quick succession clooney widens his eyes and flits his head to the side twice to shrug off the punches as he circles his opponent the rest of the cast are all impressive providing another amusing array of coen caricatures forming a delightful comedy trio with clooney are tim blake nelson and john turturro the group has masses of chemistry  the film could simply be the three arguing for the entire duration and it would be just as funny even with the quickpaced plot the two supporting performers give the characters personality and depthits noteworthy that this is the first film in hollywood to be entirely colourcorrected digitally the film has a distinct sepiatoned hue reminiscent of old photographs framing the landscapes in the period of the great depression immersing us in that old lost time a unique film in the coens canon never have they made such a purely joyous film  and they may never again but for now o brother is deservedly up there with their best,black_comedy
i laughed so hard i couldnt even breathe when i saw this the dialog was very clever and george clooney was excellent in it i also liked the music it was very good i also liked the scene with the blind man in the radio station it was incredibly goofyi also liked the scene were they thought that pete was a toad george clooney and tim blake nelson were hilarious i love the line them sirens did this to him they loved him up and turned him into ahorny toad the coen brothers dont disappoint with this movie this to me is their comedic writing at its best so if you hear anyone who says this movie sucked dont listen to them see it youll love it,black_comedy
the coens are excellent at regional movies and letting their characters find their own voice this one speaks and sings volumesfrom beginning to end this is my favorite coen brother movie with fargo so very close behind george clooney is perfect as huckster with a hear ulysses everett mcgill who leads his merry band of chain gang members through depressionera mississippi breaking down racial lines and galloping through the countryside meeting celebrities such as george baby face nelsonafter convincing his chain gang mates that he has a treasure hidden away they become targets for sirens bible salesmen and kkk memberscharles durning john goodman holly hunter who i actually like here as mcgills longsuffering exwife and more join inthe soundtrack is just as wonderful on its own as it is in the movieremember keep on the sunny side of life,black_comedy
fans of blue grass music and slapstick comedy will be delighted by this depressionera adventure however those looking for a modernday rendition of homers the odyssey will be rather disappointed although parallels are evident o brother where art thou has an entirely different storyline and fails to make deeper connections to the epic poemthe majority of the coen brothers references to the odyssey involve same or similar names examples of this would include the sirens ulysses and odysseus and penelope and penny while their names may sound alike their behaviors certainly arent take ulysses and odysseus for example odysseus was portrayed as a man of great strength wit and godlike qualities ulysses everett mcgill on the other hand possessed no extraordinary talents and focused more on how his hair looked than his future similarly homers penelope remained loyal to her husband for twenty years while the coen brothers penny got engaged to a suitor even telling her children that their father had died wasnt it a little odd that the children called their mothers fianc a suitor finally homers sirens were more than just seductive beauties doing the laundry they signified odysseus ability to generally resist women quite the contrary of ulysses aside from the big dan reference to the cyclops which seemed rather arbitrary and a few other obvious allusions the coen brothers failed to emphasize the essential themes of the odyssey such as loyalty while the coen brothers were unable to successfully translate the odyssey i do believe it is possible to be triumphant in producing a modernday rendition of it a different setting would be necessary along with a more clever way of disguising homers original story funny witty and entertaining everything but a modernday translation to the odyssey,black_comedy
in the movie o brother where art thou it successfully translates the epic the odyssey into a more modern perspective to start both of the stories begin in the middle in the odyssey it starts with odysseus trapped on calypsos island and then it explains the previous events also the three men from o brother where art thou are escaping a labor farm without explaining how they got there both main characters are embarked on a seemingly impossible journey odysseus must travel across oceans to return home to his family and everett escapes from the chain gang with the help of his loyal yet ignorant friends pete and delmar odysseus also had followers or a crew and at times there are parallels to the foolishness of odysseus crew and everretts friends pete and delmar odysseus crew for example were the ones who cut open the bag of winds which blew their ship off course and they also killed cows that belonged to helios the god of sun consequently pete is the one who led the trio to the sirens who seduced the three taking peteanother parallel between the odyssey and that the antagonist in both works first appears to be hospitable but turns out to hostile polyphemus for example welcomed odysseus and his crew but soon enough was swallowing his men whole also big dan had a picnic with everett and delmar and making business with them suddenly he is clubbing them both with a large branch and taking their money one of the most notable similarities is the planning or the idea of the main characters wife remarrying penelope odysseus wife is plagued by the marriagethirsty suitors a coincidence is that penny everetts wife is similar to the name penelope which is odysseus wife also both odysseus and everett disguised themselves in order to get close to their wives and make sure they dont remarry what seems to be another coincidence is that both penny and penelope doubt that the concealed man is actually their husband finally it seems peculiar how both stories are portrayed in almost a foreign worlds with the different lingo and phrases as well as customs and motives with the numerous parallels in both plot and theme the coen brothers successfully translated the epic the odyssey into a more modern film o brother where art thoudwizzleps ms werner is cool,black_comedy
in the movie o brother where art thou the coen brothers were unsuccessful in comparing it to the novel the odyssey there were some similarities such as the idea of returning home and certain obstacles such as the sirens it fails to relate to the odysseys underlying themes of hospitality and loyalty although they have story lines relating to journeys home they are still entirely different in the odyssey odysseus is perceived as a godlike hero however in o brother where art thou everett fails to think about his actions also when the sirens sing to everett pete and delmar all of them become lurred into there song however in the odyssey odysseus is able to withstand there singing this shows his strength and resistance toward making fast decisions also when odysseus is away his wife penelope remains loyal to him for twenty years however in o brother where art thou everett returns to find his wife penny engaged all of these examples display how the movie o brother where art thou failed to relate to the odyssey the coen brothers failed to create a modern day movie based on the odyessy the novel the odyssey strongly portrays hospitality and loyalty to others and to the gods in the ancient greek times these themes were expressed during everyday life for example in the odyssey menelaus invites odysseus into his home and treats him like loyalty however in modern day times these characteristics are barely ever used this is present today through the 2008 presidential election many people are hesitant to vote for hilary clinton because she is a woman and barack obama because he is an african american the difference between the movie and the odyssey is due to different values present during there era,black_comedy
in the movie o brother where art thou the coen brothers unparalleled homers epic the odyssey although both stories showed a journey home full of hardships they still have vast differences the movie characters were wondering around on their journey home and made decisions without thinking of the consequences or the downfalls at the time however odysseus though out and planned every decision which is one of the reasons he was a strong leader and well respected the odyssey doesnt translate well into a modern day movie this epic contains many ancient greek values such as hospitality and loyalty also it shows how the greeks felt the gods has an impact of everything in their lives odysseus supposively didnt get killed in the battle of troy like his fellow soldiers because he was blessed by the gods odysseus was looked up to no matter what decision he made by the people of ithaca however today he would be compared to the president which isnt always backed up by the people of the united states such as the war in iraq therefore the values of the ancient greeks are different from our modern day values,black_comedy
an offbeat movie that strays from the usual hollywood mold it is entertaining and refreshing yet misleading the movie claims to be based on homers the odyssey but this is barely true as of thirty minutes into the movie the plot references were barely evident during the opening credits the connection is stated yet for a good portion of time that is the only inclination to any similarities in addition the biggest connection between the two stories is the movies allusions to the book not the similarities in the plot there are some plot connections but they are different enough to change the story also most of the connections are through words for example the only reference to charybdis and scylla is george clooneys repetition of the phrase were in a tight spot and there is no plot reference to this this is one of several examples of the use of language to convey the similarities overall the movie was good even though it was not exactly what it had claimed to be it is difficult to determine whether the odyssey translates well into a modern day movie based on o brother where art thou this is because the movie is not completely based on the epic based on the movie at hand the odyssey translated well due to the creativity required to translate it the coen brothers needed a great deal of creativity to translate several monsters and situations into a modernday scenario this led to clever and different situations such as the oneeyed bible sales man the seductive sirens the tidal wave and so on these were referring to odysseus encounters with polyphemus the sirens and athenas help the coen brothers were geniuses for having the ability to successfully translate one of the oldest stories into an entertaining modernday film,black_comedy
i think that the coen brothers did not do a good job of translating the odyssey into a movie i feel that it was too loosely based for them to even say it had something to do with epic by homer in addition i believe the few parts that were based on the odyssey were so random that it had no effect on the movie whatsoeveri do think however that making the odyssey into a blockbuster movie is very attainable this is because of the possible special affects and scenery available to production companies now in addition they couldve found a much better actor for the role of an odysseus type character than george clooney i mean he doesnt exactly resemble the odysseus type of person i pictured and the same goes for penny penelope in the odyssey penny in the movie she didnt really seem like the type of person to play penelope my final comment is that there was no telemachus he had his 2 buddies from jail but his children in the movie were all around 10 and under he was a major character in the poem and was nonexistent in the movie,black_comedy
in the movie i understand that it is suppose to be a spooftranslation of the famous novel the odyssey however after reading the book myself in class i feel that although certain things in the book symbolize the different events in the novel overall the coen brothers did not successfully translate the odyssey into a modern day film george clooney captures almost all of the qualities of odysseus cocky brave and somewhat clever however he does not have the quality of being looked upon as something semidivine or a role model to other men also his wife does not seem to want him the least bit back while in the novel penelope greives over her husbands death while in the film everetts wife makes up his death herself and everetts two friends pete and dolmer who are they suppose to be in my eyes they are the most random characters in the movie considering odysseus had to eventually find his way back on his own with a little help from the goddess athena in conclusion although such things as john goodmans character portraying the cyclops and the women by the river representing the sirens everything else is not what the odyssey exactly is,black_comedy
like all the coen movies its wellmade and beautiful to look at and to listen to it also has the common coen problems it isnt really about anything and is kind of shaggy and seems once you step back and look at it to have been primarily a stylistic exercise but theres beauty and wit here just the same the music is well worth remembering still there are nagging feelings while everything in the movie works i get the feeling i didnt experience as much beauty here as the brothers intended me to i only recall feeling chills for sheer beauty one time this in a film with many shots and songs included for beauty alone this review sounds much more negative than it should i rather liked the movie i liked the babyface nelson stuff the joke on local politics the sirens the toad john goodman beating people with a tree branch theres plenty to like but everything is at a distance or else seems airlight and inconsequential for instance even allowing that its a comedy and being a coen bros film is a play on style and stereotypes does the viewer care if clooney gets his wife and children back i didnt nor do we mind much when it seems pete has become a toad nor when we find out hes been put back in a chain gang nor more importantly does the movie seem to care the only time one feels anything like concern for the characters is when theyre about to be hung after having been pardoned and even then my interest and my thoughts of how unfair only lasted a second or two then i remembered what movie i was watching and thought oh its all so damn lackadaisical anyway seven points for style,black_comedy
the coen brothers are among the finest filmmakers in the world nearly every one of their films has been a delight in some way theyre just so unique bursting with ideas and theyre never less than engaging and in the case of o brother where art thou theyve made their first attempt at rewriting an already preexisting work of fiction rather than adapted a story from scratch like their previous films and what a film it is o brother may be a slightly disjointed tale but its filled with so many fascinating characters absorbing situations and catchy musical numbers that youre hookedbased rather loosely on homers odyssey the coens have taken a stab at reworking the story as a sort of unconventional road trip movie and its a largely successful attempt set in 1937 during the height of the great depression in the mississippi delta o brother follows the adventures of three escaped convicts from a chain gang the self elected leader of the group ulysses everett mcgill a surprisingly hilarious george clooney pete john turturro and delmar tim blake nelson one more dimmer than the lastmcgill is searching for buried loot he supposedly pillaged from an armoured truck robbery since he was chained to pete and delmar he had to bring them with him promising to cut them in on the stash they begin an unforgettable adventure across the deep south encountering a diverse number of eccentrics numerous runins with the law finding fame as a singing trio corrupt governors the kkk and a race to reconcile mcgill with his estranged wife penny holly hunter before she remarrieso brother is a film that pulls us in quite a few different directions its a film of many sorts one minute its a comedy the next its a musical some parts serious and other parts tragic it even touches upon mystical tones at times in the hands of another director o brother could have emerged as a fragmented mess but these are the coen bros in all their films their direction is masterful and so it is here they transform o brother into a wonderfully rich multilayered experienceone thing that makes o brother worth the price of admission is the sheer number of bluegrass music gospel songs and blues numbers that populate the background theyre incredibly catchy intensely hummable and seriously memorable they create an almost magical mysticism at times like the scene where mcgill  co encounter modern day sirens three beautiful washerwomen who do nothing except sing its an eerie scene because even as they appraise these men they still keep singing their hypnotic songor the scene where they come across a communal baptism theyre in the woods when suddenly from out of nowhere people arrive in droves slowly walking to the lake to be baptised they just keep walking and singing like in a trance the music infuses these scenes with an almost tangible feeling of magic in the airbut the one song that you have to hear is the one they sing as the soggy bottom boys they make a sidetrip to a radio station just to earn some quick cash but the song they come up with is an instant hit with people and its a great song too youll be humming it for hours after the films finishedo brother is filled with great actors from beginning to end in fact i cant think of one single bad performance in the entire film the acting is great all across the board george clooney is a revelation as the slick fastthinking mcgill hes never been as likable in any other film as he has here some of his slackjawed facial expressions are hilarious hes an entertaining leader and turturro and nelson are comically endearing as his travelling companionsjohn goodman a coen regular appears halfway through as a surprisingly scary bible salesman i had no idea he could be so convincingly sinister he at first emerges with his usual jovial personality but when he crushes a toad with his bare hand youll see a side of him you never knew existedthe coens trademark black humour crops up from time to time even if it is a little restrained by their usual standards in fact o brother is surprisingly light for a coen film except for one scene thats shocking in its audacity an encounter with the kkk that turns into a choreographed dance number its a stunning scene that simultaneously highlights their evil and their single minded mentality it also shows you what the coens can get away with tooas things draw to a close quite a few of the films plot lines converge involving a crooked election the trios last stand against the law mcgills marriage and some divine interventionamong the coens best work the golden cinematography gloriously highlights the film the different individual vignettes takes us on a marvellously entertaining trip through the deep south and the eclectic actors and their performances make the film into a real treatunmissable,black_comedy
o spoilers where art thou three chained inmates the loquacious and a little vain everett ulysses mcgill george clooney the childlike and easily foolable delmar tim blake nelson and the temperamental pete john turturro embark in a spectacular journey after a great treasure or at least thats what everett assures them oftheyll find a treasure but like a blind man predicts to them its not the one theyre looking for and manage to become country stars on the waythis is one of the funniest retelling of homers the odyssey i have ever seen the atmosphere of the 20s is really palpable here and everybody does a great job with what they have to work withwe also find out that yes there is one thing george clooney cant do  singing in fact he seems to have been so bad he had to be dubbed by a professional singer especially playing a lead singer in the filmanyway minor quibble watch this movie and have a lot of fun coen style o brother where art thou 910,black_comedy
when i first saw this filmmy teen age boys had rented it for us to watch i liked it very muchbut i was busy during the movie and didnt really get to focus on it just recently i caught it one day on dish network and watched it more closely now i cant stop watching pausing rewinding etc i find more and more things that i missed every time i see it it is definitely on my all time best movies ever list the most incredible cast and directing and writing and cinematography the irony and innuendos and subtleties are absolutely brilliant and without a doubt in my mind the best movie performance from george clooney,black_comedy

like most of the coen brothers films i think this one takes repeated viewings to really get it yes its a comedy but its not some stupid adam sandler drivel its got depth and while some here have said the characters lack depth i must disagree they are all quirky but the lead ulyses everet mcgill  he had a depth of character that i think could even have carried him as a character into other movies quirky  hell yeah  hes a candidate for the quirkiest character in any movie ive ever seen  but it works in this movieid say as well that this is the highest review i will ever give for a prochristian movie  you may have to read back a few reviews to see what i mean but i do mean itthis is a movie about salvation plain and simple while his cohorts gain salvation the easy way southern baptism everet spends the whole movie earning his salvation which he plainly gets at the end of the movie as he asks for salvation in front of the devil and his hound dog and is granted said salvation in one of the strangest manners you are likely to seebut religious or not i liked the characters in this movie almost without fault and the historical nature of seeing the likes of tommy johnson the first rock guitarist and george baby face nelson reputed bank robber just added a nice touch of 1930sand i would be remiss if i didnt mention that this has to be without a doubt for me at least the movie with the most memorable lines of all time from ill be a sonofabitch  delmars been saved to hows my hair or i dont want fop  im a dapper dan man  this movie has some memorable dialogmy highest rating and a mustown dvd,black_comedy
this 2000 film from the coen brothers ethan and joel features the adventures of three southern men crisscrossing the south and encountering different southern legends and famous features the adventurers consist of two rather slow if likable men delmar and pete tim blake nelson and john turturro both fantastic in signifying slow reaction times and a smoothtalking wouldbe renaissance man everett george clooney playing a role which the smooth clooney imbues his character with nave shortsightedness typical of many wouldbe smoothtalkers cross the south encountering many archetypes and legends of the area as they go joel and ethan coen have done a fantastic job of linking many tales of the south and connecting the characters to this voyage by taking as their framework homers the odyssey in which the characters had adventures all occurred within one day the film opens with the main characters working on the chain gang and seeming northerner and coincidentally the schemer clooney concocting a scheme whereby he and some other men can escape and thereby return to his wife the versatile holly hunter playing penny everetts tough but exasperated estranged wife before she remarries they cross the mythical crossroads the site supposedly where guitarist robert johnson sold his soul to the devil in exchange for amazing guitarplaying abilities where they pick up a man obviously envisioned as a stand in for johnson tommy johnson chris thomas king and with him they perform black music for a blind record producer to whom they tell they tell some sly and very funny lies pete and delmar are baptized and reborn while wouldbe renaissance man everett mocks their sudden reverence for what he regards as foolish superstition they encounter a particularly psychotic religious huckster in big dan teague a fantastic john goodman the klan is also lampooned hilariously and savagely some have critiqued this film for being less than the sum of its parts but i think that this criticism misses the mark although the settings might be distinct the use of the odyssey to tie these sites together seems to me to provide enough structure to give the film a narrative coherence and to be honest even were the narrative of the odyssey not used i believe that the examination of many southern features also provides the film with a thematic constancy and even were that not so i believe that the notion that the film is too varied in tone is not really a legitimate criticism i dont see that there is a lot of criticism of many big hollywood films which are narratively incoherent let alone consistent in tone and i believe that the variety of concerns which coen address make for an interesting and rich film tapestry,black_comedy
after watching a lot of b and cmovies in the last couple of weeks i liked to go tonight to watch a movie which has a good imdb ratingi looked into my dvdregal and saw a movie i bought by amazon before a lot of weeks for only 6 bucks it was o brother where art thouand that what this movie brought to me was over all my expectations i expect a good movie  and i got a really great moviegeorge clooney john turturro and tim blake nelson played great the atmosphere of the southstate feeling is great too into not one of the 106 minutes playtime you got bored or disappointed there are a lot of humor and even more music in it yeah  sometime you think it is a specially art of a musical or something like this but this is not negative for this movie  i think the music elements adapt oneself to the movieall in one i can everyone recommend to watch this masterpiece of movieart,black_comedy
i thoroughly enjoyed o brother where art thou but wondered what i was in for when i opted to hire the dvd the acting dialogue settings and scenery were superb the changing expressions on the faces of the three main actors during the course of the action were priceless i also loved the music which added greatly to the appreciation of the plot the songs and choruses that pervade the production reminded me of greek theatre as exemplified by the plays of sophocles or aeschylus in ancient greek drama the chorus had an important function it was an emotional bridge between spectators and actors this came across very vividly during the film and if id been in the cinema more so since one would have been part of an audience its an unusual film and i would liked to have seen it on the big screen but even on dvd its a spectacular experienceif i have one criticism it is that some of the scene changes were rather abrupt it results in the viewer having difficulty to connect a scene change with what preceded it  especially as regards the dialogue but thankfully the songs and choruses maintained the flow of the plot,black_comedy
when tackling homers odyssey within a modern medium the question is not only how do you abbreviate it but what modern underpinnings can you apply for example steely dan used the blues idiom infused with selfdeprecating irony to produce a deceptively simple reinterpretationhere the coens have to rely on movie phrasing to permit audience digestion visibly we have ulisse i am a fugitivethe man who broke 1000 chains with durning as the anchor sullivans travels crossroads dillinger etcbut the key is all of this is reconstructed on top of the coens own raising arizona reimagined as a musical the combination of real placesurreal eventssurreal characters plainly derives from that earlier work goodman even replicates his earlier fight sceneand this is better than most musicals because the musical narrative is not a separate reality imposed on top of the movie reality but seamlessly integrated to serve both the art and the storya fun little journey,black_comedy
the music brilliantly propels and enhances the action of this film i saw this film with my son who had just studied homers odyssey in his advanced placement english literature class he picked up on the nuances within the story line and identified parallels with homeri also noted the early chain gang scenes were well done and reminiscent of paul munis classic i was a fugitive from a chain gang the climatic flood scene which rescues the hapless trio from hanging is based in realitythe tennessee valley authority flooded out entire sections of the rural south the computergenerated water scene with the dogs multiple cans of fop hair ointment was used as a music video to great effecti appreciated the atmosphere of the depressionera south conveyed by the small town atmosphere there was attention to period details such as penelope with her small daughters in tow dressed in feedsack fabric dresses,black_comedy

odd yet you have an itch to finish it if you were to be interrupted halfway through the movie it is based off the oddysey and at first you find that funny but if you think about it many things relate to the book which i never read yet only know about through referrals in another booksome relations are the fact that george clooney plays a man named ulysses everett mcgill and ulysses is roman for oddyseus however your spell that also the sexy sirens bewitching pete which some supernatural woman did to most of the men in the oddysey the wifes name is penny which i think has some relationship to a woman named penelope in the book my friend mentioned some similarities she has read the book by being given some impossible tasks such as get the ring from a 9000 ft lake the sheriff with the hound is said to be like poseidon because he was chasing after everett throughout the moviethis was an enjoyable movie not on my top 25 list but mostlikely on my top 100 george clooney and tim blake nelson stole the show to me though other characters such as tommy johnson and the oneeyed bible salesman i dont know his name were a hoot too,black_comedy
i have to admit i really was not interested in seeing o brother where art thou im not into the southern theme type of movies nor did i ever get into the odessey im also in no way interested in country music and george clooney but surprisingly o brother turned out to be a fantastic movie that i was completely wrong about and am so glad to have given it a chancethe acting and story line is just so great and both my mom and i surprising loved the music its just such a great feel good movie with great comedic moments this is definitely is worth a watch and a buy for anyone my favorite moment is the reaction to jake missing and the boys assume he is a toad youll have to see it to understand but its just hilarious 910,black_comedy
what can i say about this movie from the guys who made the big lebowski blood simple and the man who wasnt there not to mention fargo plus raising arizona i could go on but please look the coen brothers up for yourself this film is very near perfect the story is maybe not the most original in the world but the way the coens tell it is i dont want to give anything away for the people that havent seen it needless to say the direction cinematography acting and soundtrack are all absolutely first rate please if you get the chance see this movie you will absolutely not regret it at all also look out for the cabin at the end it looks almost the same as the evil dead cabin i wonder why he he he paul ps stop reading go check out the coen brothers you wont regret it,black_comedy
when i first rented this movie i had heard about the unbelievable soundtrack and so my family and i decided to give it a whirl i must say its one of my favorites to datethe story itself is clearly derived from the odyssey and we see frequent references and resemblances as such our heroes run into various monsters and the like cyclopes sirens etc while some may be turned off by the strange themes and circumstances anyone who had read heard of andor liked the odyssey will most likely enjoy this film all the actors do their part well especially clooney who while his role may seem a tad reminiscent of his other work does a very nice job of portraying the main protagonistthe biggest treat out of all is the movies score the score is absolutely wonderful featuring all variety of original music by popular artists such as alison krauss and gillian welchoverall this is a good movie for those who enjoy any one of the genres it falls under i would suggest renting it and checking out as it is not for everyone despite anyones tastes however it is undeniably a fine work of art that will be remembered,black_comedy
entertaining if somewhat ultimately silly picaresque tale set in the rural south of the 1930s george clooney is the brainy member of a trio of escaped convicts whose unlikely and sometimes scarcely believable adventures comprise the storyline the photography is wonderful the characterizations generally very good along the way they become unexpected recording stars when their spontaneous performance at a rural radio station strikes a chord with listeners for those who might doubt john turturros credibility as a rural hick check out his performance here holly hunter has a minor role as clooneys wife who has told their kids he was dead charles durning is a hoot as the governor of mississippi one scene that struck me as somewhat strange was the ku klux klan scenario toward the end of the film certainly worth watching for escapist fare and you might be entertained by the music too as so many were,black_comedy
i recently saw this for the first time and was very pleasantly surprised this is a very thoughtful well done film all around john turtorro is a terrific actor capable of portraying an amazing range of characters its hard to imagine that this is the same person who very effectively played the nerdy herb stempel in quiz show but i also think george clooney and tim blake nelson did very fine work here as well the coen brothers clearly took a chance in adapting homers work to a southern depressionera setting but the gamble paid off handsomely and we are given a very amusing story beautiful to look at with wonderful cinematography the authentic recreation of the depression era was masterful right down to the minutest detail the music is great and very fitting the scene with the three sirens on the river is one of the most unusual and haunting ever created  you will be as stunned as the three protagonists appear the first time you see itall in all a wonderful film  one youll want to look at several times,black_comedy
as with other coen brothers films such as raising arizona i would have rated this below a 5 after the first viewing however after a reviewing this has definitely proved an excellent filmmany comedies are only funny the first time and then become a joke youve already heard oh brother is replayable with its rich dialog great oldtimey soundtrack symbolism foreshadowing and subtle at times humorthe dialog is hilarious the oracles speech is truly prophetic for all men tim blake nelson is either really an idiot or a superb actornotice the constant expression clooney is good comedian and if youre a coen fan you probably already love turturro,black_comedy
the best coen films are usually the ones that have extreme quirks like the one and only barton fink here however the muddled storyline is too ordinary or to put it another way the coens seem to want some kind of mainstream acceptance that has otherwise not been their goal before the cast does well in their respective roles but there is something too familiar about the whole set up yes there were a lot of rural dramas in the 30s and 40s but the coens seem too much in love with these movies to satirize them that means that it is more of an homage than reinterpretation and thats a shame because they had so good luck with their ode to screwball comedy the hudsucker proxy all the coens favorites are here including john goodman john turturro and holly hunter but most of the time is wasted on crass southern stereotypes and to make fun of them is acceptable but its annoying to see it for the umpteenth time the best thing about this is the tinted photography which gives the film a worn out look that goes great with the rural setting otherwise this can only be described as a failed effort but even lowgrade coen is better than almost every other movie so i have continued to see their movies because which other directorwriterproducer team do the us have that are more than just providers of pop corn entertainment,black_comedy
the coen brothers continually astound me and im not sure if that is a good thing every time i think ive figured them or their films out they pull one over on me the hudsucker proxy had some great humor but was mostly a homage to old comedies fargo was somewhat weird and oddly repetitive but had plenty of great humor the man who wasnt there is an excellent noir film intolerable cruelty was very funny all of them had great writing and dialog then around comes this what is it anyway a fresh interpretation of the odyssey the film revolves around everett a man on the run from the law with the other two thirds of his chain gang he goes through many trials and tribulations throughout the just over 90 minutes the film lasts until the conflict is finally resolved the plot is fine but there seems to be a nearly unlimited number of characters that just show up serve their purpose and disappear the pacing is daft the characters are fairly wellwritten and credible the dialog and script is wellwritten as is expected from the coens the acting is very good allround the humor works some of the time the quirkiness of some characters makes for some good laughs but thats about it all in all a fairly forgettable coen brothers film i recommend this to fans of the coen brothers and the actors involved fine for a single viewing 710,black_comedy
i find everything about this movie beautiful the cinematography is excellent and soulful at times breathtaking the odysseian framework of the story enables an easy transition into a mythical spiritual journey to self awareness and the power of being and love far and away clooneys best performance the music contained in the movie is one of american legend from the crossroads tales of robert johnson the bible belt gospel of alison krauss and the other songs which still today defy categorization such as man of constant sorrow and didnt leave nobody but the baby by an array of artists who themselves easily fall outside the pigeonholes this is the stirring homerian epic of americana magic like this only happens once yet i thirst for more,black_comedy
three cons in depressionera mississippi escape from a work farm and embark on a strange series of misadventures in which they are chased by the police record a hit record hook up with a bank robber are waylaid by three sirens get ambushed by a bible salesman rescue a man from the klu klux klan get pardoned by the state governor and are saved from certain death by a divine floodjoel and ethan coens strange but wonderful variation on homers odyssey is delightful filled with typically crackling dialogue friend some of your folding money has come unstole  and awash in great period music  blues gospel hillbilly yodelling zydeco what have you supervised by tbone burnett clooney turturro and particularly nelson make for a fine latterday version of the three stooges with plenty of goodnatured facepulling and doubletaking the large cast all make the most of their tonguetwisting lines and good il boy wardrobes  i especially like von bargen as the archetypal coen demonfiend complete with hellhound and sunglasses at night the title of the movie comes from the film joel mccrea wants to make but never does in preston sturges brilliant sullivans travels and some of the characters are based on real people king is legendary delta bluesman robert johnson for example the links with homers epic poem are a bit tenuous to say the least  a guy estranged from his wife seeking to win her back some sirens a cyclops sort of  and the script sometimes feels like its a collection of funny episodes strung together rather than a coherent story but its so much fun that it doesnt really matter director of photography roger deakins captures a fabulous sepiatoned look to the rural scenes and there are plenty of wonderful visual touches  my favourite being the moment the flood comes and as everything is submerged a school of clooneys dapper dan haircream tins perform an impromptu little aquaballet before our eyes this is a wonderfully unique toetapping comedy,black_comedy
this is one of those films you can watch over and over again always finding new things to laugh at i keep this in my all time favorites case i didnt want to see this for a long time because i though it mocking christianity but was glad to be wrong this time the music and humor are timeless and very well done i have never bought soundtracks until this movie came out if you dont like this movie i would say it reveals something about your character you likely have difficulty enjoying many aspects of life and take yourself far too seriously it is a beautifully shot film i hope this write up helps creates more fans for me to be in fellowship with tez,black_comedy
im pretty sure that when you tell people that this movie is a comedy that has been based on homers odyssey youll get two reactions but never a good one either they dont believe you thinking that such a classic story can never become a good comedy either they will not give the movie a try because they are convinced that this will be much too difficult for them to understand or because they arent familiar with the greek writer and his work no tell everybody that this is a comedy from the coen brothers and youll be sure that you have an interested audiencethis movie tells the story behind the adventures of three escaped convicts its 1937 and the economic crisis weighs heavy on everyone but the three man arent exactly worrying about their financial status they escaped from the jail chaingang with the intention to pick up the the loot of a bank heist that everett had stashed away near his home but their way is long and difficult they meet all kinds of strange characters sirens a bank robber a campaigning governor and his opponent a kkk lynch mob a blind prophet but dont have much time to really think about all that happens to them because the house will soon be flooded by a newly built damafter watching this movie i just needed a little break before i could go on with something else the reason for that is quite simple i had been laughing so hard that it almost started to hurt this is an incredibly funny movie with some excellent humor in it with this movie the coen brothers really made an excellent adaptation of the ancient odyssey although nt exactly a title that reminded me of an old greek writer before having all the correct information i even believed that this movie had something to do with shakespeare or someone from that time periodit isnt a very strict translation of the odyssey of course but it isnt too hard to find some similarities either like for instance the sirens but what would a movie be with a very good story when the acting isnt excellent indeed nothing at all but dont worry george clooney john turturro and tim blake nelson are absolutely brilliant their performances are amazing and i was especially surprised by tim blake nelson i cant remember that ive ever seen him play in another movie but what he did here only promises the best for the futureall in all this is a wonderful comedy that will not only be loved by the people who are familiar with homers odyssey this movie has been based on it but only loosely leaving enough room for a new interpretation and some excellent humor add to this some very fine acting and you know that you have another hit from the coen brothers i loved this movie and i cant remember that ive ever seen any comedy better than this one thats also the reason why i believe that this movie doesnt deserve anything less than an 8510,black_comedy
i am not a fan of country music but im not sure thats what i would call what the soggy bottom boys sing though not realistic the characters in this film are both likable and comical i love the language they use for example after picking up a hitchhiker who has sold his soul to satan and noting that his other companions had become saved everett comments that he is as of yet unaffiliated their odyssey leads them through some classical situations but always with a humorous turn holly hunter is everetts beautiful but nagging wife but his love for his daughters brings him back to the straight and narrow not only is the acting great but the script is brilliant the music is welldone and sometimes wonderful especially at the baptism if it had been rock and roll instead of country i might have given it a 10,black_comedy
althoug many details are extremely far fetched this story of rural mississippi ca 1935 has many realistic elements reminding of the dark side of life down south in the years prior to wwii george clooney is convincing as the streetwise and worldly selfappointed leader of a 3man team escaping from a chain gang the trio encounter a series of situations including a recordingsession at a makeshift studio owned by a blind radio station dj encounters with a bank robber a shifty crook posing as bible salesman and several nearlynchings inbetween scenes we see a rivalry between the incumbent governor and his radical challengerseveral scenes are powerful testimony to the social injustices of the day a secret nightly kkk rally is aweinspiring to see how an innocent man was to be offered up due to nothing other than his skin color is a shocking thing to view another vivid reminder of how things used to be is the sadistic prison official who has a keen interest in law enforcement namely lynchingsseveral critical moments turned out ok for our heroes right down to the act of god towards the end which gave a satisfying conclusion to the story i appreciated the many historically correct details yet the entire story was quite unlikely as in the green mile its like getting struck by lightning and winning the state lottery both on the same day and living to enjoy the fortune,black_comedy
being a true southernerncand having parents that grew up in that era it is a treat to see how close the coens come to getting it right granted there is some stereotyping and bias but only a person that has a true feeling of the times can appreciate it one thing that i loved that at times color was the least of the problems that the boys faced times were tough and it made people hard but still they could find joy in simple things the music flows beautifully and is integrated into the story so well george clooney proved that he could act and tim blake nelson stole the show with his simplicity john turturro was funny and the rest of the cast proved up to the challenge of being southern,black_comedy
i saw this when it was released at the theaters it was excellent on the big screen when it came out on video tape i bought it but i had noticed some of the footage had been left out i am wondering why at one point in the movie everette tells his wife that he is one of the soggy bottom boys and she doest believe him i remember that she said you are not one of the soggy bottom boys and dont go telling our girls that you were or something to that effect because this was cut out i wanted the dvd version and my son bought it for me well it was cut out of the dvd version also does anyone know why anyway near the end of the movie as the soggy bottom boys are on stage singing everettes wife drops her jaw open in disbelief as if she were thinking he was telling me the truth so what happened to the part where he told her that he in the group thanks,black_comedy
i resisted seeing this movie because of george clooneys political views but i guess ill have to learn to separate his movies from his politics this movie is one of the best ive ever seen george is great john turturro is great and tim blake nelson delivers a fantastic performance as delmar the blind guy at the radio station has his act down pat also the coen brothers should tackle a treatment of huckleberry finn next huck meets a cast of characters in the book who would fit in just fine in a coen movie and the time and place of the book would give them ample scope to do their magic i have never cared much for country music but this movie caused me to buy the cd and i and my family have fallen in love with the music and the movie listen to what the kkk is chanting during their drill and see if you dont laugh,black_comedy
when i this movie the first time i was a little sceptical what clooney in all around comedy so i thought i had to see it again then i love it to see george clooney as a language competent hair freak is just what even though the film has it ups and down with some mistakes on the way still i see i had to watch clooney in a comedy here is the guy who did from dusk till dawn in a comedy no no still clooney does have a ear for comedy worth a watch,black_comedy
o brother where art thou 2000 spoilers george clooney john turturro and tim blake nelson plays the three main characters in this adventure  satire  crime of a movie where the whole plot is aboutclooney plays everett he has a wife and daughters but the problem is that he is sitting in jail with his two buddies pete and delmar so the two of them run away and the only way everett get the two of them to take that risk is that he tells them theres a big treasure hidden someplace so they set out and soon theyll meet a lot of strange happenings like a bible  salesman thats a member of ku klux klan theyll sing in a single and be a huge hit theyll meet sensual clothes washers theyll meet a loser bandit that shoots on cowsi mean it is a adventure movie with laughs high dramatics and family problems and the movie is great joel and ethan coen has done one of their finest jobs if youre looking away from fargo and the three actors are great together you cant expect a pure comedy when youre going to see this movie cause it really aint it is more like a satirea crimeadventure its hard to put a word on it but it is very nice wathcing especially the song they sing im a man of constant sorrow great the movie has a special mood that keeps it going and off course there are dark sides as when the three of them dress up like ku klux klan members saves a negro friend and then kills a bunch of them i laughed it has a sweet style with the fine ending of everett getting together with his wife and as we leave them we see this man on a rail that we also saw in the beginning of the movie that makes a time perspective stars  45 very odd work,black_comedy
by sheer dumb luck this film became the coen brothers highest grossing film ever essentially this is homers odyssey by way of the three stooges everyone in the cast seems to be having a good ol time to get an idea of the sense of humor running through the film witness about 90 minutes through the most beautifully staged and choreographed clan rally ever put to film theres plenty of depressionera shenanigans and southern fried humor throughout cinematographer roger deakins does here for color and the south what later he did for black and white and suburban california in his next collaboration with the coen brothers the man who wasnt there he turns photographing shades shadows colors and textures into high art this aint no fargo folks its not even as deep as say oh the big lebowski the coen brothers really dont have much to say here but ill be damned if i didnt get caught up in the old timey spirit of it all in one of the strangest popculture phenomenas of the past ten years the old timey bluegrass soundtrack went on to become more popular than the film and swept the grammy awards i dare you not to tap your feet while clooney and the gang schuck and jive their way on home,black_comedy
this is not a movie you would expect somebody like clooney to be good in but he plays this character exactly right  since seeing this i have some new respect for him though i still think he is overrated  the best scene at least for me was when clooney sings their famous song at the dance very funny indeed  btw i have now seen only three cohen movies  fargo i just didnt get but raising arizona is funny  i think this one is not quite as funny but still very good,black_comedy
a decent movie but not the best from joel  ethan coen  i guess id have to rank it behind fargo the big lebowski millers crossing and blood simple  its about even with barton fink and raising arizona and definitely ahead of the man who wasnt there and the hudsucker proxyi guess the big winner in this grand project has to be performers of americana music who saw an explosion in popularity for their style during 2001  2002  despite what had to be enormous odds music producer tbone burnett literally did bring this music down from the mountain and into suburban livings rooms,black_comedy
very odd comedyadventure movie i really enjoyed the quirky characters and slightly surreal feel to the whole movie slight spoiler one funny touch was how the movie begins with the main characters on a chain gang and when we later see his children there are so many that the mother has them tagging along behind her tied to a string chain gang style,black_comedy
the color of the language and the performance of clooney and just about everyone else on the screen brought a smile to my face that just would not be erased even thinking now about that scene where pappy odaniel and his campaign staff are sitting on the porch makes me giggle uncontrollably the music was so cool i can see why america was in huff to rush out and buy the ost a wonderful movie that transcends any real criticism,black_comedy
this is one of those films you just know everyone will be watching in 100 years clooney is masterful as the clark gable esque ulyses and the rest of the cast act their socks off not really a comedy not at all a drama part road movie part fable high points include john goodman as the cyclops and the water bound finale also the dialogue is crafted from pure gold,black_comedy
i greatly enjoyed o brother where art thou the modern update of the odyssey  i had read the homer classic a few years before watching the movie but i still noticed the films obvious connections to the work  the movie is about three jailmates who escape only to face a long odyssey on their journey home  they go on multiple adventures and meet various characters including tempting laundry maids and a oneeyed bible salespersoni had absolutely no complaints with the film i had no idea what the movie was about before renting it but i was pleasantly surprised w the plot characters and soundtrack   george clooney does a great job in his portrayal of everette ulysses mcgill a modernday ulysses  the chemistry between his character and those of the other jailmates played by john turturro and tim blake nelson was memorable  at times i felt like i was watching an old episode of the three stooges the soundtrack was another great aspect of the film  i loved all the music even though i am not usually a fan country or blue grass another asset to the movie was that it is good for all ages  it was recommended to my by both my grandmother and my brothers friend age 10 its comical moments appeal to viewers of all agesthis was my first coen brothers film but it will not be my last  i cant wait to rent others especially if they are anything like this film  i would give the movie 810 stars  it was very funny yet unique  though great its definitely not for everyone you must be openminded when you watch it,black_comedy
this has to be one of the greatest movies of 2000  easily one of the greatest movies of 2000  george clooney and two other guys give wonderful performances as jailmates who break free and are on the run  this movie has very brilliant direction  if george clooney and the other guys wouldve at least been nominated for an academy award i wouldve been much happier this is a true gem of a movieoverall the entire movie is excellent and the whole john goodmans end was awesome  rating 10 out of 10,black_comedy
this was a wonderful movie  i underestimated this movie completely however after i watched it i loved it  the characters in it are great the story line is great very funny movie for all to enjoy i believe everyone likes this movie,black_comedy
i truly enjoyed this movie and i dont have much to add to the 94 comments before me however this is probably because i have been living in the usa for 5 years and to a certain extent americanized if you are reading this review from a country other than usa and if you have no familiarity with us culture and history whatsoever you have little chance of enjoying this movie i made the mistake of recommending this movie to friends back home and none so far seemed to enjoy it in fact they had pretty harsh comments about it there may be several reasons for this the south accent is very difficult to understand to a foreigner so most of them had to rely on the subtitles which can seldom do justice to movies in this movie this problem is more severe because this is not an action film this film is heavily based on verbal dialogue and you have to understand it in english to get it even when you know enough english to decipher the dialogue whether you will find it funny or not is likely a function of your familiarity with the us culture if you need someone to blame after seeing the movie and not enjoying it just blame whoever is importing these films into your country and marketing them as the next big thing so you are hereby warned,black_comedy
while i enjoyed this movie very much and would definitely recommend it i found george clooneys character to be too smart  the soundtrack was fabulous especially the soggy bottom boys  the movie alluded nicely to the story of homers odyssey yet played around a little with some variations  allinall a very good film,black_comedy
o brother where art thou has a very good and funny idea prisoners escape and go to find a treasure and for most of the film it works and is very funny but there are many parts in this film where it is obvious that the coen brothers made this movie the humor is very off at some points and the audiance that i saw this with i think aggreed with me with scenes like a bank robber shooting cows a kkk meeting and midgets all set for laughs this movie turns from very funny to very creepy i will give it about 2 out of 4 stars because some of the jokes are funny but the others are just disturbing,black_comedy
have to say that i was completely impressed by this outing by the coensi left the big lubowski somewhat disappointed in the wake of fargo but in retrospect its still a good movie  it just wasnt fargoobwat is fargo  though differently  there are thematic similarities between lubowski and o brother but the joy this movie conjures is genuinei havent felt this good about a movie since well fargothere have been some comments saying this movie is only for coen bros fans i completely disagree  this film is completely accessible from many angles  not least of which is the fact that george clooney is quite good in this  no  really good  but tim blake nelson deserves best supporting for thisim not even into deep south gospel and im thinking of buying the soundtrackcompletely excellent  wouldnt change a thing  its going into the home catalog as soon as its committed to media,black_comedy
watching the coen brothers latest is a strange experience while certainly never boring and always lovely to look at the film somehow never manages to be fully involving there are some amusing moments three great performances from the leads and a genuine feel for the mississippi of the 30s but the movie moves from one scene to the next without any omentum   i never got the feeling it was heading anywhere special just closer to the end this is a pleasant little movie that floats from your memory shortly after watching it,black_comedy
what a film this was from its commencement with the words of homer to its dynamic finish this film was an extreme departure from the mediocrity of most mainstream film today its score filled with lovely harmonies and dixieland style tunes suited the film perfectly i especially loved the song of the sirens      although the film was based upon the odyssey by homer it bore little resemblance to the original and was a delight in its own way spoilers follow john goodman with his one remaining eye was a dangerous polyphemos and of course the sirens by the riverbed and penny rather than penelope were all nods to homers epic yet what i loved about this movie was the way it built granted it was a bit slow the first half hour but once the audience realized the importance of ulysses journey and his need to reach his treasure then the interest built and built the most frightening moment by far occurred when the three convicts crashed the meeting of the secret society and beheld the unmasking of its leaders in short this movie was a definite departure from the mainstream and most definitely worth your 5 ,black_comedy
oh brother where art thou unlike the coen brothers fargo which was a meanspirited parody on dumb talking minnesotans is rather a celebration of southern culture especially the twangy folk music  instead of picking on the people of mississippi the film glorifies a slower way of life during the depression when the unhappiness and sorrow of poverty and inequality blended as naturally in song as the promise of a resurrection  taken loosely from homers odyssey  the film follows three quirky convicts who escape from a chaingang detail delmar wonderfully played by tim blake nelson is the blank face impressionable simpleton who could run to a uninvited baptism as easily as he could believe his friend had turned into a frog pete equally well acted by john turturro is the moral compass a man who sternly believes in right and wrong even if it means changing reality to fit his principles everett george clooney is the articulate agnostic universal man a champion of expediency  together they immerse themselves into a real world they are illprepared to face  the use of white is significant in three places from the mesmerized people marching to the waters to the muses by the river banks to the kkk meeting and anticipated lynching  similarly the blind man is used initially as a prophet riding singularly on the rail warning not the seek worldly treasures and then later on as a radio station owner who just happens to discover the soggy bottom boys  there are subplots too involving the escapades of george baby face nelson the governors race between an inept incumbent and his sly challenger and a fight by everett to win back his wife and five girls george cooneys versatility really shines here  the man who could take on the iraqi army and a full northeaster is just as comfortable comically acting out as one of the good ole boys  the coen brothers finally got it right in fashioning good taste around satire  in oh brother where art thou life is really a series of serendipity events in which being slowwitted becomes a virtue rather than a curse,black_comedy
fargo was okay raising arizona was okay this movie is a keeper  ive heard of homers odessy but ive never read it and homer gets credit for helping with the script  if the odessy is anything like the movie then ill have to go find it and read it  this is the best ive seen from george clooney  the 2 hour tale is only slow in a place or two and the music is intertwined  it helps to have an appreciation for some of the old gospel songs and some bluegrass,black_comedy
i was fascinated by this movie right from the opening scene then followed one memorable scene after another hopping the train the authorities and one of the most erotic temptation scene in recent memory  though everybody keeps their clothes on the movie is somewhat lowkey and moderately paced but combines the real with the surreal the sad with the funny and the sarcastic with the human touch and joy the plot seems to play a secondary role here but who cares i must admit i was surprised to see mr clooney actually act and not jut being a pretty face as for the coen regulars  theyre wonderful as everthis is absolutely one of the coens greatest excellent acting witty dialogues great cinematography and a delicious soundtrack could you ask for more,black_comedy
having gone through a horrid dry spell for good movies recently which hit rock bottom when i found myself out of desperation watching vertical limit the coen brothers have come through once again and have they everlet me start by stating that im biased  about 4 months ago i fell in with a few fellows playing old time music so its been on my mind lately and what made this movie for me was definitely the music the obvious hit is the soggy bottom boys doing i am a man of constant sorrow but the high points for me were the baptists singing down to the river to pray the siren song and ralph stanley providing the voice for o death the presence of jerry douglas on dobro in a few scenes aint too shabby neither for a fan of old timemountain music this movie is like a shot of heroin  you will be back again and againbut even without the music the movie features that coen bros touch a little bit odd without descending into overt weirdness and somehow true to life  there were some truly hilarious moments and moments of such beauty that i was shakeni have only one complaint that i can make about this movie and its a petty one during some of the musical numbers you could clearly hear instruments being played that werent being lipsynced onscreen and sometimes the lipsyncing was a bit off however that didnt bother me enough to keep me from giving this flick a welldeserved 10,black_comedy
i went into this movie not expecting much but i was very very surprised this is an excellent movie hysterically funny in some areas yet managing to clearly get its message across  and to those critics who complained about this movie being too simple for the coen brothers get over yourselves this is a great movie and apparently you cant appreciate the simplicity that can be found in the craft that you failed at and therefore critique,black_comedy
i didnt really want to write a review about o brother where art thou its been a while since ive written one for imdb but i was looking at some of the other comments written here and i felt nessesarry that i should state my opinion and back it upi just saw o brother where art thou and naturally i logged online and went to give it a rating i gave it a 9 out of 10 the movie is about a chain gang who escapes under the leadership of ulysses everett mcgill george clooney who has told the others chained to him pete and delmar john turturro and tim blake nelson that he is on his way to get 12 million dollars of buried treasure the film follows their crazy antics the range of different people they meet to even a runin with the kkk the movie has a few sideplots pappy odaniel charles durning the governer running for reelection and his opponent homer stokes wayne duvall these stories intertwine with that of our gang the politics intertwine with a song the gang recorded to make a few bucks under the name of soggy bottom boys which unknown to the group is climbing high in popularitythe movie is very clean no poor tasteless jokes you could almost call it an adventure movie 3 adventurers and their humorous experiences i highly recommend it although it ends without a true resolve it still is well written well acted and of course i have to say it well directed i enjoyed this movie thoroughly and reccomend it to all,black_comedy
was this supposed to be a comedy  let me clarify  was this supposed to be a comedy in the vein of the crap hollywood churns out these days id say no   it was an indescribably brilliant coen brothers flick with many funny moments many poignant moments some sad moments some huh moments and some i dont even know what youd call them momentsif you are looking for a typical brainless hollywood comedy dont see this for it will surely disappoint you  go see dude wheres my car have funif you appreciate originality unpredictability and the coen brothers then run dont walk to see o brother where art thou  even if you havent read the odyssey,black_comedy
a hell of a ridecoen brothers pushing the cinematic envelope once againthey aint making fun of rubes  they love them one and allthis flick will be enjoyed for centuries,black_comedy
i am and have been a big admirer of the coen brothers so i guess i approached this one with not a little expectation i was a little disappointed when the lights came on at the cinema because i just felt that this was not up to coen par maybe if i had never seen a coen movie before this one i would have felt that it was better than i think it now just as if i had seen to kill a mockingbird the film before i read the novel i would not have such scorn for the film interesting point to debateas much as i laughed with this film it was somewhat mindless something shallow and hollow i felt like thinking is this it when it was finished because somehow i was still waiting on the punchline on the wicked offbeat humour the brothers have supplied in some of their previous filmsdont get me wrong this is not a bad movie its just not as great as reading these reviews reading critics reviews and seeing the standards on their other films would have you to believe maybe if i go and see it again i might get something out of it from the second viewing maybe if i tried to really think about it something would appear in terms of meaning it is hard for me to believe or accept that a coen brother film could be so mindless,black_comedy
what a movie i saw it at the film by the sea festival and fell in love with it it starts with a black screen while hearing a song one might instantly recognise a chaingang song and is we get a picture it is a chaingang singing and hitting rocks the picture looks authentic a bit vague the mood is set and that is what this movie was to me a good mood i loved the soundtrack and i wish and i hope that it will be available i  as america in the movie was crazy about the song of the soggy bottom boys if anyone knows where i can find it and if there was an original by whom it was drop me a line,black_comedy
if nothing else this film proves just how shortchanged weve been by the music industry since about 1985 or so when i was told the film relies on numerous american musical numbers from the 1930s i was expecting to spend a lot of time squirming in my seat from sheer agony surprisingly i almost felt compelled to sing along with whomever dubbed the vocals a radical difference compared to the mood that the crappy synthetic drummachine garbage of such films as the corruptor and the replacement killers puts me in if i could put the music of this film in the same boat as one that is set in modern times itd be desperado the reliance upon musical talent rather than trendiness to sell this component of the film works well in its overall favourthat is not to say the films only plus is the music the cinematography is beautiful and it will teach you why television screens are being made wider with the advent of digital television if anyone tries to tell the distributor they want a panned and scanned version of this film im going to kick their butts into the middle of the 22nd century even when there is nothing going on outside of the central focus of the shot the wide sweeping plains of 1930s america keep ones eyes focused upon the entire picture not just whomever happens to be speaking this is why 16x9 enhanced dvd is the only way to view filmsgeorge clooney is delightful in his role as ulysses everett mcgill while john turturro and tim blake nelson provide wonderful comic fodder in their roles chris thomas king is delightful as tommy johnson the guitarist who sold his soul to the devil at the crossroads their recording session was delightful to sit through and it is a hilarious reflection on the times that they could cut a record while on the run and then travel across the state blissfully unaware that they have a number one record on their hands contrast this with modern pop stars who cant get enough of themselves or their record companys attempts to make them out to be the greatest thing since sliced bread there is a moral to this part of the story truly good music only needs word of mouth to make people want to listen to itoh and the sirens scene now that was worth watching the entire film for even if it was quite bizarre in five minutes we have a more pleasant image to look at than the entirety of sirens the meandering not to mention ugly film of norman lindsays story that was filmed not far from where i live i thoroughly recommend this film it succeeded in entertaining me beyond my most generous expectations,black_comedy
i really really wanted to love this move  but i didnt  when i realized i had gotten to the end it felt as though i had stepped out from the movie for a good half hour and came back in time for the end  poof it was done i adored the acting the wit perfectly chosen soundtrack the stunning cinematography  very clever idea of creating a hillbilly odyssey  almost worked for me but the momentum within this little world was forced to get to an end and i felt that i was missing a big chunkyea i love these filmmakers too  but it was a whole lot of very clever plateau as far as story goes gonna have to brand it with the horrible stamp of renter,black_comedy
this was one of the funniest and best movies i have ever seen the coen brothers are hitting on all cylinders the writing direction acting and music are superb its not often that the audience applauds down at the local megaplex but they did tonight  the snappy dialogue could have been written by preston sturges this one is an original,black_comedy
maybe something along the lines of why o god why  would be a better title for this awful disgrace of a movie  like many other movies released in the year 2000 this pile of rubbish tries to pass itself of as entertainment  this one by means of two brilliant filmmakers whose asses have been kissed far too many times since they released my favorite movie fargo in 1996  havent reviewers heard of the saying give praise when praise is due  it means that if a movie sucks you give it a bad review no matter who made it  just because the coen brothers have made a bunch of great movies in their career it doesnt mean that they will all be masterpieces  this movie had a terrible redundant script that reiterates over and over that the main characters are 1 dumb 2 screwed 3 out of luck  after an hour this becomes what is known as annoying  enough of that lets talk about why the critics and anyone who liked this movie are wrongi have read numerous reviews all except for one almost four stars they all say that the movie has jokes some good acting and a song that carries the movie  the only difference between the good reviews and the bad one is that the bad one says that the movie is an adbomination of mankindsome factsno reviewer has gone into detail about any of their reasons for liking the filma movie carried only by a song cannot be worth four stars anyone who liked this movie is dumb this movie will be named as one of the best of alltime the people who give it that honor will not have seen the movie,black_comedy
loosely based on homers odyssey the coen brothers latest film follows the journey of three escaped convicts through the depression era deep south the hair obsessed leadergeorge clooney and his two companionsjohn turturro and tim blake nelson journey takes them through a great many startlements including sirens bank robbers the clan and the devil  the story flows along well through all these situations with the help of countless great characters and coen wit  it is probably the best movie i have seen this year and should be an automatic oscar nominee the coen brothers as always deliver the big three great writing directing and acting  clooney is at his best and even pulls off singing he is bonafied nelson and coen vet turturro are brilliant as the witless sidekicks especially nelson in fact the movie is filled with great acting at even the tiniest characters but the best character in the movie might be the music  the film is soaked with american folk music from the early 1900s  the coen brothers use it as robert altman used jazz in kansas city even if it is not your cup of tea you will find yourself considering buying the soundtrack it may not make 100 million but it is a fantastic film if you love movies this is one not to be missed,black_comedy
brillianthow can a one make a movie that is not an original story yet make it entirely originali cannot believe people that negatively review creative filmmaking almost a nonexistence in hollywood and tear this film to pieces while the postives far outweigh the negatives the coen brothers are an aquired taste that i have had since seeing blood simple years ago yes i am a fan i own all of their movies and each is getting better and betterwhile many will see similarities in george clooneys performance to nicolas cages hi mcdonough from raising arizona the two are still fresh characters that dont brandish action and suspenseful characters and gimmicky plot to carry them  john goodmans cyclops role is reminiscent of his character in barton fink even the brilliance of capturing the era was very reminiscent of millers crossing but in the end is a movie that stands very much on its own not unlike fargowhat singles out this performace and is without doubt the films best character is the music has there been a more astute soundtrack to depict a movie to it fullest in the last ten years while not a fan of satuday night fever needless to say what the music did for that film i think the closest comparison could be 2001 a space odyssey or maybe the godfatheri can only hope that this trend of filmmaking continues for many years to come making the experience of cinema the art form it should be,black_comedy
i loved the first halfhour or so the strange interruptions of the threesomes getaway the arrivals of orpheus as a black guitar player mobsters a blind prophet on the rails baptizers and sirens  their journey hits a sweet strange spot that seems uniquely american at first the film turned sour right about when big dan hit delmar across the face the totally random flatfooted slapstick reduced goodman to a caricature rather than any kind of character  at least in barton fink we got a chance to see goodmans salesman evolve  here he was all big and loud just like charles durning and john turturro at times incomprehensiblethe plot festers very quickly here and turns into a series of small episodes and effects  gags range from strange and wonderful to repulsive hanging negroes is not funny runnoft works but once wearing blackface at a klan rally is a low comic blow being a friend of the midget gets old quick torchlit mobs leading men to their electrocution are not causes for hilarity either though maybe under dubya thatll change the coens pushed the envelope off the table this timeon the other hand tim blake nelson and george clooney both are surprisingly affable their reactions to the sirens and the morning after are just precious  also i loved seeing clooneys interactions with his daughters and holly hunter hes bonafhyde  hes a suitor  what are you well ah ahm the pater familius  anybody who can say that without breaking up deserves applausethe cinematography as everyone has indicated is gorgeous evoking a feel of some bygone golden age  however at the same time this america seems more primitive lewd maybe i should head down to natchez and mississippi and see how much things have changed over the years  often i felt like o brother was a lot like some of the old musicals the screenplay and characters were weak moments and filler for great musical moments the wet brunette sirens were seductive baaaaaaabeh the chain gang was powerful ill fly away a graceful moment and even for a guy who would never listen to country i am a man of sorrow jammed  actually this film seems less a remake of the oddysey than a tribute to john landis blues brothers with an extra southern good ol boy kick thrown in  we could use more celebrity musician appearances or a goodold fashioned chase scene and the film would lift offjust like last years sweet and lowdown this is a minor film by master filmmakers  some nights i go in expecting a good time and i got just that here some lovely scenery jokes suspense and fine fine music  if you want to feel the ground quaking after the lights go up go see quills,black_comedy
being a true cineatic since my early childhood i have discovered that most films generally either move you and end up tragically or make you laugh though not move you very much therefore i have sort of begun to collect comedies that really have depth and ability to reach my innermost feelings yes i collect these movies as somewhat rare treasures and believe me this movie is really one of those treasures maybe even the crownjewel of my shrinejust taste the essential idea of it a travesty of homers ulysses located in the hot south of the united states that takes place at the beginning of the 20th century  surely this must stimulate your curiosity mustnt it three prisoners escape their captivity together they have to as they happen to be linked together by their balls and chains aiming to find the golden loot from a robbery  they bump in to the most wonderful version of the greek antique predicter of future tereisias that ive ever come across a blind black man travelling on a rail dressinafter thousands of ups and downs coping with prosperity as well as adversity the trio reaches a wellearned success  how this is done i wont reveal here but i will certainly buy the soundtrack one cant but surrender after have watched the movie on early night show i seriously contemplated to stay and watch the late night show as well this film is an irresistible adventure from start to end favourite quote hmmm o yes thatll have to be of course its pete  look at him definetely,black_comedy
i loved this movie great music great actingi am a fan of george clooney but was really surprised at how great he was in this movie ive often been disappointed by his movies before but really loved this one great sound track too i laughed my head offcontrary to a lot of other postings i thought the weakest performance was that of john goodman who had trouble with the accent and just was not very believable as the bad guy maybe thats because im not used to seeing him in that role but i really didnt like his performancethe visuals in this movie are just gorgeous and the sound track perfecti highly recommend this movie,black_comedy
once again theyve done it  the brothers cohen have pulled together the wonderful film elements that make their movies so enjoyably unique  i concur with robin kellys review with the exception of hisher musical taste  good god the writing acting especially the deadon 1930s mississippi accents directing cinematography and even the music could not have been more top notch the cohens have spun a tale thats so delightfully toldid like to call special attention to tim blake nelsons delmar the dimmestwit of the bunch  hes just brilliant,black_comedy
im a yank living in england so in a rare turn of events we received this film for some reason before my home country did usually american films arrive here 26 months after they have in the states which sucksthis is a great little film with extraordinary cinematography a wellpaced storyline which vaguely recalls the odyssey and some wonderful performances if there are any weaknesses at all it might be the marginal and obvious overacting in some cases and john turturro who i never enjoy for some reasongenerally though the performances especially clooneys are superb and wonderfully fun the music which certainly plays a large part in the story you could call this film a musical but dont let that put you off for a second is wonderful surprisingly part of this films greatest appeal is the incredible scenerysee this film and i hope you enjoy it as much as i did its great clean fun,black_comedy
forget about the odyssey think preston sturges  the coens like to take a genre and make a new movie in that vein millers crossing is a gangster movie blood simple is film noir hudsucker proxy is the wisecracking newshen comedyyeah ok the main character who looks a lot like clark gable is trying to get home in a homeric way facing obstacles and fighting monsters so he can return to his wife but thats just the broadbrush outline of the plot the reference to homer might even be sort of a joke  people know that a coen movie is a tribute to some style of film so maybe they deliberately put based on homers odyssey in the opening creditsyou might be looking for homer but what youll get is sturges  its a 1930s or 40s kind of comedytwo things impressed me at the start of the movie  theres that scene with the three convicts chained together falling out of the freight train youve seen it in the trailers or the tv ads  immediately after that they meet a blind man who predicts their future  its a funny scene followed by a framing scene  the wise old man and a blind one at that is an old storytelling technique  like something from joseph campbells explanations of the journey of the hero or maybe something from the odyssey  here and there other myths or folklore pop in a guitar player at the crossroads and a gubernatorial candidate whose theme song is you are my sunshinethe coens are creating a myth and theyre borrowing liberally from myths both ancient and modernheres what i want from a movie to transport me to a different world and to surprise me  i could go through the movie and list the parts that transported me the baptism scene was like watching mystical musical ghosts  and i love the scene where the three convicts plus the guitarist play their song  in a period of about five or ten minutes several plot lines were wrapped up  bam bam bam bam  but i wont spoil the plot for anyone who might be reading thisplus theres lots of humor  its a very funny movieone thing bothered me the ku klux klan part  yeah i know the kkk are the bad guys but theyre just so obviously bad  its like putting nazis in a cartoonish movie like indiana jones  the minor character who decided to be antikkk was basically a jerk  however maybe thats part of mythmaking you insert a character like the devil the audience will automatically hateoverall its a huge thumbs up  not as good as millers crossing or fargo but definitely worth seeingthe coen brothers have made another great movietoddh,black_comedy
this is the best film that i have seen in a year  it is a loose very loose retelling of the odyssey set in depressionera mississippi  the art direction and photography are excellent creating a very convincing backdrop to the tale   the script moves along briskly without being rushed  every scene serves a purpose   the music primarily oldtime folk and gospel songs performed by contemporary artists is completely delightful   my wife purchased the soundtrack cd the next day   the acting is loopy and great as is often the case in coen films   here is the proof that traditional films do not have to look for the lowest common denominator to entertain,black_comedy
i think that many viewers including rodger ebert are not seeing this film in the intended context this is a comedy a silly one too yes it is based on the oddysey but it is not a dramatic epic that will blow you away with meaning its creative and brilliantly filmed the characters are creative in every way from the way they talk to how they dress the movie is spiked with perfect music to add color in my opinion this is a good film and a good coen brothers film,black_comedy
the odyssey as written by the brothers coen  whod have thunk itsurprisingly they do a very good job of it  english and mythology buffs may spend time arguing about whether the cow traditionally heras symbol meant more than that or notbut from the point of view of someone who just wanted an entertaining evening the movie quite surpassed expectations  it was funny active without too many buildings being blown up and had enough of a quest feel to it to keep it interesting  can you believe the movie even makes a klan meeting not only funny but also a part of the odyssey storylinethe acting was excellent  even holly hunter not usually one of my favorite actresses  and clooney and turturro really make the movie wonderful,black_comedy
several months ago i was wondering what the coen brothers might be up to i figured they must be working on something well this is it and oh brother it was worth the waitthe performances are terrific ive never disliked george clooney but id never seen anything to really make me a fan until now the details he brings to the character in o brother are wonderful the cast of coen repeaters joining him is a real treatthis effort is not as rapidfire as hudsucker but the barn scene in particular put me in mind of some of the faced paced stuff from raising arizona the music in o brother both incidental and source is integral to the mood of the film ill be looking for the soundtrack tomorrowif youre a fan of the coen brothers you will not be disappointed by o brother i am a fan and can recommend it very strongly,black_comedy
this movie is not for everyone  i loved it  it even makes up for the big lebowski  you have to have a certain love of the absurd to truly appreciate it  about 13 of the screening crowd i saw it with laughed uproariously in the right places the other 23s were looking like they were on the outside of an inside jokethe story is very loosely based upon the odyssey by homer  id describe it as the odyssey meets time bandits without the short people  its about three escaped prisoners  two of which are few fries short of a happy meal  who stumble across an interesting cast of characters while trying to recover a fortune from an armored car robberyi thought john goodman was great as big dan teague cyclops  he plays it absolutely straight with no hint of the absurdity of his proposition george clooney displayed admirable comic and possibly singing skills  i still dont know if they dubbed in someone elses voice for the songs charles durning again proved himself as one of hollywoods most versatile character actors  my only disappointment was with holly hunters part she didnt get enough material with which to workhighly recommended for those with an offkilter sense of humor  everyone else go see what women want,black_comedy
the coens have done it again a brilliantly original and entertaining film that brings out three wonderfully comical performances from clooney turturro  nelson the best being george clooney whose facial expressions and hilarious delivery of the unique and classic coen brothers dialogue was just brilliant in itselfthe cast supporting cast direction dialogue and wonderful storytelling and scenery made for a totally enjoyable moviealso kudos to mrclooney for doing a damn fine chicken dance,black_comedy
many of the criticisms of this movie i think are trying to put o brother into the same mold of the previous coen brother movies and that is a mistake this is a warm entertaining film that actually has something to take out of the theater and think about basing the story on homers odyssey is thought provoking and refreshing not trite at all i agree that george clooneys performance was surprising and quite good the music is wonderful and a nice change from the jan hammer music styles we hear all too often overall i think this is a great movie experience and one that has something for everybody,black_comedy
when i entered the cinema i was slightly nervous  this is because1 it was my turn to pick the film2 i had not read homers odyssey and3 i was accompanied by relatives who were more accustomed to the usual hollywoodstyle film like the klumps and charlies angelsi picked o brother where art thou on the strength of george clooney and the coen brothers  sadly my apprehension had good causethis is a film brimming with high points  the music characterisations acting and the humour all add to this solid piece of workunfortunately there is one downfall to this film  pacing  time after time i felt myself squirming in my seat waiting for something to happenthe film is set in the farmladen south an area where not much happens in a day  that doesnt mean that we have to be subjected to repeated standing on the side of the road as the world goes by scenesthis is an entertaining film  it would have been more enjoyable though if it was done in half the time,black_comedy
staggeringly we in the uk have this much anticipated picture a full three months ahead of the us presumably because of the english production company working title  how rare is thisthe depressionera pic about three escapees from a chain gang george clooney john turturro tim blake nelson is loosely based on homers odyssey  although the coens say they havent read it  and chronicles the protagonists journey across mississippi ostensibly towards clooneys buried treasure of 1200000as offbeat and charming as you might expect the movie is very episodic with some set pieces working better than others but this is all very amusing stuff with the performers all clearly enjoying the unique opportunities the coens provide for actors in hollywood todayroger deakins panavision photography is literally breathtaking  an oscar nomination is surely in the bag there at least and elsewhere too probablyperhaps flick is too meandering at times but still a joy to behold,black_comedy
this is a superb movieim missing the words to praise it enough but if you take the words good brilliant and so on and mix them with all the positive superlatives one can imaginethen you will come close to my opinion of the movieand oh what a soundtrack not since the days of bluesbrothers have i heard the like the photo is beautiful and all the actors are great and i must salute the coen brothers for this onei have never been a fan of their movies but this one took me to new levels of movieentertainment and as to the homer bit of this movieits is very well covered under the general happenings but once and again you will spot the connections and you cant stop smiling at their geniusmany many thanks for this movie coenbrothers10 out of 10,black_comedy
three prisoners from a chain gang make an escape  it seems that one of them has four days to retrieve his stash from a bank robbery before a government damn project floods it over  this movie is set in the middle of the depression in the deep south where it is apparently pretty easy to escape from a chain gang  the three prisoners are wonderfully portrayed by george clooney john torturro and tim blake nelson  each of them present us with likeable goofball characters who are recognizably american yet arent cliches   anyone who remembers larry his brother darryl and his other brother darryl will nod with recognition at these threeon their travels to retrieve the treasure they meet up with many colorful characters and work their way out of several tight spots  some of the people they meet are ordinary people trying to get by during one of americas most hardest times  others they meet with are legendary mythical or even apocryphal  the makers of the movie acknowledge homers odyssey as their main source of inspiration  they even meet up with a rascally scalawag or twoas with any coen brothers movie the characters in this movie are unique and indelible  the movies plot twists and turns its way into and out of one seemingly insurmountable scrape after another  its a marvel to watch how these characters writhe their way out of each situationi saw this right after rewatching the big lebowski and it does suffer a little by comparison  some of the situations in o brother are a little anachronistic and the dialogue seems slightly less sharp  on the other hand the photography is beautiful invoking nostalgic images of a simpler more rural time  this movie is a pleasure to watch especially in this particular year of a seemingly endless string of bad movies and i recommend it highly,black_comedy
just saw this movie yesterday and i have to say it was remarkable george clooney was finally allowed to actually spread his wings and act he was fantastic and had a wonderful supporting cast the storyline was funny entertaining and it kept me interested and it did something all good movies doit showed me something i havent seen before it was beautifully filmed and the characters were great it also had a wonderful soundrack as you can tell i have nothing but good things to say about this moviego see it,black_comedy
i am sitting here shaking my head blood simple millers crossing barton fink fargo big lebowski and now this  so much imagination being possessed by only two should be outlawedunwatchable  ill show you unwatchable  gladiator dud charlies angels stinker  mi2 how exciting  a sequel worse than jaws 2 blair witch project a great cure for insomniaill admit to being partially biased to the coens having seen everything that theyve put out and devoured it at least 5 times over  however ill also admit to being apprehensive going into this movie based on the comments i had read both on this board and from criticswell within 2 minutes of this film beginning i was taken in in short the coens have made the most imaginative story told this year with the best performances of the year  clooney is turning into a very interesting actor following his turns in three kings and out sight john turturro is excellent as always and as for tim blakenelson where did he come from  holly hunter john goodman stephen root charles durning and co also provide excellent suupportit was also great to see it in a packed cinema with everyone enjoying themselvesmy only gripe  no steve buscemi  maybe next timeperhaps if the coens had loftier intentions they might find themselves having the critics and public salivating over them ie like the mindless drivel of saving private ryan they should be admired for having the guts to go their own way not just churning out another hollywood feel good story  as long as these lads along with the likes of pt anderson spike jonze and david fincher keep challenging us there may be something that the hollywood studios may never corrupt  the imaginationroll the dice boys  im ready to play again,black_comedy
having never seen a coen brothers film before but having never heard a single negative comment about them this film was both refreshing and engaging from the fabulous gospel and bluegrass soundtrack to the witty and clever adaptation of homers odyssey to the fine acting from the entire cast this movie was superbly crafted and as a result extremely enjoyable in every regard the pacing in particular was very well done i especially loved the delivery of the clever but subtle dialogue clooneys character and his portrayal are gems i am happy to give it nine out of ten now that ive reread how many superlatives ive written,black_comedy
this is an excellent film for a variety of reasons1  the cinematography is breathtaking  it really captures the feel of the rural south  the sense of the humidity and the squalor is almost palpable2  the soundtrack is absolutely perfect  it blends the very best of period and contemporary oldtime southern music and the music integrates itself seamlessly with the films atmosphere and action  the music is one of the main characters in the film and supplements the authenticity of the vision as surely as the photography3  this is an american film through and through  it does not surprise me that audiences in spain or viewers in ireland did not get it im sure there are a lot of details and allusions in almodovar films that i dont understand   it is a great portrait of an america which is now gone  an america now morphed into a land of gap ads fast food and britney spears videos  that america is portrayed here not condescendingly but raucously  in the best spirit of o henry  the klan scene is more intricate than most critics suggest  the political inclinations of the grand wizard are fascinating in our postfdr polity  there will always be americans who are stupid enough to hate the south  this movie will be too rich and full for their small minds to accommodate4  the plot is described as meandering or disjointed by some critics who complain that certain characters should have been given more prominence the same critics scoff at the coen brothers claim that the film is based on the odyssey  i assume that these same critics would feel quite at home with those who made similar complaints about joyces ulysses in the 1920s  the film uses the same picaresque and episodic narrative style that homer employed in the odyssey  it uses the same juxtaposition of the mundane and the fantastic that homer used and the coens set their narrative in the same context in which homer placed his a musical one  the original odyssey is not a tightlyplotted relentlessly paced thriller  it is a narrative that takes joy in the act of storytelling itself  a film that takes joy in the act and art of filmmaking  the plot is as it should be even if it is not what hollywoodtrained pavlovian viewers want it to be5  this movie is as coen as it gets with regard to funny intelligent dialogue and visual inventiveness  the coen brothers are still as uncompromising and dedicated to their own peculiar aesthetic as ever  and as always the film is richly allusive evoking all the classic movies of the american south from birth of a nation to deliverancethis film is a triumph,black_comedy
the coen brothers have outdone themselves with o brother where art thou a thoroughly enjoyable movie that takes you back to depression era usa to follow three escaped inmates across the state looking to find a great treasuregeorge clooney does surprisingly well in his role of ulysses everett mcgill never once slipping out of character or out of accent for even a moment john turturro and tim blake nelson were perfect as pete and delmar respectively and were a joy to watch the often confused delmar has many of the finest and funniest lines in the film and seems happy to go along with everything and anything the small parts of john goodman as big dan t and michael badalucco as george babyface nelson do little more than reinforce the many references to homers odyssey but are still a welcome addition to the filmthe cinematography also deserves a mention with many wide shots of the open plains and fields of they early 1900s along with radio shacks town halls and general stores each drawing you more into the filmand finally the soundtrack absolutely brilliant i cant say enough good about this the fact that the soundtrack was more successful than the film alone says it all the pure sounds of blues bluegrass and old timey are easy on the ears i would however like to have the chance to hear clooney singing in constant sorrow himself it was dubbed even though he practiced for months perhaps a feature on the dvdoverall a film that will have you tapping your foot and crying with laughter see this film you wont be disappointed,black_comedy
there are two things you need before you see this film  one is a basic understanding of homers odyssey and two is to have seen a couple of coen brother movies  the coens have a way of looking at things that are slightly offcenter from offcenter  while parts may be slapstick silly most are more thought provoking likely to make you laugh after some time has passed this one can be even more confusing if you dont know the parallels to the odyssey that are drawn i saw this in the theater on a slow night so i was able to watch the movie and the reactions of the other patrons  about 10 got it and the rest were just confused  to the 10 good for you someone will eventually give a similar treatment to other classic works of literature  they will probably be accused of copycatting the coen idea but if they can make the books you dreaded to have to read in school as funny as the coens made the odyssey then ill be the first in line,black_comedy
the most astonishing thing to me as i read over the comments on this film is the incredible range of opinion it has elicited  people seem to react with polar opposite feelings about the same aspects of this movie which is enough to make me wonder sometimes if we all saw the same one but without dwelling on complex matters of interpretation ill just stick to the film  for whatever reason i find myself drawn to films which drastically divide audiences in their reactions and this one is no exceptioni loved it and thought it was a nice comeback from the to me goodbutuneven the big lebowski  things that are pretty safe to assert about o brother  1 it is the coens warmest most sentimental film since the hudsucker proxy 2 it continues certain recurring themesobsessions in the brothers milieu most particularly in that the plot revolves around crime often rebelliously championing the little man against the power of big money and that the film as a whole focuses very specifically on a particular time and place  i have thought at times that the coens are doing a regionbyregion survey of the greatness and lunacy of the united states but maybe i am reading way too much into their work  be that as it may here is what i loved about o brother as i saw it it did a beautiful job recreating the look and feel of a certain era that is long gone and forever lost to us nowthe depression  there is much that is terribly romantic about the 30s and never more so than here in particular the fact that hobos and bank robbers and even convicts were not widely looked upon as dangerous elements of society but rather sympathized with sometimes even admired and immortalized in song and story as folk heroes  hard luck times then had the effect of making people depend upon each other and trust each other more while reviling big money and banks by setting this film in that time and place and by making the heroes escaped convicts the coens are being at least gently subversive toward our current gilded age of vast wealth for the privileged few of the technocracy and bread and circuses for the rest of us  any doubt about this fact is erased by the use of harry mcclintocks big rock candy mountain over the opening credits arguably the quintessential outlaw folk anthem of the time that being said the film becomes a generous and hearty parable about the triumph of the flawed but noble common man over the devious manipulative and corrupt forces that seek to exploit and control him  if that is not your cup of tea then this film may be deeply unsatisfying to you  for me though it was occasion to stand up and cheer  viva la coens,black_comedy
o brother thank you for the coen brothers while most filmmakers stick to the routine love story or thriller and offer very little new to either genre joel and ethan coen have always delivered the good by lifting from the best and then giving their unique spin to thingstheir last couple of films fargo 1996 and the big lebowski 1998 were unmissable gems that received much deserved praise from the critics and public alikethe latest may not be in the same class but is certainly a lot of funit also proves that this is the year for george clooney this being the third of his most intriguing films after the perfect storm and three kingsthis movie features regular players john turturro and john goodman mixed in with all manner of bizarre goings onit also marks a wonderful return to form for holly hunter who has yet to give a bad performance and was sublime in the coens 1986 classic raising arizonathe title was inspired by a joke in preston sturges comedy sullivans travels i must confess ive never seen the film but its only a matter of time hollywood and film fans clearly love this movie and after steve martin mentioned it in lawrence kasdans grand canyon 1992 its one of those on the must see movie listpart musical comedy and fantasy it is set in depressionera deep south and follows clever dick everett clooney a man who is more concerned about his hair than anything else pete turturro and nonetoobright delmar director tim blake nelson  a band of convicts who escape from a chain gang to find hidden treasurenaturally with the coens movies things are never that easy for the movie is inspired by homers odyssey and the lads bump into all sorts of nutcases on their journey including a oneeyed bible salesman goodman and a wannabe mayoral candidate charles durningwith some excellent bluegrass music including a fine track by clooney and the soggy bottom boys this is one of the years most original movies that seems to have arrived fully formed into the worldmost flicks are rather obviously the work of special effects crews and a team of writers desperately trying to glean some magic from the subject material but this has a strange simplicity the coens have a knack of making their films look effortless but you know that behind the scenes they must have been burning the midnight oil to get every element righta special nod should also go to roger deakins for his washed out photographyit gives obwat that period feel while costume designers and set crew must have had a field day recreating an era seen all too rarely on the big screen,black_comedy
never has a movie captured my attention so quickly  never before have i gone to see a movie during the first weekend of its release  and i was not disappointed  ive always said that a great movie has to have good music other reviewers have said that the music is the star of this movie  i feel that the great cast outshines even the great music  point of note this movie has the absolute best climactic scene of any movie  everthe dvd contains a fantastic music video  its almost like watching a miniature version of the movie,black_comedy
this movie is brilliant  smart funny and sarcastic  the best role ive seen clooney play  my favorite parts is when he tells the clerk well i dont want fop godammit im a dapper dan man  although its not true to homers novel most of the major events are in there onewayoranother watch this movie you will not be disappointed,black_comedy
based on r2 dvd 103 minthough not a fan of comedy python excluded this movie was a joy to watch the coen brothers must hand pick actors for roles as all the actors seem perfect for the parts they play clooney gable look alike or what deserves a special mention he is proving to be a very versatile actorthe gags are low key but there are plenty of them the kkk gathering is a hoot and the music is like the movie surprisingly good710 well worth watching,black_comedy
for me being a great admirer of the coen brothers movies it is hard to rate this movie justly let me express it like this it is better than most other films in this world but as a coen baby its only average im afraid the two guys are getting older and losing the density of dialogue they once had in films like barton fink or millers crossing their characters are getting shallower their point is not in the characters any more only in the plot and mainly in weird atmospheric moments which they still do better than any other american director they always used fantastic technical effects to the full  photography music postproduction but in o brother they rely too much on those effects and leave the dialogue behind in barton fink  co you could at least belive that the film has a deep meaning even if it hadnt o brother is only a comedy  a most entertaining one howeverthey havent made many films maybe im being unfair and the next one will be brilliant again i mean not ordinary brilliant but coenbrilliant i hope so come on joel  ethan dont sleep keep fit,black_comedy
o brother where art thou a retelling of the odyssey but plomped in 1930s mississippi has its champions and detractors im a champion but understand what the detractors are saying one criticism is that the movie doesnt hold together that its too disjointed i agree it doesnt have a strong narrative flow but thats not much of a drawback the movie is morality play its written in crayon not with a word processor criticism two is that its not on par with the coens other work like blood simple and fargo so what its not supposed to be and the soundtrack  its one of the best in years and worth the price of a rental by itself  i found obwat a very entertaining movie and definitely worth a rental,black_comedy
guysi read a lot of comments about the lack of plot in this movieit is no ordinary movie it is a mirror of homers oddysseus i thought it was pretty obvious but i am afraid not every episode is a copy of what happened in this old greek tale even the main character played by geroge clooney is named after ulyssesthe movie then becomes interesting because it is fun to recognize the transposition of the story to the south of the first part of the centuryone bad thing though tim blake and john turturro sound perfectly southern but george clooney although acting quite decently cannot act with a southern accentbecause of this i give the movie only a 7,black_comedy
the coen brothers are visual masters  and possess a keen wit to bootthe unique feature of this movie is the way the music from the famous soundtrack is incorporated with the story its never wallpaper its never background its always in the forefront  actually being performed yet its not a cheesy musical its honest and exciting and makes the film come alive,black_comedy
a little bit of a mess and a big disappointment talented actors bluster their way through stereotypes beautiful scenery highlights the lack of a cohesive story and any promise of greatness fades faster than george clooneys accent however much like lebowski o brother has moments of sheer brilliance that make it worth a viewing  the dialogue while superficial is fun and fast and theres real chemistry between clooney john turturro and tim blake nelson  feels more like the coens had clever ideas for scenes and had to come up with a makeshift plot to string them on still the coens are entitled to a little selfindulgence for being the most consistently original and daring filmmakers working today,black_comedy
this is one of the best american films i have seen in years  and i mean not only because it is an americanmade film but it is about a part of the complex manyfaceted country we call the united states  oftentimes the south is given shortshrift in films  it is usually the scapegoat of americas sins in popular culture  but like any human thing to see the south only as backwards bigoted and uncouth is to miss the point that all places and peoples are at times and in places bigoted backwards and uncouth  it shows us that not everyone in the south was or is racist or ignorant  this film reminds us that in the midst of human lowliness one can find beautiful things the humor the music and the irony  it also reminds us that as one colleague of mine put it that the two groups of people who have most in common are the poor whites and the poor blacks and when they get together beautiful things can happen  this films is a readymade american classic and only gets better with every viewing,black_comedy
having been urged to see this movie from several friends i wasnt sure what to expect but was pleasantly surprised  more like captivated  by the story as it played out the performances were great  especially george clooney it was witty clever and a lot of fun not the least of which was trying to figure out which scenes in the movie corresponded to events in the odyssey,black_comedy
i thought that fargo was brilliant and that the big lebowski was stupid but i loved o brother to death  the music is right up my alley and george clooney surprised me with his performance the comment about his accent coming and going interested me  clooney was born in lexington kentucky and grew up in the suburbs of cincinnati so a southern accent is not entirely foreign to him  i thought he did a creditable job with itcharles durning has made a very good living playing good ol boys and he does his usual stellar job here  holly hunters character doesnt have much screen time but she definitely made the best of ityes the story is pretty silly but i rarely take anything seriously so it didnt bother me in the slightest  on the contrary i laughed more here than i have since chicken run,black_comedy
the coen brothers for me have always been hit or miss the overexcesses of millers crossing which brought to mind the much superior the glass key being balanced with the genius and beauty of a film like fargo but ive always admired their creativity and refusal to adhere to a specific genre this film is certainly original with beautiful cinematography a great score and fine performances where has tim blake nelson been all my life his performance right down to the goofy facial expressions is phenomenal what it lacks is dramatic tension and cohesiveness the vignettes follow one after another with not enough thread to bind them together as a whole the baby faced nelson story is wholly superfluousi found myself mildly amused throughout but certainly not exhilarated george clooney once again proved himself to be a solid charismatic actor with genuine star appeal but for laugh out loud zaniness give me jeff bridges as the dude any day of the week,black_comedy
i had no inkling this film existed until i saw a poster for it outside a theater i was killing time waiting for a friend so i decided that i could look at george clooney for an hour and a halfi was expecting a goofy jailbreak movie i didnt realize this was art film but art flic is was and i left the theater weirded out but strangely intriguedulysses everett mcgill is a smoothtalking fop of a prisoner who convinces two buddies to make a break with him their goal to retrieve the loot from mcgills armoredcar heist before its left at the bottom of a brandnew lake the misadventures loosely follow homers odyssey in a lush visual and musical landscape to say more would i think diminish the magic of just letting it all unfold before youi bought the soundtrack  a must since i couldnt get the music out of my head i rented obwot a few times i cant get george clooney lipsynching man of constant sorrow out of my mindwhen i spot obwot for sale im adding it to my collection this one is destined to become a classic,black_comedy
at first i wasnt enthusiastic about watching this movie  im so glad i did though  great characters great music lots of humor some great oneliners  very good movie i recommend it for all,black_comedy
i watched this on dvd three nights ago and it is still playing in my head i loved it the music the script the direction the acting charles durning in particular  everything first class it is great to see an intelligent witty beautifullycrafted movie coming out of the us,black_comedy
if previously i said about the coens that theyre the bestwellup from it would be certainly geniusesi mean what other movie makers from nowadaysespecially americanswould be presenting us with such stunning pieces based on homers odysseyclooneys character is taken after ulyssessee his nameand george surprises us pleasantly to sing better than okadventures after the prison escape of the 3 charactersalso jturturro and tim blake nelsonmusical succesas the soggy bottom boysmeeting 3 syrenesfacing the kukluxklan are amazingly narated in the very well known coen stylefranklyi remain a big lebowski fanbut this is yet another admirable and funny piece of work to remind us of the times of babyface nelsonhimself a movie characterdont miss it,black_comedy
obwat is extraordinary fun as a 1937 depressionera comic retelling of the travels of odysseus while the allusions to homer are obvious the sirens the baptist church as the lotuseaters the cyclops clooneys first name is ulysses his wife is penelope she has a suitorthe gubernatorial candidateklan wizard is named homeretc the allusions to the wizard of oz are somewhat more subtle the ohweoh chant and march at the klan meeting the klan wizard the three characters much like the lion the scarecrow and the tinman in the rescue scene clooney underwater watching objects from his life float past as dorothy does in the windstorm etcthe question of course is    why the odyssey and the wizard of oz both have main characters obsessed with getting home and the coens have built a richly layered entertainment that call upon a range of cultural allusions to make a pointby the way the movie within obwat is myrt and marge an undistinguished broadwaybackstage movie that features the three stooges singing    much like the soggy bottom boys,black_comedy
joel and ethan coen what a team i love their work oh brother is a warm cozy film that i fell in love with right away the songs a wonderful i love the time it takes place in as said a very warm movie that has everything that captures me i must seen movie,black_comedy
im a coen fan  just as a disclaimer  i love everything about this movie except for a few small points  the cinematography was breathtaking extremely reaslistic and optically orgasmic just to be silly  the use of yellow was very soothing and added an organic and antique feel to the entire movie  the music is well chosen the acting was choice it was good to see holly hunter again and the parallels with homer were well placed but not hokey  i was not too into the last 30 minutes of the movie  it appeared to me that the bros had a good hold on the movie until close to the end and were at least coerced to make for a little more tangible hollywood ending other than that i would say this movie is a very enjoyable movie one of the most enjoyable movies ive seen  very pleasing  and i would say its one to own  its nice to see a movie that appeals to so many different types of people as well  my parents even loved it  great production,black_comedy
this film bored me because it is so shallow we know next to nothing about the three main characters so when things happen to them regardless of how screwball it is who cares some flashbacks to thier childhoods would have been funny and helped the story there are really dumb scenes that fall flat and are not funny like john goodmans part and the stupid stupid thing about babyface nelson yet there are funny parts like the sirens scene and the hogwallop reunion i can think of so many funny scenes that could have been its like a ride that takes you up and then crashes and then takes you up again only to crash and burn in the end the only saving grace is the music and when near the end the soggy bottom boys start sining to a packed house that was a great scene there should have been more there could have been more insted you furrow your eyebrows at how the directors missed the mark this one belongs in the barrel with hudsucker and lebowski,black_comedy
one of the one most interesting characteristics about enjoying films is that a persons taste is entirely subjective one person may love a movie while another can completely hate it this can be applied in many cases to art films that may appease only the film connaisseur and turn off the mainstream hollywood filmgoer if ever there was one film in recent memory that this may be applied to it will be the coen brothers o brother where art thou the coen brothers will both disappoint and appease many filmgoers with this comedic tale based on homers odyssey the one suggestion i may make is that  in order for one to fully enjoy this film one must familiarize themselves with the story and then sit back and be treated to a great tale and a great treat furthermore an appreciation of the coen brothers work is also an added incentive as this brotherbrother filmmaking team have wet their beaks in a host of subjects this critics personal favourite coen film the big lebowski     in relation to their latest film and the story in which it is based on i will not pretend that i know my greek myths fact of the matter is i am planning to reread the story and view the film a second time in order to view all the insidejokes i probably missed the first time but what the eye can see without reading the story is a lush extravagant beautifully filmed story replete with great cinematography by the gifted roger deakins simply view the films opening and understand and experience just what kind of look he has given this film and as always the coens pack in as many twists and memorable scenes as ever before including a well choreographed and comedic larger than life kluklux klan scene where our heroes attempt to save their begotten friend in order to bring this story to life the coens have given george clooney the lead as he portrays the ulysses character in the odyssey story as ulysses everett mcgill a well mannered grounded individual who seeks the love of his family what is also surprising is that clooney actually plays the lead well holding the audience to his every word and greased hair as he holds the film and leads this trio of trouble on their quest for treasure joining mcgill as he escapes prison are  pete hagwallop john turturro and delmar odonnell tim blake nelson as they search for a treasure only to discover what they are really after yes the previous synopsis does sound flagrant but in a nutshell the moral is conveyed across the film in the form of witty writing and simply absolute beautiful cinematography that make this trio what they are really after     if one does appreciates a different  kind of filmmaking filled with musical moments memorable  characters and a series of misadventures that are well played out while staying truthful to the the odyssey with a series of witty cross references  you will enjoy this film if not many might find this film distasteful and tedious but i bet you will still be slapping your knees to the movies many great musical momentsgiancarlos rating 12,black_comedy
a surprisingly entertaining comedy from the coen brothers who attempt to place homers odyssey in the depressionera deep south maybe because they spend so much time focusing on getting the retelling right theres very little of the cold condescension towards the characters that mars most of their other films not that theres a whole lot of warmth either the coen brothers dont seem capable of empathizing with people and many of the characters are present only to serve as comic relief theres also a rhythm that makes the film a very pleasant ramble abetted by tbone burnetts bluesy score and roger deakins dusty deep woods photography the three convicts who escape from a chain gang and wander in search of home and family are played by tim blake nelson and john turturro both very likable and are anchored by george clooney passable but he does try the large cast also includes coen stalwarts john goodman as the cyclops holly hunter and charles durning the title is a typical coen film school injoke referencing preston sturges sullivans travels,black_comedy
a joyful imaginative treat  o brother contains some of the most memorable scenes of any film ive seen  visuals and sound track stunning  not everything works  but i guess this happens when envelopes are being pushed  but when stuff does come off  boy does it come off  just two scenes for example   down to the river  where the congregation all in white walk past our heros in the wood singing  sheer bloody magic   i wished the sound track cd used choir as in filmshame  second scene has to be the constant sorrow reprise and george clooneys dance near the end  total joy makes yur heart glad sort of stuffim not going to pretend i know my odyssey  but i will read it now  and rewatch o brotherreplete with slicked hair and a gopher on a stick,black_comedy
looking back on my freshman year of high school i probably would have enjoyed homers odyssey a sight more had it featured a character named wash hogwallop the coen brothers joel and ethan have once again busted out the big guns raising arizona fargo the big lebowski quite possibly the funniest film ever made and now o brother where art thou starring george clooney john turturro and tim blake nelson o brother is a 1920s take on the odyssey by homer albeit with wagonloads of artistic license  absconding from the chain gang to which they were sentenced for various trivial crimes ulysses everett mcgill clooney pete turturro and delmar nelson are on the trail of hidden loot from a bank heist years previous  in the tradition of joel and ethan coen they are beset on their way by sirens a cyclops the ku klux klan baptists and a young guitar player who has recently sold his soul to the devilas weve come to expect from the coens theyve thrown out all vestiges of conventional plot in favor of glorious offcenter characters  clooneys mcgill is the goofy but philosophical father figure seeming to possess an educated mind uncharacteristic of a habitual criminal  his will to live is proportional to the amount of dapper dan pomade remaining in his can  john turturro is probably best remembered for his role as jesus quintana in the big lebowski though to be fair i feel he was overlooked by the academy for his work in blockbuster videos beginners guide to the internet he adds yet another nutbar character to his repertoire with pete who at one point may or may not have been turned into a toad  delmar probably the films least memorable character was nonetheless given a healthy injection of hick charm by nelson  when it comes to supporting actors you cant go wrong with john goodman  ill give you the joy of meeting his character on your own no need to give everything away ive been waiting for weeks to use the word stupendous  it just rolls off the tongue  the soundtrack was stupendous i think ill go buy it now probably the most important thing to note about o brother is the fact that in the hands of any other filmmakers it would have been a complete disaster  the coens have mastered the art of leaving their audience unfulfilled while ensuring at the same time that their audience is content and even gratified to be feeling that way while o brother is nothing groundbreaking its a pleasant diversion from the tried and true formula  the coens undoubtedly are able to go to sleep each night knowing that theyve accomplished new things for film which is more than i can say for most directors today  o brother may not be a popcorn blockbuster  thats all right  ill even say that whether i enjoyed it or not it may not be your cup of tea  if you didnt like fargo you probably wont appreciate o brother where art thoufor fans of joel and ethan coen however there is much to be appreciated here  o brother where art thou gets ab  its no lebowski but id sure watch it again  and again  if youre a newcomer to coen fare keep this in mind  as the film opens ulysses pete and delmar come upon an old prophet  he tells them that you will find a treasure but it is not the treasure that you seek  how true,black_comedy
if you want to be entertained laugh a little enjoy slapstick and need to escape for 100 minutes then rent this movie george clooney sometimes looking like clark gable will not be nominated for any acting awards but his role wasnt very demanding the same might be said for tim blake nelson although he seemed perfect for the role this movie doesnt need a lot of analyzing it was simply good mindless fun the soundtrack will have you slapping your knees and youll be cheering when the hogwallows reprise their hit song,black_comedy
in this adaptation of the odyssey set in a honeysuckle mississippinevernever land of the thirties joel and ethan coen get to stagetheir trademark slapstick rumpuses on a more spectacular scalethan ever before where scale seemed to defeat them in thehudsucker proxy it brings out the soul here the warmestand sweetest of the coens eight features o brother requiresno further analysis than the statement that it brings great pleasurefrom its bluegrass score to the image of a blind radiostationowner nodding in time to the hillbilly heroes music to the cleverweaving of homer into the hijinx of three chaingang yokels on thelam people who describe this picture as rubebaiting and whorag on the coens for being cold and condescending andpostmodern must in their heart of hearts think that prestonsturges is unconscionably cruel to people who talk fast obrother is like a biscuit smothered in honey,black_comedy
this is a wonderful movie to watch if you ever just want to have fun loosely based on the odyssey the coen brothers spin a hilarious tale of three convicts who escape from the chain gang and go to seek the 12 million dollars that everett clooney claims he buried with some of the best lines ive heard in a long time damn were in a tight spot these men desecrated a burning cross daddy thats not our daddy our daddy was hit by a train i was not hit by a train and an unbelievable soundtrack this is the perfect movie for anyone with a sense of humor,black_comedy
this movie wasnt what i expected and i wound up enjoying it far more than i expected the nonstop humor and the surpriseaminute action were great fun all the references to the odyssey were fun especially the teasers where they led you to think one thing would happen to follow the odysseys story then gave it a twist to keep you on your toes i never expected to enjoy oldtimey music that much either all the characters were done well and you really got the impression that almost every actor in the movie was having an awful lot of funthe klan scenes seemed awfully reminiscent of the wizard of oz the ohweeoh guys etc it seemed like a deliberate referencei was also struck by the amount of racial tolerance displayed in the movie so often moviemakers paint a picture that suggests everyone in the south before the civil rights movement either was a klansman or supported the klan this movie bucks that stereotype by making the klan into a disliked lunatic fringeanyway the movie was great fun,black_comedy

okay so i waited and waited and waited to see this movie  why  im not sure  i just kept on getting something else above it i guess   that crappy thing is the movie is fantastic  does that make sense  crappy fantastic  anywayit wasnt until i sat down to watch this movie that i learnt it was adapted from homers epic poem which is brilliant in itself  and what a terrific adaptation it was  every single character that were created were wonderful and the actors that portrayed them were brilliant  george clooney especially  i really think he should stick to these off beat roles and stay far away from batman and characters similar to thatthe story itself is a tale of 3 somewhat stupid people caught in a huge amount of misadventures  this leads to a bunch of hilarity and a story line thatll keep you watching and interesteddo i even have to mention the soundtrack  i dont think so because if you seen it you know  if you havent yet you will when you do  beautiful sounds and a great use of old time songage is that a word  i dont think so oh wellfantastic movie in all aspects,black_comedy
ive already watched this film twice and plan on seeing it again its a solid piece of work that delivers great entertainment acting plot cinematography are all flawless it was easy to sit back and enjoy this oneif you enjoy hollywood blockbusters you might find o brother difficult to watch the coen bros have a keen sense of pace that keeps the plot moving without lingering on details transitions between scenes can be fast often times omitting information that you can otherwise assume very similar to raising arizona in this respectthe soundtrack is also worth noting traditional folk songs arranged by country veterans and newcomers youve probably heard most of the songs but never with such life breathed into them they are beautiful joyful sad and eerie these recordings are only available on the soundtrack so its worth the purchase even if youve never seen the film,black_comedy
the coen brothers are not for everyonethis film is their best in my opinion ok it lacks the dudes insight into life in our times but it is set in the 30s and thus before it was decreed this aggression will not stand it is more musical than the big lebowski and the film brings its hapless comic characters together to form a band they comprise three jailbirds on the run where singing on a chaingang was a way of life and their guitarist who sold his soul to the devil for the ability to playthe group coined as the soggy bottom boys in order to raise a little cash  sing into a can and sound amazing also showing clooney to be an actor of way more versatility than the brooding vampire slayer that his role in dusk til dawn encapsulated as for the singing of the river sirens well this alone is a reason to watch the film it is totally entrancing the soundtrack is in itself a musthave itemjohn goodman has a cameo in the film which is every bit as amusing as his part in lebowski more so by the brevity of his rolethe film overall is a wandering journey of imaginative storytelling at its finest it is filled with amusing quotable throwaway lines from clooney such as were in a tight spot and im not sure thats pete which tickle you gently through the adventurehollywood has a habit of turning out films filled with special effects and paper thin characters with formulated storylines o brother is filled with special characters that you grow to love with repeated viewing and a wandering storyline that is anything but formulated as for special effects they are clearly engineered by the same brains that put the big lebowski fargo and raising arizona together they are there for enhancing a story not to take it overlike them or loathe them the coen brothers are here to stay and as long as they keep making films as entertaining as o brother the film world is a better place for itdont rent it buy it and thank me after your fifth viewing,black_comedy
the siren scene is beautifully choreographed slooooooow seduction set to the voices of three real sirens emmylou harris allison krauss and gillian welch even if you didnt like the film as many people have a love hate relationship with the coen brothers you owe it to yourself to bend an ear to the soundtrack  for those of you who have already experienced the music check your local arthouse for coming down the mountian a film about the making of the oh brother soundtrack  it debuted at south by southwest film festival i believe in 2000 and was just brilliantly recieved  check it out,black_comedy
the coen brothers have to be considered one of the top filmmakers of our time theyve taken an age old story crafted a creative screenplay around it and tacked on also creative soundtrack courtesy of t bone burnett who should be nominated for a special consideration for the music the oscars should consider a special category for music that might have been performed prior to the making of the film but takes on a different life and meaning when used in the filmmaking process excellent film,black_comedy
as a fan of george clooney from er and three kings i was interested in seeing how he might be in a less sophisticated roll  i was very impressed with his comedic skills  he played very well off of his costars as well it takes someone of very special skills and abilities to portray a character of such a different personality  i have watched it twice and will probably watch it again  one thing i look for in films of this type is whether it is obvious that the actors were enjoying themselves in their roles  i can imagine them having a wonderful time during shooting  i loved it,black_comedy
living in music city usa gave me perhaps a unique reason to see this film were proud of our country music roots here  out of those same roots have grown so many branches of music including bluegrass  for the love of that high lonesome sound did i watch this film  i was not disappointed with the music presented in the film  i was further delighted that the film contained a plot warped enough to be fabulously entertaining as well  if there is one thing that soils this movies entertainment value in my opinion it is the unnecessary and nearly constant at times use of gd  the dialog was spicy enough without it and that particular word offends me  but the music the cinematography and the actors all combine to provide a movie that leaves you with that potato chip feeling of you cant do it just one time  you must see this one over and over  if for no other reason than to see george clooney do the bowlweevil rubberleg chicken dance in that long gray beard  all in all a super coen brothers effort,black_comedy
i rented this movie out of desperation i was surprised at how good it was thoroughly enjoyable offbeat with great music  i never thought much of george clooney as an actor but he played this part excellently  this is a must see movie,black_comedy
as with any movie audiences will have varying perceptions of a film but it seems as though the coen brothers films lend themselves to a greater degree of difference in opinion  o brother where art thou in a nutshell is a very smart movie about notsosmart people though that comment certainly cant incapsulate the depth of the film  that is a common thread for many of the directing teams films and it serves to show seemingly ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances  the most humorous points in fargo for myself came in points where there was no laughoutloud hilarity just subtle closeups on the strangely normal raising arizona is certainly no different for me in that facet and while i find these subtleties to be quite obvious i doubt the type of people they parody would find it nearly as enjoyable  o brother where art thou follows this trend inexplicably well with a hint less guarded humor  clooneys dialogue is quotable and hilarious at all times and this movie is wonderful,black_comedy
after a summer of trivial fair almost everything and an unusual number of movies with incredibly unsatisfying endings under suspicion the pledge this is a delightful comedy the music is wonderful the performances are exceptional especially a surprising clooney and the comedy is laugh out loud  the cohen brothers are brilliant movie makers  if your only going to watch one movie this year this is the one to pick up  how did this get so over looked at awards time  brilliant ,black_comedy

the coen brothers continue to delight me with their unusual films  it takes courage to go off the beaten track as they do and take risks  they did so on all levels with this movie offbeat casting soundtrack script and even choreography the only irritant was it could not make up its mind what kind of a movie it wanted to be and kept shifting direction and bits of violence particularly with the character played by goodman were needlessly offensive and detracted from the atmosphere i found them jolting maybe that was the intent many great turns thoughgeorge clooney as a hair obsessed fop has to be seen to be believed bravo george i am beginning to like you the coens have stated that this is based on homers odyssey  fairly loosely i would think this is a semifantasy reminiscent of the wizard of oz even to the three mismatched characters georges oz are his wife and 7 daughters  one of the riveting scenes is of the kkk at a rally mesmerizing  another is of the 3 sirens at the lake which is haunting i am a stickler for detail and editing and noticed only 6 daughters at the end of the movie  where did the 7th go  nevertheless i recommend this wonderful spellcaster a 7 out of 10,black_comedy
the title just turned me off  it shouldnt have  this was the most delightful movie of 2001  the tale was as delightful in length as raiders of the lost ark for those that can remember getting thrill by thrill because it just kept going and goingclooney does another tremendous job and isnt he just underrated anyway yes he is like tom selleck but clooney acts i will recommend this adamantly to all who have an interest in great movies this will be a classic along the lines of front page and it happened one night although it tries to be were no angelswatch and enjoy,black_comedy
this was one of the best movies that i have ever seen  i never really liked george clooney before i saw o brother but he was hilarious his acting reminded me of clark gable in one of his comedic roles maybe the mustache helped too  i was so inspired by this movie that i started reading homers odyssey rented the odyssey movie worth watching and bought the soundtrack to o brother i know i have watched it at least 10 times and every time i find something different have you made the connection to the devil as explained by tommy and the chain gang warden or how george clooney denied that god was helping them in their journey just like odysseus denied that posiedon helped him to win the trojan wars i love this movie thank you coen brothers,black_comedy
magnificant movie i am not a big george clooney fan but he john turturro and tim blake nelson were great in the film the music added to the movies greatness great appearances by john goodmantommy johnson and michael badalucco excellent writing another great job by the coen brothers their best not seeing this movie should be a crime ,black_comedy
four of my friends went to see this two married couples  three hated it and one loved it  i hadnt paid any attention to it when it came to the theaters because i dont particularly care for george clooney  with these four strong and conflicting reactions i had to see itthis has become one of my four alltime favorite movies  never mind what the other three are  i bought the dvd and my daughter and i now quote lines while we drive or over the dinner table or whenever we feel a line coming oni recommended this movie to my sister we never agree on movies  her family now watches it every friday night  i think ive seen it at least 12 times this summer and im not nearly donei reread the odyssey  the coen brother must have read it because homer calls odysseus the great tactician and everett mcgill calls himself that at one pointive learned to play hard time killing floor on the guitarthats a lot of benefits to gain from a movie  i give it 10  anybody that disagrees is just dumber n a bag o hammers,black_comedy
first time i saw it i thought it was ok  not as good as lebowski  i watched it again it got better and then again and then again  it grows on you  now i cant wait to see it again i missed a lot of the humor the first couple times around just like lebowski  most of it is subtle   i gave the film a chance  first time i saw it maybe a 610 or 710 at best  now though im giving it a solid 910  its awesome wes mass communicatin oh yes its a powaful new force,black_comedy
i love this movie  noi adore it  i lurv it  i love this movie so much that mere words can not accurately describe fun strange hilarious amusing and otherwise enthralling  the script the cast the music frankly its unbelievable in my estimation  and all this is coming from a true appalachian hillbilly if theres one thing i know its a good ole time and this movie is a good ole time in spades  do your ears your eyes and your heart an enormous favor and see this film you wont regret it,black_comedy
i love the coen brothers movies  the hudsucker proxy and raising arizona are two of my favorites they seem to be able to create a movie ive never seen before here the story of everett pete and delmar may be taken from homers odyssey but the three are lovingly original as they travel through mississippi during the depressionclooney has become one of my favorite actors he was great in three kings and the peacemaker he even made a respectable batman hes great here too,black_comedy
a serendipity  this film outdistanced any expectation i had  it was beautifully filmed the sepia browngold filtering classic renditions of depression folk music careful attention to costuming and the clever script and wellbalanced acting made it easy to love,black_comedy

at least the coen brothers know how to use modern technology if nobody else does  that wonderful sundrenched look is the result of an effects house digitally manipulating the original photographs to desaturate the greens  but at least there were original photographs  computer manipulation of images need not be a great crime  the manipulation here is at heart optical they could in principle have used a film with an unusual colour response  its computergenerated images that are particularly evil and the coen brothers bless them have no truck with such things  that wooden house we see at the end for instance is a model  maybe a few directors will notice how good that sequence looks maybe it will even persuade them to stop reaching for the computer animators at the first sign of difficulty like a hypochondriac reaching for the antibioticsthe coens best work since barton fink a constantly entertaining visually beguiling musically delicious film that i had great difficulty understanding  others had to explain it to me and i still dont get everything  i dont get the title for instance  it comes from sullivans travels and while i havent seen that film i know the story film director sullivan is tired of churning out shallow entertainment and sets out to make a socially aware piece of moralism that will expose the plight of the poor he plans to call it o brother where art thou  i get the reference but i dont get the joke  would sullivans film really have looked anything like thisof course not  the coens have succeeded in doing what others have merely attempted  theyve turned a twentiethcentury era into a mythical prehistoric golden age  they make it seem effortless too as though all they had to do to make the enchantment lying over the landscape visible was place a filter over their lens and turn it ninety degrees,black_comedy
a sheer delight  this coen brothers film takes wit and whimsy to a new level  one doesnt have to be a scholar of homers odyssey or even be acquainted with its framework to enjoy this retelling of a nearimpossible journey  to credit ethan coens writing solely with the movies success is irresponsible  the writing alone does not carry the movie  rather o brother where art thou sees finetuned performances from george clooney tim blake nelson and john turturro playful moodrendering cinematography easyhanded direction from joel coen and ethan coens adept recreation of homer work together as a welloiled machine  if just one of these aspects of the movie was neglected the film would have remained watchable however it would have failed to be the piece of cinematic candy that it is  highly recommended,black_comedy
this is literally the funniest movie ive ever seen all the actors were superb in their roles especially george clooney whom i never imagined could play such goofy comedy from the moment he opened his mouth the boxcar scene i fell over laughing and didnt stop until the closing credits besides humour there was sweetness pathos and drama plus the best music in a movie in years i cannot recommend this highly enough a winner,black_comedy
the coen brothers have created another enjoyable film  while definitely not their greatest work it is certainly enjoyable and is likely better than 70 of the movies being released todayloosely based on homers epic poem the odyssey o brother is the story of three inmates whove escaped from a 1920s prison chain gang in mississippi  theyre running from the law and soon meet up with several adventures as they try to regain a million stolen dollars hidden nearbydespite o brothers origins in the classics the movie is actually rather shallow  theres not a lot of character development and the plot while entertaining is somewhat thin  o brother did not set out to change the world or to tackle any important social issues  but what seems to make this movie enjoyable is a fun script combined with good oldfashioned movie makingalong with a variation of nonstandard filmmaking techniques  the coens use music and lots of it to help move the movie along  i was surprised to hear full versions of welldone folk and gospel songs  the soundtrack for this movie is wonderful and worth a separate purchase if you like folk or acoustic music  additionally the movies cinematography is effective  hues of yellow and brown fill many of the scenes and it is fitting  the colors and scenery effectively place us in a dusty 1920s mississippi setting  the coens also cleverly vary the pace of the film slow deliberate moments are followed by wellpaced action sequences  it has the effect of luring you into a scene and then cranking things up again with a new adventure  some may think that scenes are ill placed or do not fit well with the rest of the film  but to me this is the movies strength   a quirkiness  this is not standard hollywood farethe acting was fine  i wouldnt expect any awards here due to the fact that the characters were not written with any real depth  but both tim blake nelson and john turturro are hilarious as sidekicks to george clooney their characters and accents couldnt be goofiernot a great movie  but it has enough fun and enough innovation to entertain and impress,black_comedy
having read and taught homers odyssey at the university level i was thoroughly entertained by the motion picture and its clever parallels to the poem  characterizations were excellent and lip sync superb  not a lover of the depression era genre movie i was bored out of my mind when i saw the grapes of wrath at the age of 10 or so this entertaining adaptation of a greek classic enchanted me from the beginning  the ending was a little disappointing squabbling over a ring seemed too ridiculous for a woman in love but as one who prefers classical music and ordinarily despises countrywestern i was almost converted by the music in this film  each time i watch it i find somethning new and delightful jfg,black_comedy
this is one amazing film everything fits superb acting great music and the oddball of a plot i have to admit i was expecting much less but the movie turned out to be a real gem 1010,black_comedy
i love the coens humour i love most of their movies but this one left me saying hohum it was enjoyable and querky but nothing special the screenplay just seemed to wonder on without much direction redeeming moment clooneys performance the cary grant of our timeand the truly coenesque ending 510,black_comedy
i being of what i would call infantile knowledge of filmmaking have to say that this was one of the best movies i have ever seen having been recently introduced to the finer points of moviemaking and no longer satisfied with your typical commercial show this movie is exactly what i have been missing in all my years of moviegoing not having read homers oddessy i cant draw all the comparisons necessary to completely judge this movie with full merit but if the movie did nothing else it did open my eyes to a whole new world and has given me a compelling desire to read homers classic this is a movie that i could watch again and again and gleen more from it each time i watched it just recently as most people did and am excited to watch it again very soon one thing i especially like is that it is a movie that is not necessarily understood the first time you watch it the movie left me wanting more at first almost unsatisfied and yet that is what makes it so wonderful,black_comedy
sit back and enjoy it helps to have read the odyssey or at least have seen the movie before you watch this having done so i picked up on all the subtile and not so subtile references i rented obwat not knowing anything about it dont over analyze this one seeing clooney dance and sing on stage alone is worth the price of the rental i literally fell in the floor laughing i highly recommend this to anyone needing a break from reality,black_comedy
this is a sweet wacky movie with a feel not unlike the big lebowski i skipped it in theaters because of clooney but i regret that now his performance is i think even better than his work in out of sight and completely free of the mannerisms that he used in er something i was beginning to find quite irritating the plot is loosely based on the coen brothers misconception of the odyssey a book they acknowledged they had not read before making the movie but it is a harmless conceit the look is somewhat artificial due to the digital postprocessing of the film but i found that this enhanced the feel of the movie and i liked the songs,black_comedy
obwat is an excellent film but to really understand it takes repeated viewings and close study the important things to remember are that the coens claimed never to have read the odyssey before making the film although this may be a lie and that the movie is both an exercise in postmodern pastiche and an essay on theories of media and mediation this is a film that works well as a comedy particularly for movie buffs but also rewards close study with some interesting thoughts on the nature of media to dismiss it as merely a remake of the odyssey is a mistake because there is a lot more to it than that the coens put a number of characters and events in the film that seem to correspond to homers epic but they also include some things that question that correspondence in many ways the film has much more in common with robert altmans thieves like us and arthur penns bonnie and clyde than with the odyssey but beyond these more theoretical aspects of the film it is also a visually and aurally interesting film the oldtimey more postmodernismsoundtrack is terrific the camera work while less flashy than blood simple or the big lebowski is terrific and the gamble on digitally altering the color of the film really pays off as for the cows mentioned by another person who commented on this film they do suffer some abuse but the coens do give a cow the final word on george babyface nelson,black_comedy
as with most coen brothers works watching o brother is a unique and extremely entertaining experience  it is also quite hilarious and more than any of their other films jumps off from the catapult of the enchanting oldtimey music on the soundtrack  if you dont think youll enjoy a flick about a bunch of noaccount drifters bustin off a chain gang to find a fortune think again  george clooney is remarkably funny as the obtusely verbose leader of this here outfit,black_comedy
i was greatly amazed and pleased with this film  i honestly do not like george clooney but this has to be his finest performance ever  the soundtrack is a rare gem and works well with every scene in the film  i never purchase movie soundtracks but this is one that i had to have wonderful cinematography and an enjoyable although cerebral parallel to homers the odyssey  even though the film was based on that poem the work stands on its own as a wonderful romp,black_comedy
i feel a bit curmudgeonly saying this is not the best from the coen brothers because even they are streets ahead of most others very different perhaps from blood simple still their best after fargoand lebowski it has some hilarious vignettes especially the toadfrog scenesone thing though for nonamerican english speaking ears this was often very difficult to understand and they complain bitterly on here about british or australian accents in films they find hard to tune into well we couldnt understand a lot of thisswings and roundabouts i suppose,black_comedy
o brother where art thou shows us once again that the coen brothers are really top of their game with each film different from the next yet still using the same actors in different roles turturro and hunter cloony has been making a string of one good film after another out of sightthree kingsperfect storm and this is a worthy addition he preforms very well in a role competely against type if you are a coen virgin see it now and welcom yourself to their world if you are familliar with them see it and continue to be impressed,black_comedy
ive been a coen head for a while so i had high hopes of this movie certainly i enjoyed it but i found it rather disappointingsurely it wouldve been funnier to allow the viewer to discover the homeric references rather than point it out in the initial credits did joyce feel the need to preface ulysses thus im also getting tired of tired of the stereotypes of the southern moron the fumblebum with the pseudomississippi drawl charles durning as the corrupt governor cheap shots imho and way overused great camera work of course and an awesome soundtrack but just too many clichs packed into one flick the story kind of petered out after the first hour and became predictable which is not usually the case for the brothers coen heres hoping for something with a little more substance and stayingpower in the future,black_comedy
 very weak spoilers having managed various video stores i have seen many films of various types i dont regard myself as a buff but i think ive seen enough to give a valid opinion so what is it with the coen brothers obwat is a good movie at best it is not a classic or a 5 out of 5 movie as other reviews have said not necessarily on this siteit is humourous but not that funny the stylisation is excellent  the look colour and feel of the movie added to the sense of time scale and also added to the mythepic aspect of the story however my biggest moan is not the movie  as i said it was enjoyable  but with the hero worship of the coens it is not genius to take one idea and set it in another period of time done many times before it is not genius to throw famous or infamous characters of an era into a movie set at that time also done many times before i dont even think it was done that well in obwat apart from big dan having one eye and being larger than the rest filmed very well to enhance this what else was relevant to the cyclops from the odyssey it is my recollection that penelope was fending off suiters to wait for ulysses and was regretfully being forced to marry ulysses covered his ears and escaped the syrens and couldnt something else have been done with robert johnsoni recommend this movie but please dont get caught by the coen bandwagon its not hype but the admiration is too much for some of the films  this one includedps and whats with running cows over what was the point there,black_comedy
one of the best ive seen in awhile hats off to clooney turturo durning and delmartim nelson enjoy the music and humor hollywood finally put something together without violence sex and innuendo give it a 9 out of 10,black_comedy
the coen brothers seem to gave many trademarks in their films but perhaps the most obvious is that none of their characters seem truly normal everyone is incredibly unique and strange in their own way o brother where art thou may be the best example of this trademarkthe storyline is said to have been loosely based on homers the odyssey and the film and the material do have some connections such as the lotus eaters the sirens and the cyclops but most of the coen brothers unleashing some of the crazy characters and ideas they have in their headsthree convicts escape from their chain gang and being that theyre still chained together they argue over where to go ulysses george clooney in one of the years best performances promises his comrades that there is gold further off but he really just wants to get back to his wife this leads the three on an epic journey full of bizzare and comical adventuresthis is the type of film that replays itself in the viewers head long after viewing it the memorable adventures simply dont leave the mind mostly due to how unconventional they are the one i keep remembering is a hysterical encounter with babyface nelson its an incredible cinematic experience that i can see myself watching decades from now and thats why i consider it the best film of the yearo  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o,black_comedy

i really liked this film  i know i didnt get all of the odyssey references but i got enough of them  the sound track was first class the only thing i found i didnt like was the portrayal of charles durnings character pappy odaniel  this movie takes place in mississippi but hey folks pappy odaniel was a governor of texas first elected in 1938  i know that is a minor thing but if you are going to make a movie and use real historical characters get em right otherwise a very enjoyable movie,black_comedy
i took blockbuster up on their 30 movie thirty days for 20 bucks and guess what out of the 28 viewed this was the only one i wanted to see again darn good old fashioned entertaining movie  we hardly get that kind anymore coen brothers  keep up the good work  please,black_comedy
youre never sure of what youll get when you go to a coen brothers flick well maybe you are  youre going to get entertained  they do it again with o brother will someone explain the title to methe story is silly and fun and keeps a smile on your face the music is a much needed cinematic nod to a unique american sound that has been lost to so many of us the tunes fit the story perfectly and lift the movie to a level of pure enjoymentthere are lots of moments in this film that will leave you chuckling long after you see it the siren scene delmars comment good ole george right back on top again as a wildly manic babyface nelson is lead to his execution the upside down bloodhound drifting by in the flood the blind radio station owner talk about great character actors holly hunter not needing to hide her accent for the second time in her career and on and on and onfinally tim blake nelson is incredible as the sweet halfwit delmar clooney and turturro seem like easy choices for the brothers coen and both do great work here but how on earth did they find nelson hes perfect as delmar and nearly steals the movie sings a pretty mean rendition of in the jail house now to boot who knew,black_comedy
going in to another coen brothers film i was expecting a surreal masterpiece of novel characterisation and black humour  i was not disappointedi knew a little about the film but not a lot and was surprised by the opening screen explaining that it was based upon the odyssey by homer based loosely upon may have been more accurate  or even makes references to for i will freely admit that my enjoyment of and involvement in the film blinded me to the numerous parallels between the film and the original greek legend  the way the coen brothers cleverly even casually weave the references in to the film is a testament to their talent and creativity whilst i wouldnt want to spoil someones first time viewing the film its certainly an enjoyable intellectual exercise to see how many references you can findan essentially simple plot is imbued with life by fascinating characters and the diverting episodes they find themselves in  the pace is unhurried without being slow nonstop without being frantic  clooneys loquacious rogue is perfectly offset by the incessantly dim delmar and the occasionally volatile pete  although a truism to say that the writers obviously designed this trio the three actors mesh brilliantly and create an impressive onscreen triumvirate that one can easily believe in  their appearance as country and western singers has left me irritating my colleagues with a poor rendition of constant sorrow and i may just have to buy the soundtrack to show them what it should sound likea muted colour palette that is reminiscent of nostalgic american photography and glaring historical inaccuracies that i cant help find endearing serve to polish a complete and brilliant filmif you have enjoyed any other coen brothers then you will feel absolutely at home watching this one  if you havent enjoyed any other coen brothers then this is a perfect place to start,black_comedy
i actually only watched obwat because the rental store gave my wife the wrong box she wanted pay it forward and was i ever happy about that oh brother was funny sweet surprising and simply fun to watchthe only rough spots were george clooneys occational overacting yes the character was supposed to be melodramatic but it grated at times and a few times where i thought the director was spoonfeeding the audience informationthese minor potholes did nothing to deter my amusement and surprise from the first scene to the last the music was excellent not only the theme song but the entire score the story was funny the loose ties to the odyssey were interesting and i found myself rooting for the characters more than i have in a long time a simple effective movie that hollywood should pay attention to 9 out of 10,black_comedy
i said i like movies that are differentthis is definitely different  set in the 1930s three escaped convicts in the south run into misfortune around every corner  entertaining enough to see  and the cast of characters are good but nothing extra special,black_comedy
this movie was awesome it was funny without resorting to crude sexual humour and countless tasteless jokes it was one of the if not the best movies ive ever seen do yourself a big favor and rent it10 out of 10 stars,black_comedy
i just love this movie its one of the sweetest i have ever seen im a huge ethan and joel fan so i just love it this is a short comment but i cant say anything more than that i love it and its such a nice movie sofia,black_comedy
tremendous film surprising much more than i had anticipated  each actors performance is perfectly pitched to blend seamlesslyachieving both the harmonies of the foggy bottom boys and and vision of the coen brothers  a brilliant comedy,black_comedy
i thought this movie was going to be something else i dont know why but i just had this false idea of what it would be i guess i thought it would be more serious or something in either case i was happy with what i saw first of all george clooney plays a character i have never seen in him before i never could picture him being funny or anything because all of the roles i have seen him in hes pretty serious i thought he did a great job as did everyone else this movie was funny and very well made i suggest anyone see it i personally dont think you need any prior odyssey knowledge to get it910,black_comedy
 slight spoilers from looking at the cover reading the blurb watching the trailer or even hearing the soundtrack before watching the film can be quite deceptive one would imagine that from this material alone the film is not really something worth watching oh how this could not be more further from the truththe timeless story of the odyssey has been redone and set in the early era of the 20th century three escaped convicts are our guides as they take us on a ride of music drama mystery evil comedy and love in a truly human filmif you dont know the story of the odyssey then there are small sections of this film you will not be able to fully understand it is best to just take in the music and wonderful cinematography in those moments besides the somewhat required prior knowledge this film is one of the more rewarding cinema expereincesthe music is traditional old timey music of the southern american persuasion it is sometimes a little hard to get into if you have never really listend to it however as time goes by and perhaps you here it more than once you begin to enjoy it more and more certainly i was not overly impressed with the headline song man of constant sorrow when i first heard it but now i truly enjoy listening to itthe drama is first class combining tragedy evil and love as well as the human spirit in a plot that is unique and inventive some people may not notice and i dont want to spoil it but listen carefully and you may find the devil makes an appearance on a number of occasions the story is two lines of traffic meeting at the crossroads firstly the escaped convicts being chased by the law and secondly the pappy odaniel campaign for governer the low level simplicity of this plot is quite deceptive with the introduction of them sirens the big one eyed ogre of john goodman homer stokes and his little man and their big lynch mob ritual the simple plot becomes very very amusing unique and often heart warming the major point to take away is nothing is as it appears on the surface sometime if you listen and think hard enough you will notice things you would of never thought ofthe comedy is somewhat a different paradigm to the normal one liner duh duh amercian style humour you need to use your brain to understand alot of it and it is only when you really get into the story and the characters that you begin to laugh and laugh heartily the comedy can fail to suck you in but i think that is a backlash from the fact that this movie is so different to most mainstream styles of comedy if you begin watching with an open mind then you find it much more enjoyable than if you expect a certain brand of comedythe visual style is also something that is refreshing and different to other films you get the distinct impression that every single shot no matter how small has been carefully crafted and executed to perfection combined with the wonderful music you can often lose yourself in the very southern american autumn colours there are some shots that are so perfect you could print them off and frame them as legitmate first class photographic artthe final peice of this amazing artistic puzzle is the humanity of the film the slow conversations set to a guitar soundtrack about the simple things in life are truly heart warming and give these characters so much depth it makes other good films characters look like cardboard cutouts by the end of the film you truly feel for these characters their depth is only matched by their stupidity and one can wonder how they achieved so much in the film whilst still maintaining a real unintelligent persona dont fear however it is not anything like dumb and dumber this film stays well away from toilet humour and maintains its own self respect if you have been dying for strong characters of enormous depth then this movie is for youon that note i suggest you runnoft down to the video store and find out for yourself what your missing out on remember if you are not impressed with the tripe hollywood produces alomst 100 of the time this may not be the perfect answer but it is a very good refreshing enlightening change 5 stars,black_comedy
this film is a work of a genius it is so funny and is a nice break from the normal swing of things i was still laughing days after,black_comedy
what an excellent and very entertaining film one of the best i have seen in a long while kudos to the casting department for the fantastic supporting actors and hyperrealistic extras clooney should have received at least an oscar nomination for his role here i kept wondering why his accent sounded so familiar towards the end of the flick it hit me that he was doing a picture perfect impersonation of clark gable even his hair and mustache were groomed and cut like gables the cinematography is exquisite and the computer enhanced coloration gives the film a real retrospective feel if you liked the depression era feel of paper moon you will love this movie,black_comedy
this was a very funny movie george clooney is very funny as were john turturro and especially tim blake nelson as delmar the three characters run into so many mishaps in the span of less than a week that cant help but laugh george clooney was the funniest because people never saw him in a comedy and all of the large words that he misused made him very funnythis is one of my favorite movies and one of my top favorite comedies there are many different types of comedy in this film like slapstick subtlety memorable oneliners and strange situations i think that this is funnier than razing arizona but not by a very high marginso in closing this is a good family comedy if your family can handle some mild profanity 1010,black_comedy
the story is too complex for a single viewing   a classic comedy with quirky characters  it takes time to appreciate all the nuances in the movie about life and the human struggle to succeedthe hero and his followers are on the brink of success often only to be jerked back to ground zero and have to start againabounds in philosophy and wisdomlike homer intendedvery high quality,black_comedy
great fun george clooney shows a deft often deadpan touch for comedy and a dozen or so other characters are woven in and out of a tale that was amusing throughout the soundtrack alone might be worth the price of admission my 13yearold son kept right up with most of the story too and enjoyed talking about the movie afterward now that was really worth the price of admission,black_comedy
maybe you have to have read the odyssey to get much of this movie didnt seem like there was any strong plot running thru it one minute seems to be about a fortune about to be sunk in a reservoir the next about clooney and his estranged spouse getting back together then about a hick country music band  maybe i was tired but this movie dragged for me  some decent performances from the cast which served to showup gcs tvstandard actingtoo many words which he just seemed to be reading rather than livingwatch and be confused or asleep,black_comedy
its a keeper we have rented it four times and will buy it funny george clooney is great as the pretty boyhe made me laugh and was such a nice surprise to see his humor out there then there is delmar who you love right off so cute and sweet funny funny man you just want delmar for your very own friend pete was okay he fit very funny when he spotted the women could have done without john goodman no need for his part not needed baby face was a nice touchthe musicand the little girls fantastic a real good movie that you must see more then once to appreciate i have to say that delmar stole my heart,black_comedy
a truly funny movie with excellent music  a must see for anyone who enjoys bluegrass music  the cast is comprised of excellent actors who seem to work well together  i especially enjoyed the take off of the southern stereotypes  of the 1930s,black_comedy
touted as a version of homers odyssey this couldhavebeengreat film is beautifully photographed but makes no sense  forced inclusions of homers famous characters the sirens and polyphemus being the most broadly recognizable dont help prevent this oddment from ultimately failing to meet its own goal of being about well what  its the comic evolution of three men escaping from a depressionera chain gang  clooney playing the overeducated leader has some witty lines drawing their laughs from the misfit way he rambles polysyllabically sp at simple folk who neither know nor really care much what he is talking about  finally neither will you as it turns out he has no real mission  the character himself turns out to be confused despite his vocabulary even to the point of flatly ignoring the severe beating a friend receives while sitting next to him the odyssey metaphor ultimately fails too as he is not quite rewarded with his archetypes deserts gaining nothing of any great consequence in the end  see it after being john malkovich if you liked that film carter burwell who scored the latter added some music to this one too,black_comedy
if the stores were open at this hour id rush out and buy this movie then id come home and watch it again and again i allow myself to own only five moviescoen bros lebowski being one of themwhich i can return to like the sun in the morning with the knowledge that ill be entertained its the only way i substantiate paying 30 for a movie twisted i know because i plop twenties for music without blinking id name my other films but i hate subjecting myself to that employee hotpick type of pigeonholealthough id be kidding no one to say that yes my picks are rather stereotypical i enjoy dizzying rides through undulating plots without a fastened seatbelt i expect all tangibles to be perfect humor is a prono its more than that its a prerequisite hell it may be the only way to truly understand things like depression selfabsorption illegitimacy and other stluck stories about ignorant people with cruel hearts in short as i always try to be i prefer quality movies and o brother is certainly that like any skillful work of art its message is authentically ambiguous allowing each viewer to take with him or her something entirely unique for me i took a tear a laugh a few notes evenand ill take 30 to blockbuster in the morning my favorite quote comes from delmar nelson a bornagain imbecile whos excited to see a friend back on his game looks like george is right back on top again,black_comedy
george george george i thought after batman and robin you said you were going to pick your scripts more wisely first three kings now this maybe youll start picking good scripts with the next film o brother is one of the unfunniest comedies ive ever seen i think i laughed about two or three times during the whole film and was bored by the rest but there were a few things i did like stephen roots blind radio station owner clooney getting pulled out of the train john goodman charles durnings loudmouthed character the three gorgeous sirens clooney and his friends encounter and the photography of the scene itself and the scene where clooney gets beat up in the store was funny goodman is only in the film briefly but steals the scene when he is and john turturro was quite good though clooney whom i do like gave what had to be his worst performance thus far i also liked the great sense of atmosphere and the exceptional costuming which really did an incredible job of recreating the time in which the film is setbut thats about it theres not much going for it and is so slow that i found myself checking the dvd player to see how much time was left if youre a coen bros fan youll mostlikely love it if youre someone like me who likes their comedies to actually make them laugh and give you a good time then stay away oh and congratulate yourself if you can understand more than four words spoken by the blind man on the railroad cart near the beginning of the movie,black_comedy
basic premisedepression road flick cribbed from the odysseyworks pretty well enjoyed the clooney as zz top scenes good soundtrack all over always nice to see george clooney john goodman charles durning and holly hunter on hand i didnt think clooneys dialogue was the most convincingneeded more of a foghorn leghorn blowhard quality the kkk scene was quite bracing some of the scenesthe sirens for example babyface nelson seemed to stop just when they were getting goingbut you have to like its quirky easy humour the mississippi landscape the 30s vibes and the two goobers who chased after clooney right up til the cow on the barn scene very funnya unique blend hmmmmmm  outta  for the good stuff,black_comedy
this film was pleasantly surprising the concept of three idiots who escape from jail seemed like a simple idea that could be made funny if handled properlyit was funny right from the beginning moving at a quick pace it didnt take any time to be boring and show you how these three blokes met or what theyre in jail for instead it goes right to action and the humour comes thick fast and very funnywatch out for the toad scene its hillarious910  though some might find the stereotyping offensive,black_comedy
before i saw o brother where art thou i knew it was made by joel and ethan coen so i had an idea about the style the film i was about to see was going to be and i liked it i especially liked the links to the odyssey i learned about the odyssey a few years ago in high school and i recognized parts of it in the film which i found very amusing i was also quite surprised by george clooneys performance in the film its so different from the roles id seen him in before in this film he really proves that he can handle all kinds of characters a big hand of applause as well for john turturro and tim blake nelson the tree of them sometimes reminded me of the daltons,black_comedy
oh brother where art thou is great it has some elements fromhomers odyssey such as the sirens and the cyclops 1eyedbible salesman basically three men escape from prison andembark on a quest to find hidden treasure and odysses wifealong the way they encounter all kinds of entertaining subplotsthe three main characters work well together with the charismaticodysses slow and friendly delmar and the irritable petethe movie is a great vault of humor it gives everythingsarcasmsatire farce great 1liners etc definitely the funniest movie iveseen in a long timethe graphics are amazing they actually filmed the movie in a lushgreen setting but used a chemical process to change the green toa golden autumn color the effect is marvelous the wholemovieevery sceneis a work of artfinally the music there are lots of songs performed in the moviedont get me wrongit isnt a musical all of the songs arerealistically worked in and all of them are enjoyable most of themare oldies oldies to the setting of the movie so to use they areoldoldies the three main characters do a great performance ofman of sorrow i didnt know clooney could singoverall i rate this movie 95 out of 10 it is well rounded and agood for an audience of all ages i highly recommend it,black_comedy
i enjoyed this movie much more than i expected i would  the title was an awful choice for this excellent movie i have already watched the movie twice on dvd and will watch it with friends a few more times this year when ever my friends here the title they are real aprehensive about what they are in for  if you have not seen this movie it appeals to a very wide audience so chances are you will enjoy it like everyone i have watched it with,black_comedy
i went to see this film because i wanted to get out of the house i really wasnt expecting to enjoy it im not a big fan of american films and not a fan of george clooney either i usually loathe that kind of music and the thought of the south during the depression gives me the shudders but the music was great the film was very funny the kkk scene made my hair stand on end it isnt really anything like thatis it even george clooney was wonderful i dont think ive ever been so pleasantly surprised by a filmi loved it i saw it at the cinema on thursday and rented the video on saturdaywhat else can i say,black_comedy
oh brother  is this a masterpiece or what it does just what movies were meant to do  entertain its got humor action a little bit of drama scantily clad sirens bank robberies fitting music and a lot more i havent laughed so hard at a movie in a whilerating 910,black_comedy
this excellent movie is one of the greatest movie i have seen a trio of escaped convicts embarks on the adventure of a lifetime as they set out the pursue their freedom and the promise of sharing in the division of a fortune in buried treasure george clooney and more actors are great in this movie,black_comedy
when i watched this movie the first time i was unprepared and was not sure what i had just seen i watched it again and realized it is one exceptionally good show it is better than any of the 2000 blockbusters that i saw and it shows a george clooney i have never seen i loved this show it is very comical very erotic in the siren scene and has some really good old timey music i highly recommend it now i have to go look for some dapper dan pomade,black_comedy
this is perhaps the strangest version of homers odyssey i have ever seen set in the rural south of the 1930s george clooney plays the character who is just trying to get back home to his wife and daughters the wharvey gals and penny wharvey played by the three cutest kids ive ever seen on film and holly hunter who are about to be whisked away by their new daddy the odyssey is very loosely referred to throughout the film john goodman plays the cyclops a oneeyed bible salesman who mugs our hero and his friend the incredibly beautiful and erotic sirens are three luscious women washing clothes and singing by the stream and theres even some divine intervention  through it all george clooney searches for hair pomade  manages to inadvertently cut a hit record and finds himself in more tight spots than wile e coyotealthough the plot seems completely farfetched at times the humour is sophisticated and subtle even intellectual and the whole thing works to present a film which will delight you amuse you and have you talking for weeks afterward,black_comedy
even though im a fan of anything the coens do i was initially reluctant to see this movie because it was billed as a musical and im not a fan of musicals at all but i wound up being pleasantly surprised the music doesnt overwhelm at all george clooney really surprised me in this movie the guys got wonderful comic timing as do his costars john turturro and tim blake nelsonthe coens have got quite a knack for creating bizarre and quirky characters and this movies no exception i think my favorite in this movie has to be george babyface nelson the only disappointment was the ending it seemed a bit soggy pun intended,black_comedy
this film is somewhat disjointed and lacking the strong thread of a narrative which ill admit isnt always needed however it certainly had its momentsturning the kkk into something from oz was pretty funny and the bluegrass tunes were fun including george clooneys hilarious jig in one of the latter scenesbut in my opinion the effort doesnt hold a candle to prior coen brothers works especially raising arizona or fargo in the end oh brother strikes me as a string of exceedingly clever scenes only loosely bound together  with a number of coen brother regulars tacked on for good measure ie john goodman holly hunter but it was fun none the less,black_comedy
after a year of frustrating disappointments gladiator traffic erin brockovitch crouching tiger hidden dragon i finally get to see a movie a movie worthy to be best picture it figures the academy wouldnt even nominate itthis is a terrific recreation of an era every bit as impressive as titanic and la confidential  even better this is laugh out loud funny  very loosely based on the odyssey by homer this story of three dim bulb convicts escaping a chain gang to recover a treasure in depressionera mississippi boasts terrific performances great production values and much good humor  most outstanding is george clooney  as ulysses  ulysses talks smart but he is every bit as thick as his partners  he is the perfect example of starting with an incorrect premise and using perfect logic and reason to come to an incorrect conclusion  clooney well deserves his golden globe award and should have received an oscarthe coen brothers have a terrific talent for taking unfilmable material and making great movies  this movie seems closest in spirit to their near masterpiece raising arizona another live action feature length cartoon which was never tiring  part of the coenss brilliance is that they can brutally satirize their characters and communities without being condescending  they have retold the odyssey if it were told by the classically great country comedy team homer and jethro this is a movie to be enjoyed through repeat viewings far and away the best film of 2001,black_comedy
you almost have to be steeped in southernness to follow this and enjoy and appreciate it fully a southerner with some number of years of life behind him or her will pickup on the hidden nuggets a fewjimmy davis wrote you are my sunshine sometime in the thirties which is the time frame the movie is set in he was also elected governor of mississippi about 1944 i appreciate the loose connection to the governors race in the movieprobably only a southerner would recognize ricky skaggs wife playing guitar for the little girls  and her dad buck white fiddlingand then theres the connection to robert johnson  a very famous delta bluesman  standing in the crossroads  where legend has it he sold his soul to the devil for the ability to play the guitar like he could by the way the real crossroads was actually a railroad crossroadsand then theres the reform candidate being run out of town on a rail  hello ive heard it all my life  but i dont think theres a real understanding even to a southerner of what it really isit just goes on and on  get this movie learn southern pickup a copy of cliffs notes on the oddesey  you are in for a real treat,black_comedy
so its a steamy night with rain and after day of driving with a funeral    a night for which my wife chose the perfect movie the coen brothers o brother where art thou  loosely but explicitly based on the odyssey it tracks three escaped prisoners across a depressionera mississippi a land of strange magic much singing and no little amount of horroramong other things a wonderful meditation on american modernity and on how the future both displaces yet depends on the past  very southern literary theme of course but difficult to film  and ive not seen the importance of and ambiguous role played by music much of it from the south either directly or via chicago etc in defining mass modern culture so that music is both broadcast yet expected to be authentic a similarly complex role is played by water  as in the late 60s movie deliverance and in china today where the three gorges dam is planned to be the largest civil engineering project in human history a decisive role is played by government project to dam a river  deliverance was written by the southern poet  novelist james dickey concerned with such traditional southern themes  not exactly incidentally ive spent time on the headwaters of the chattooga the class ivv wild  scenic river where deliverance was filmed somebody was killed during filming if memory serves  the flooding that concerns dickey of course is mostly tva though the chattooga flows to the savannah  atlantic andis therefore outside tva authority  in brother as clooney makes clear water sweeps away the old and ushers in the new by providing hydroelectric power  but as the same scene elegantly shows this is hardly a rational processthe weather  as with most things greek one senses the power of the sun  and as with most things southern one senses the shadows the underbrush scraping on skin that seems to have been sweaty always  this movie as well as a few others ive liked recently notably crouching tiger hidden dragon and american beauty seem to me to have learned the lessons of magical realism and are now employing those lessons in a more frankly mysticalallegoricalthoughtful way  but brother does so in a way that recalls the musical  everybody can sing  if musicals were composed of spooky delta music almost all a capella sung by black and white greek choruschoirs of angels which makes sense in mississippithe movie is not perfect  george clooney as the protagonist delivers a performance that would be quite good in a lesser movie but simply doesnt match the brilliance of this movie  the romantic plot doesnt quite work  i could go on but wont bother  it is a great movieso if you havent seen it wait till a muggy afternoon calling for rain  turn off the air conditioner  do something sweaty  skip the shower and fry up something catfish if you can get them  or okra after dinner pour yourself a stiff warm whisky preferrably a coffee mug full  and enjoy,black_comedy
this was a term for a hit or success after a period of spotty effort from the period setting of this unique ecstatic satire of the american south of the early 20th century ,black_comedy
trustingly i purchased both the dvd and soundtrack without ever having viewed the film i should trust more often it now ranks among my favourites you truly get the feel of being in the south from frame one complete with a chain gang shotguntoting supervisors and a cold villainous warden every detail in this movie is beautifully accurate minus a few intentional and very forgivable anachronisms even down to the titles font a tuscan ornateesque style poster font that is true to its era not to mention the films colour effects like the sepia fades and golden overtones during the siren scene for example add a clarity and crispness to the experience that enhances it perfectly those are but a few reasons why i have such a deep respect and love for this film i would and do recommend o brother where art thou to anyone i feel deserves the honor my hat is off to all those who worked on this film,black_comedy
its just another amazing movie from the coen brothersit is that simple the cast are all superb as is the script the direction and everything else even the soundtrack and usually i dont listen to bluegrass i will watch this movie over and over againfor me this matches perfectly to my other alltime classics like pulp fiction from dusk till dawn fargo the big lebowski and el marriacci,black_comedy
i loved the film and i must see it again to catch some of the more subtle references to homers ulysses odysseus to us greeks very clever writing delightful dialogue  john goodmans cyclops was a real belly laugh and i actually began to enjoy country music  amazing,black_comedy
o brother is about what ive come to expect from those incredible coen brothers  the completely unexpected like their previous the big lebowski this movie is full of surprises utter foolishness wry humor and remarkable performances another wonderful soundtrack carefully mixed and mastered one viewing is not enough this video goes into my permanent library for pulling out again and again,black_comedy
my wife and i commented after seeing this that we should have reread the odyssey beforehand to get all of the character references but it didnt really matter that much with regard to enjoying the movie which overall we didnegatives  1  george clooneys character is very uneven  at times brilliant and at times boring  i found myself asking what happened to the fasttalking quick witted guy  2  the storyline took some leaps  after the kkk scene see below clooney et al end up at a political fundraiser or something  i didnt know why they were there or how they got there 3  lipsynching  why do directors insist on closeups when actors are lipsynching  it just makes it all the more obvious that they are not really singingpositives  there are quite a few but here are the biggest ones  1  john turturro is exceptional  oscar level performance  2  tim blake nelson is also very good  great comic timing  3  the music is great  i tapped my foot all the way through the end of the credits  i keep an ear out for soundtracks to buy and this is one on my list  4  the kkk scene is hilarious spoiler ahead  i talked myself out of believing they were ripping off the wizard of oz when the scene first started but it just kept going and going and going  no intellectual humor here just superb parody  4  dialogue  this is usually a given for coen bros films but it is particularly witty in this film although it does get a bit overtheedge at times clooneys characternot fargolevel but worth a rent,black_comedy
well  jasson cresanto another user commenter has it exactly right lotsa youse guys aint gonna get it   thats ok  the rest of us do what a movie its got everything good story twisted plot great writing gorgeous cinematography local mississippi color and strange but convincing charactors   at times i wondered what the heck is going on  others i laughed my ass off then sometimes i just sat back  marveled  the whole movie process  i am going to buy this exceptional flick  put it proudly  the top of my film stack  of which there is  last count 950 titles  loved george c he can do comedy who knew tim nelson i think stole the movie convincing me is the actors job and they all did that admirably car crasheschases stuff blowing up cookiecutter scripts summer blockbuster crap if thats what you want for sure go else where this gem leaves most other movies in its large wake see ya georgeinthegorge,black_comedy
just got finished reading the first 20 or so comments im glad the people who hated it are not in my life they are clueless im sure that if i read further i might have seen a comment noting the similarities between the ku klux klan scene and the wizard of oz spoiler the klansmans frocks their march and their song all taken from the scene at the witchs castle the color guard dragged into the bushes for their costumes etc etc anyway joel  ethan if youre listening kudos on another brilliant film,black_comedy
i first have to say that the coens have been behind some of my favorite movies of all time fargo lebowski raising arizona all are in my personal top 100 this film wanders down a somewhat different path than the aforementioned it is truly a uniquely timeless work there are not very many films that i can sit down and watch with my wife my kids and my parents all of us with differing tastes and have everyone agree afterward that they loved it from the time clooney gets pulled from the train to the final argument over the ring and even through the credits i could not quit grinning although there are not many laugh out loud momentsthe fight with goodman is onewhats goin on big dan the overall feel of the film seems to lift my spirit i also must commend the cinematographerbeautiful workthe bit involving the sirens is absolutely mesmerizing all in all a very satisfyin experience mixaphorically speakin 810,black_comedy
i have seen this movie several times now and as a white southernborn male fan of traditional music and coen brothers movies i find this movie wonderful on several levelsi saw it first with a friend who is not familiar with the coen brothers eclectic style and she loved the movie for what it is on the surface a depressionera road movie built around the plot of the odyssey with a bluestraditionalgospel soundtrack with over the top characters  we enjoyed playing seek and find with the homer references and the historical characters loosely woven into the storyon my second viewing i started focusing on the more spiritual aspects of the film as characters are baptized and damned all the while looking for answers  i listened less to the dialog and more to the music and how it compliments the action becoming almost a greek chorus of its ownonly when i had broken down some of these elements could i let the movie just wash over me  references to the wizard of oz which should have been obvious to me suddenly jumped out at me  the movie has all of the oddball humor of raising arizona i even went back to see if they got some of the same actors in each movie especially the storekeepers but they had not but is not as over the top and has more layerslike others here have commented the coen brothers movies are not for everyone  but i think o brother is more accessible at least here in the south than other entries in their catalog,black_comedy
ill start by saying i love coen brothers movies  dont think ive seen all of their movies but certainly most of them  this one is so entertaining  the three main characters are extremely well played and likeable  tim blake nelson was the only one of the three with whom i was not familiar and naturally his role turned out to be one of the funniest turturro is like a chameleon in each of his movies he just becomes who he is playing  not many stars can make the leap from tv to the big screen but it looks like george clooney may have made a successful leap  great dialogue and humor and good ole down home music  gotta see this one,black_comedy
loved it  absolutly loved it  definatly a must watch  the ending is so hilarious  youll be killin yerself laughin im not talking stupid humor im talkin old fashioned funny barbarious fun good fun  take yer family out fun  you have to see it first to see funi do say you might not understand half of it and its odyssey connection but might as well watch it you critters910,black_comedy
this film made me feel happy   i realise that it was tongueincheek but i saw a serious comment on bigotry with regard to the kkk and politics most of all i enjoyed the production and the excellent acting by all concerned  it was difficult to single out any one actor but i really enjoyed george c hamming it up for all he was worth   a change from his usual roles my friend and i laughed a great deal and i shall remember it for that reason  i did not have any difficulty with the southern accent  just had to listen carefully  another success for the brothers c,black_comedy
this movie had its perks and considering that i am one of the few females that dislikes george clooney i was surprised that i liked it as much as i did the acting in this movie was fun to watch and i would love to buy this on dvd especialy if it was a collectors edition i would give it a four stars out of five only because the scenes did drag in some places but the end was worth it john tuturro is awesome in this movie,black_comedy
let me say this first and foremost  if your movie diet consists of air force one navy seals air bud or baby geniuses you will not like this movie  if you want a movie where you can shut off your brain dont rentbuy itthat said those people with an intellect a sense of humor and a sense of cinematic taste will enjoy this film  even the music im not a big fan of bluegrass or country music was strangely compelling  there are a number of injokes for those who have read the odyssey and the acting was great going in i was hesitant about clooneybut the coen brothers have a knack for pulling out great acting from anyone  truly a great film,black_comedy
when i heard that the cohen brothers were adapting homers odessey i was excited  this is the best they can do  ugggggg well i tried to be laconic you know as mom said if you cant say anything nice but i was kicked back and told that my comment had to be a t least 4 lines there is that enough,black_comedy
the coen brothers are at the top of their craft  wacky characters brilliant photography and strange plots are all present in their latest movie  this is definitely not the movie to convert people who havent liked their previous films but fans will love it the biggest surprise for me was george clooney  those who know him only as the er guy and from a few movie rolls will be amazed at the mans comedic talents  his partners john turturro and tim blake nelson are hilarious as well and the movie has great performances from charles durning john goodman and holly hunter no commentary on this movie would be complete without mentioning the music  it is one of the best soundtracks ive ever heard truly memorable,black_comedy
this is a low key movie but i still found myself cheering for the trio of hapless escapees from a prison farm  the clever script is a mix of highlyarticulate banter and whimsical illiteracy  bravo once again to the coen brothers,black_comedy
though i knew that its gonna be a good movie i was a little skeptic about my readiness to watch such an artsy movie after a long day the movie is so much fun to watch plotwise comedy wise and the actingtim nelson as delmar odonnell is wonderful esp the toad part and john goodman was terrific not to mention clooney and torturo impressive casting i am going to buy the soundtrack of this movies needless to say the songs are good i am a man of constant sorrow is quite enjoyable,black_comedy
if you are a non native english speaking person do not attempt to watch this movie for you will completely waste your time the language is difficult if not impossible to understand therefore any humour within the dialogues is missed as a coen movies fan i was completely disappointed by this movie perhaps with subtitles it could be more enjoyable,black_comedy
this has got to be one of the best movies i have ever seen  it has a little of everything comedy action music adventure and action  normally im not a george clooney fan but he was really funny in this movie  i also found it funny that the coen brothers wrote this based on the odyssey  i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes to watch good movies,black_comedy
this movie keeps you interested throughouteverything about it is of very high quality  the filming the surprises in the plot everything  i highly recommend itespecially the ku klux klan episode and the musicralph stanleys o death is a classic,black_comedy
i have been a fan of the coen brothers work for quite some time  their style of comedy  what i call thinking mans comedy  is certainly wellrepresented by this movie  although i was not completely familiar with homers odyssey i found myself exploring it just to find the similarities to the movie and in doing so realized the true brilliance of these two brotherscertainly one of the shining stars of the movie is the music  dan tyminski gives a fabulous performance as the singing voice for george clooney as well as appearing in the movie as one of the soggy bottom boys  unfortunately many believe that clooney did his own singing so tyminski has not received his rightful credit  the soundtrack and tyminskis song man of constant sorrow remained in the top position for several weeks on the country and bluegrass charts for the record tyminski is a member of alison krauss and union station and has been since 1993the movie is funny and clever one i think most will find well worth the time to view  it takes the viewer on an outrageous journey with interesting and amusing twists and turns along the way  perhaps those more familiar with the odyssey will appreciate the genius of this movie which will without doubt go down in history as a classic coen piece,black_comedy
i had heard how good this movie was so much that i made 6 trips to the rental store over a period of two days trying to catch one of their 25 copys  i finally did get one and real excited about watching a movie that was soooo good  well i watch it and was very disappointed to be honest  it was ok but not at all great  maybe i was expecting too much,black_comedy
im amazed at how many shallow comments are here on imdb for this film everything from slow bad music to my personal favorite stereotypically racistyou people obviously didnt get it  and you never will  for those of you who enjoyed o brother read on theyve done it again  o brother is another beautifully crafted film about extremely freakish people involved in extraordinary circumstances in an odd surreal setting  these factors can be applied to all the coen bros films its what makes them fresh and enjoyable  the dialogue alone is worth the viewing  eg the conversation in the car after they pick up the guy who just sold his soul to the devili did read one comment that was very true  you either hate these films or you love them  well i love them  raising arizona will never leave my top 10  and i may have to add o brother to that esteemed list as well  9 of 10,black_comedy
i was totally amazed  nelson turturro and clooney were awesome  the script was flawless  they took totally unbelievable situations and made them totally believable  duvall and durning together made up both sides of dubya matching him to a tea  go see it over and over again,black_comedy
my favourite coen brothers film to date is the big lebowski  i thought fargo their most acclaimed movie so far was a waste of time  and thats usually the way it is with their movies  you either love em or hate em but this time with o brother i found that i dont love it or hate it i just like it  i give it a 7 out of 10 so far  i say so far because ive only watched it once and watching a coen brothers movie is like reading a kafka short storytheres so much there that you cant pick up on all of it the first time  greater appreciation comes from repeated viewings and some people will never really get it its not for the immediategratification crowd and never will be  that said having watched o brother only once my summary is this  theres virtually no narrative to the story its just a bunch of stuff that happens  therefore its not as engaging as could be had there been a stronger narrative pull and some people will think its boring there are some slow parts  but when it is funny its hilarious especially george clooneys character who cracked me up just about every time he opened his mouth  at the moment i wouldnt put it up there with the big lebowski but the laughs when they come are so strong that it easily worth the price of admissionrental,black_comedy
i chose the summary because i think o brother is the third masterpiece in a row by the coen brothers after fargo and big lebowskithough each film is different they all include great acting beautiful pictures and very interesting charactersthe humour in places is hard to take but i just could not stop laughing especially the kkk scene springs to mind i thought that i should not laugh at that but then memories of the olympic games opening came to mind and i nearly rolled on the floorthe acting throughout is amazing and it was great to see clooney in a different role not tilting his head  torturro was amazing too it was hard to recognize him at first then i knew and then it was gone again as he was living the role maybe the third unknown to me so far therefor i lack the name was maybe the best since i dont know him i hope he was acting bottom line is that o brother is an amazing film and the music fits in wonderfully i saw in the end title that the yodeling was done by someone else but was the singing by the actors yup ah thank there aint no way not gettin that sountrack disc fellerspeace song and fun roughale,black_comedy
joseph campbell couldnt have done a better popularization of this classic homeric poem the humor was especially enjoyable possibly because it was set in my native state of mississippi any lingering fears that the south shall rise again should be laid to rest by this film and the zany characters who inhabit it great film,black_comedy
an interesting film to say the least the writers and directors ethan and joel coen respectively delved into a comedic rendition of homers odyssey the film sparkles with originality which is frequently lorded over by wonderful bluegrass music i am not much of a fan of typical modern american comedy of recent films the only one which comes to mind that i did enjoy was as good as it gets i like chaplin films i like the man in the white suit which was wonderful i loved ants and shrek but i am of the opinion that most american writers and directors have little command of the subtleties which need to be in place to make a film watchable for more than one timeo brother meanders though mississippi of the 1920s with george clooney as ulysses everett mcgill john goodman as  big dan mcteague cyclops and holly hunter as penny wharvey penelope ulysses dutiful wifethe characters are brought into the 20th century with amazing wit and humour  the odyssey is a serious epic about ulysses or odysseus who set off on a voyage leaving behind his wife penelope who was continually urged to marry when everyone assumed her husband was dead and only got out of it for years by telling everyone she would marry as soon as she finished a tapestry which she unravelled every night  well penny wharvey became unravelled herself but that was the extend  there has been one other attempt at this story and that was james joyces much scandaled and longbanned novelthe film will definitely bore many americans  it is multilayered and does not have a  slam bang plotline to which so many here are accustomed regardless this is a major cinematographic work and will serve as a classic film for generations to come  the coen brothers like woody allen have gotten to a point where regardless of any box office success they produce quality entertainment offering up brilliance  and i suppose the film studios believe that one or two of these sorts of films every now and again makes them appear as though they care,black_comedy
dvdview ok so we have a mediocre plot and some good names you had better have a pot of strong coffee handy so the main character clooney likes to keep his hair pretty with pomade and hairnets and a mississippi chain gang aint the place to spend 1929 why doesnt some big time movie critic just say it this is a lousy waste of time this movie proves that everyone likes a fat pay day for as little work as possiblea mississippi chain gang is probably a more exciting and involving experience than this movie some good moments and a tongue in cheek performance by george clooney rate it a 510 stars for me glad i got it on a rent one get one free deal,black_comedy
ive never been the biggest coen bros fan although i did like hudsucker proxy fargo and loved raising arizona i was absolutely surprised and thrilled with how much i enjoyed o brother where art thou ill admit there are some weak bits but overall it was highly entertaining and very funny in a sneaky sort of way the music is used so well its a vital element yet it is used sparingly enough as to keep it from becoming a silly musical definitely not for everybody those wholike julia robertsbrad pittmel gibson et al mainstream movies will probably be very confused and hate it too bad though this film is brilliant,black_comedy
one of my favourite filmsit was visually stunning and the performances in it were all top ratethe story was fantastic with loads of great characters and the music just put the icing on the cakealthough it is a bit slow in parts it is still very good i dont want to give much away so you will just have to go and watch it,black_comedy
much too episodic and anecdotal to offer a strong narrative though it does get better as it goes along  then again i should mention that the story is based on homers the odyssey hes even credited in the opening titles updated to the depressionera deep southcostarring john turturro newcomer tim blake nelson and a very uncomfortable george clooney and holly hunter whos utterly wasted the film succeeds mainly on the level of production design cinematography and music but not much else  all coen films suceed technically the mediocre ones like this do nothing else,black_comedy
o brother where art thou2000 is a strange comedy that mixes the zanniness of the big lebowski1998 with the eccentric behavior of fargo1996  george clooney gives the best performance in his career as the main character ulysses  big dan teague played by john goodman is someone out of a flannary oconnor novel  he reminds me of the character played by ned bettey in john hustons wise blood1979  not one of the best films by the coen brothers but certainly a fun and entertaining movie to view,black_comedy
a peculiar version from the coen brothers of homers odyssey set in the depressionera deep south of the us george clooney plays ulysses everett mcgill  who escapes from a mississippi chain gang with two not oversmart buddies and encounters a blind seer and sirens not to mention various other oddities on the way to reclaiming his wife penny holly hunter and family as with most road movies this is a fairly episodic production studded with vignettes some better than others the blind radio producer played by stephen root was one of the better ones with a manner reminiscent of w c fields and there is an entertaining encounter with baby face nelson a notorious bank robber of the period who surprise surprise does not like to be called baby facegeorge clooney looking like clark gable does a good job as ulysses a very handsome but not terribly bright man obsessed with the state of his hair tim blake nelson is great as delmar his even dumber sidekickgood use is made of the southern setting  you can practically feel the heat and smell the cotton fields and its a road movie with plenty of road so to speak the whole thing is agreeably light and frothy and served up with plenty of bluegrass music its an interesting example of giving some old clichs a new twist  chain gangs evil southern cops gangsters bent southern populist politicians the klu klux klan etc a pleasant entertainment with some of fargos quirkiness without the blood and gore,black_comedy
i am of the old school brought up on laurel and hardy marx bros and gene kelly movies am only 23 this movie has as have most of the coen bros movies bought my faith back into movies with some of the rubbish being churned out by hollywood could go on for hours its nice to see something wrote directed and acted with such flare the story follows three on the run prisoners clooney best performance so far tuturro never fails to be at his best and nelson best part he could have in pursuit of a great fortune  i know a lot of people who wont go to see musical films because they automatically think of 40s style filmsbut the music in obrother ties in beautifully with each scene without slowing the film down or seeming out of place  no one just breaks into song in the middle of a sentence once again the brothers and their casting director have picked out the perfect cast and their isnt a bad actoress in attendance the one aspect that really stands out though is the filming  soaked in light the backdrops and scenery look worn and fit in perfectly with the mood and setting of the film i couldnt recommend this film any more to fans of real movies and indeed fans of hollywood trash who need to be enlightened,black_comedy
this stars clooney as a dapper dan hair obsessed prisoner who with his two dim witted sidekicks escape from prison they have a long cool journey which is loosely based on homers odyssey there are a lot of cool comedic moments but personally i didnt like the musical numbers the acting was cool and quirky and the supporting characters made the movie overall i think it was a beautiful movie but not one of the cohen brothers best ,black_comedy
this film held me spellbound from the very beginning  excellent cinematography  brilliant use of colour and image  and an offbeat but clever score  im not generally a fan of george clooney but concede that he was very good in thissee it on the big screen if you can  as with so many it just wont have the impact it needs on video,black_comedy
the most fun i have ever had at a movie  its about time i left a movie in a great mood  clooney turturro nelson are great  they all deserved nominations  some say the movie was too long but i think it was just right see this movie it is a masterpiece,black_comedy
yes its a coen film yes it has beautifully thought out characters andnear perfect dialogue no theres no real jokes thats because it hasbeautifully thought out characters and near perfect dialogue whichcreate the humour perfectly without having to resort to lampoonesquepunchlinery i had no respect for george clooney as an actor before isaw o brother now i revere him like a returning warhero of filmapparently hes in a tight spot must be that moustache,black_comedy
a brilliant witty film with excellent characters a must for filmgoers who like something which leaves a rich taste of feelgood factor long after the film has ended this film could have been a silent movie and still been a masterpiece,black_comedy
i think this one is not as good as the previous mr coens movie the plot is ok but what i find out this movie did not have any interesting part at the first half an hour what i believe is good from this script is the musical how great that mr clooney can sings in his part simply too goodbeside that i found something very different the colour of the movie change sometimes near the end maybe the projector is not good or the movie is create to be like thatone more to comment it seems that the camera has too many closeup all the things that appear on the screen looks very big eventhough i sit right at the back,black_comedy
hilarious and glorious adventure set in mississippi during the great depression about three convicts everett  george clooney pete  john turturro and delmar  tim blake nelson who escape from prison and try to stay a step ahead of their demented pursuers although theyre attached to each other in chains and search for a bundle of money that the clooney character claims to have hid from the authoritesthe coen brothers ethan and joel who are now the masters of dark comedy since director stanley kubrick passed away have certainly created another gem in o brother where art thou and the films story is based on the odyssey by homer and sullivans travels  there are plenty of bizarre and funny moments in the movie like watching kkk members dance and sing before a hanging my favorite and the convicts who run come upon three singing women sirens who are washing their clothes in the riveralso the films photographer roger deakins has done a remarkable job here in capturing the scenery and the composer tbone burnett love the name brings in a lovely mix of country and bluegrass songs  one of the bands thats appears on the soundtrack  the soggy bottom boys  actually consists of the convicts and a guitar player who sold his soul to the devil for the guitarthe best performances that stand out in the film are given not by clooney whos mocking clark gable but by nelson who has a few great oneliners and john goodman who appears as big dan teague a slithery and loud oneeyed bible salesmano brother is a real hoot,black_comedy
what can you say about a movie with such memorable linesgopher everettoh george not the livestockwe thought you was a toadhow about saying oh brother because whence came those lines the film o brother where art thou based on homers odyssey this delightful frolic takes our depressionera adventurers led by ulysses everett mcgill from the railroad to the recording studio from the chain gang to river of redemptionmy haireverett played by george clooney doing a wicked clark gable imitation leads his fellow prisoners pete john turturro and delmar the incredible tim blake nelson through the fields and furrows of the deep south in the course of their travels they meet a blind prophet petes horseeating turncoat cousin a talented black guitarist chris thomas king standing at the crossroads having sold his soul to the devil in order to learn to play the guitar hmmm wasnt there a movie called crossroads that had to do with  oh never mind a blind radio station owner who starts the boys on their singing career some incredibly hot babes read sirens who make off with pete they loved him up and turned him into a hornytoad and a oneeyed gluttonous con man read cyclops essayed by john goodmancow killeroh yes did i mention george babyface nelson who machineguns cows then makes off with a bundle in a bank robbery but gets depressed and leaves the loot with the boys and pappy odaniel the fussincussin politician then theres the encounter with the excruciating little wharvy gals and their babyfactory mother holly hunter who longs for a bona fide suitor to take care of her and her girls and a turn with the kkk which constitutes a hysterical takeoff on the march of the wicked witchs guards in the wizard of ozi dont want fop  im a dapper dan manthrough it all we have everetts obsession with pomade and hairnets delmars salvation and philosophical acceptance of the world around him shades of forest gump here and petes hapless encounter that leads to betrayal and the mysterious lawman with the bloodhound daniel von bargen who shows up in the worst places at the worst timesmost of the acting is first rate except for the wharvy gals and the story aside from a little rough language is mesmerizing the lack of academy award nominations for o brother was disappointing tim blake nelsons omission was particularly puzzling the one sour note is the cruelty to animals  though digitized and computerized it still looks all too realhowever the real star of o brother is tbone burnett the genius producer brilliant architect of bruce cockburns career who crafted the soundtrack he has pulled together some of nashvilles finest  including my favorite killer gospel group the fairfield four appearing as singing gravediggers the music weaves through the story to make a rich and colorful tapestry so tightly woven that one can barely imagine one without the other the main theme man of constant sorrow turns up in two vocal and two instrumental versions all of which rock though the radio station version with its awesome guitar is my favorite i couldnt wait to buy the soundtrack to this film and i cant wait for the film to come out on video so i can sit and watch it over and over again reciting my favorite linesstay out of the woolsworth sicoh brother what a classic,black_comedy
i thought this movie was great mainly because it is not like any other movie out there the humor is everywhere if your paying attention and not being too critical you should be laughing i like movies that actually make you laugh not make you feel like you should laugh just because its supposed to be a comedy o brother works although i did feel sorry for the cow i highly recommend this movie,black_comedy
in the past i have been weary of the coen brothers films  it cannot be denied that they are arguably the most talented film makers in hollywood today whilst also making some of the most annoying films of all time just look at the ending of the big lebowski  the first time i watched o brother i felt indifferent about it but then i watched it again and loved it  i have seen it several times since and the film keep growing on me  george cloony is great and should have got nominated for an oscar as should have the film which was easily better in my opinion than gladiator  not to mention the rest of the cast though would be a crime  john tueturro and tim blake nelson are extremely good along side cloony  this to me is easily the best film the coens have made so go see it,black_comedy
another masterpiece from the coen brothers  the big lebowski and o brother are very similar in that they take a seemingly boring story and turn it into a very entertaining and funny movie  the movie has its low points sure almost every movie does but this movie delivers good laughs through its witty dialog and the irony  the performances are excellent the music is wonderful and the cinematography is stunning  i think that this is a must watch movie but if you did not like the big lebowski you should not bother with it,black_comedy
for those who expect a movie to make complete sense and want a tidily written script which braids up all the loose ends stay away for those of you who like movies like the holy grail and transylvania 65000 you might like this one  there are anachronisms there are certainly plot holes  so what this was one of the most genuinely funny movies ive ever seen  i didnt slap my knee very many times but i smiled from the opening scene of the three running through the soy bean fields to the look on the governors face as he said arent you boys the look on delmars face carried me through the slower times  living as i do in the center of bluegrass and southern gospel music i was not raised here i loved the music i went out after the first time i saw it and bought the soundtrack the second time i saw it two days later and four days ago i saw and heard things i missed in the first  i will buy the video when it comes out and wear it out just like my other cult favorite the holy graillast bit of advice if you have to ask why its funny go to another movie its not for you,black_comedy
upon reading the various reviews on this page i cant help but notice that the overwhelming majority of negative reviews are from those reviewers who reside outside of the us considering the fact that this brilliant film is set in the depressionera south its quite understandable that most outside the us would find it difficult to appreciate or even relate to in fact id even go so far as to say that virtually any of the coen brothers films could reasonably be considered difficult to relate to by anyone who is not familiar with arizona raising arizona the upper midwest fargo or even classic american industrialism hudsucker proxy for example i liken this inherent difficulty to say the average us citizen attempting to relate to trainspotting another brilliant filmas for the film itself i will echo the comments of many of my american brothers and sisters who have reviewed o brother on this site by saying that this film is easily my favorite of 2000 there are so many great scenes in this film that its difficult to remember them all one of the scenes which is indelibly etched into my memory is the one which depicts the wizard of ozlike attempt to rescue mr johnson from the clutches of the evil kkk at a rally our heros stumble across in the middle of the woods folks if this scene didnt make you smile you need to check your pulsethe performances were simply topnotch and george clooney has given us all the evidence we need to cease dismissing him as just a television actor his performance in my mind was peerless among all american films in 2000 john turturro is always amazing and is wonderfully selective in the roles he chooses like johnny depp and brad pitt his very existence in a film lends instant credibility its no wonder hes accepted roles for four coen brothers films  the bros are simply the best in the american film business bar nonefinally the direction and cinematography in o brother were instrumental in giving this film an authentically early1900s southern us feel nothing was forced in this film for the sake of artificially creating atmosphere and mood  the coens did such a wonderful job with the direction and script that the film was able to flow perfectly without obligatory and contrived references so often seen in quasiperiod piecesi highly recommend this amazing film once again the coen brothers have expertly captured true americana like no one else,black_comedy
the coen brothers adapted a novel of homer the story plays in the 1930s its the odyssey of three guys george clooney john turturro tim blake nelson who break out of jail in mississippi and try to find the hidden treasure of a bank robbery although this is far away from the coens usual style  not cynical as fargo or the big lebowski  there is one important element of their movies the characters are no great heroes they are ordinary guys like you and i who try to stay alive in the struggles of life thats what makes them so sympathetic to me this is a lovable charming comedy lean back have some fried green tomatoes and enjoy it,black_comedy
i found this film to be a brilliant combination of musical comedy historical drama and southern gothic style but its not for everyone to really enjoy it you kind of need to like all of those things but more importantly you need to be willing to let the story wash over you like molasses and accept the cartoony characters as part of the style to warm up try watching something like midnight in the garden of good and evil i wonder if the people who complained about the lack of realism got the point at all  the entire movie is so stylized its hard to take anything literally i thought the were in a tight spot scene was a dream sequence for at least half the scene maybe that dreamlike feel more than any plot elements is what the cohens took from the odyssey speaking of which if i recall my english classes correctly that classic piece of literatures plot consisted entirely of odysseus going from place to place and encountering odd creatures so why isnt anybody berating homerbottom line i have no idea what the cohens were going for but it sure worked for me just be forewarned that it might not work for you,black_comedy
having missed this film on its limited uk theatrical run i made sure i purchased it immediately after its dvd release  i wasnt disappointed far from it  the most enjoyable film i have had the pleasure to have watched recently and although it may be considered sacrilege by coen diehards i thought it was better than fargo and lets face it that takes some beating  the story is loosely based on homers odyssey the magnificent george clooney plays ulysses everett mcgill the leader of an escaped chain gang which includes john turturro and tim blake nelson  en route to find some hidden treasure they encounter the cyclops in the form of coen stalwart john goodmans bible salesman and become embroiled in an election campaign between klan leader homer stokes and governor pappy odaniel  its surreal entertaining and by far the best film of 2000 and its such a shame that the academy and much of the public ignored it completely  clooneys performance is on a par with that in out of sight  turturro is as ever excellent and the little known nelson is surprisingly good as dimwitted delmara real treat and the musics great too  miss this at your cost,black_comedy
this movie is like being in loveyou cant stop smiling the ingenious coens have made another sweetheart of a film usually when i leave a movie this happy its a love story this is a kind of goofy buddy movie with charming unexpected performances from everybody three convicts escape have meeting with fortune tellerseer make a record get caught escape meet a famous bank robber meet beautiful women get caught escape and each escape is more poetic than the last discover that their treasure has been betrayed become a famous singing group and they dont even know itby virtue of their recordingand on and on this film is fascinating funny freedom loving and fine the directors vision with perfectionist cinematography flood the audience with golden images creating a nimbus of timeless radiancebut wait there is more the music so much fun and expertly done i have new laugh lines on my face i almost dont mind,black_comedy
it is always difficult to see what the coen brothers will come up with next always shrouded in secrecy the public have no choice but to be surprised by their next project in this case o brother where art thou does not fall shortin their latest project the coen brothers have given the film the same kind of dreamy atmosphere that was hinted at in the wonderful the big lebowski the washed out but warm colours give a very hazy feel to it all providing a loving background to the humourous situations our 3 escaped convicts find themselves inthe performances of our 3 main characters steal the show  so much so in fact that the film tends to suffer when they are not on screen although thankfully these moments are both short and rarepraise must also be given for the fantastic soundtrack i must admit i am not a big fan of country music but the songs in the film did raise more than a smile from meif you liked the coen brothers previous work or more specifically if you loved the big lebowski then you will love this however i can see that for just as many of those who will love this film there will be those who hate it but i am a great admirer of the coen brothers work and think that this film is one of last years most original and imaginative films,black_comedy
the movie is good but the soundtrack is semenhopping fantastic  youll need plenty of tissue paper for this one guys  from big rock candy mountains to in the jailhouse now youll experience one long excruciatinglypleasurable climax  the line between pain and pleasure will increasingly become blurred as you listen to this enchanting early 20th century folkgospel hoedown  dont walk run to your nearest record store youll never need another blowup doll again,black_comedy
o brother where art thou seems to be a combination of two different movies1 a hilarious ridiculous account of three escaped stumblebum convicts searching for mythical treasure2 a dull boring tedious short pastiche of southern governors and spindoctorsthe fact that the two stories collide at the end is really rather irrelevanti loved the first movie it was hilarious clever beautiful and starred george clooney in fine form john turturro and the wonderful tim blake nelsonthe second movie was as far as i could see maybe i missed the joke boring pointless and unfunny no disrespect to the actors but to the writero brother is essentially a good film if it were not for the subplot nevertheless it is bearable the first time and the three leads almost make up for it entirely making the incredible credible also the cinematography is beautiful and the plot quirks are worth an essay of praise in themselves7 out of 10dont see it at the cinema rent it on video if only for the use of the fastforward button,black_comedy
star ratingunmissablevery goodokayyou could go out for a meal insteadavoid at all coststhe ever prominent coens return to the screen with o brotherwhere art thouan oddball but perversely entertaining experience which leaves you with a diverse sense of a pleasantly twisted imaginationset in mississipi in the late 1930sit follows the trials and tribulations of a trio of escaped convicts who have the potential to make it big as a band of singerswith the assistance of a racially harassed coloured guitar playerits the weird elements of the film that make it so memorable there are many interludes involving angels singing in lakesand members of the klu klux klan doing bizzaire dance rituals that stick in the mind long afterand george clooneyjohn turturro and tim blake nelson can sing so surprisingly wellwell worth seeing,black_comedy
see this movie  best film of 2000 beautiful cinematography soundtrack writing acting you name it  the audience was actually cheering out loud and clapping at one point  wow unfortunately overlooked at oscars but do yourself a favor and see it today,black_comedy
i cant be bothered to write a full review all i can say is that i love the coen brothers movies ive seen all of their movies at least three times each many more for some all i can say is that i dont feel that any of their films are better than one another like this one i have my favourites though i just wish that they would make more and more movies cos they seem uncappable of making bad ones,black_comedy
its pretty easy to make me laugh  i still think heartbreakers was a good movie  but i have never laughed this hard in a movie theater than when i saw this movie  it is filled with insane characters  i love movies about crazy people and the people of o brother are pretty crazy  all the characters are colorful and have their own insane touches  i love love movies where every character is crazy does apocalypse now and bringing out the dead ring any bellsfirst off the movie is a little weird  not bizarre weird just awkward weird  but all coen brothers movies are a little twisted  i never liked fargo  yea you heard me  i am the one person who didnt like it ill explain why some other day  raising arizona had its laughs though it was a little too weird for me  i really liked the big labowskie and i have never seen their other stuff  but i loved o brother where art thouall of the performances in this movie are perfect  joel coen has proven to be a genius director  the cast is perfect for the roles especially george clooney  i like clooney he has that attitude and edge that most big shot actors dont have  he never seems fake to methe movie has its weak points  mostly some of the writing has its low periods  the film does keep a brisk pace throughout but there are periods where the humor dies downthis is one of my favorite films off 2000 and while it may not have deserved a nomination for bestadapted screenplay it sure does make me laugh at its insanity810,black_comedy
this was very enjoyable clooney and tuturro were great and a delight to watch but tim blake nelsons character stole the show nelson was riot  naive and lovable funny bizarre unique and i really enjoyed this movie,black_comedy
i didnt hate this movie but i didnt laugh much either i was mostly confused i guess most of the humor was lost on me i did get a kick out of the horny toad thing though all the actors did a good job the film did run about half an hour too long though what else can i say,black_comedy
what a pleasant suprise i finally got my seven bucks worth at the movies i would actually pay to see this one again it was funny smart a true gem i found it refreshingly original one of my personal top ten the title is not the best but i will not forget it,black_comedy
i have seen this movie twice and it was all for the better because i could only follow some jokes in the southern accents after having seen it before despite these difficulties i loved many sequences and my favourite scene is when john torturro is screaming in the car because he feels that there are women nearby of course the frog scene is really hilarious  yet i realized that antagonists who one can somehow still anticipate with are preferable patricia highsmith for instance even says this about her strange murderers ie mr ripley  the coen brothers choice seems another to create nasty characters who are really disgusting in my opinion this aim became too obvious but it surely did not spoil this great masterpiece with its superbe soundtrack,black_comedy
because of the generally negative response from the press andmy disappointment with such recent coen bros films as hudsucker and lebowski i went into this film with lowexpectations i was pleasantly surprised to find this my fave coenfilm since raising arizona which from me is high complementsindeed what really makes this film for me is the fact that it isutterly different than anything ive seen in a while its like thecoens were out to shoot an old warner bros depressionerapicture with their own keen sensibilities the look of the film islush and stunning and the real pleasures of the film are in thedetails and faithfulness to time and place i am glad i caught thisin the movie theatre i imagine it will lose some of its appeal on thesmall screen,black_comedy
where would we be without the coen brothers well prozac sales would be up for sure oh brother is a wonderful tale that offers up a hilarious antidote to the classic steinbeck view of 30s americathe dialogue manages to deliver wit through bathos and sharp visual humour through slapstick  no mean feat that the movie is not just buoyed along by the amazing soundtrack it is propelled by iti saw this film on a longhaul plane trip and then watched it all over again on the way back  it was even better the second time if you dont get this movie you probably dont get much at alli give homer 9 ethan and joel 10,black_comedy
i am a coen brothers fan an with this movie they didnt disappoint me another great directing with excellent acting by clooney turturro and blake nelson,black_comedy
this movie is one of my favorite movies after seeing it last tuesday it should have won the academy award for best picture although it didnt get any awards i thought it was really funny it didnt get very good reviews in my local newspapers but the imdb reports seemed pretty good 10 out of 10 stars is what i would give it,black_comedy
when the credits started to roll all i could do was smile and shake my head i truly didnt really know what to think of it  but after some thinking it truly was a good movie  a few scenes really left lasting impressions clooney dancing  the coen brothers truly do have brillant twisted minds,black_comedy
just when you think the coen brothers have reached the maximum and their next movie just cannot be better than the latest one  well they will prove you wrong o brother is so funny so unique all in story characters conversations images and allusions  it is that much fun one can impossibly walk out of the cinema without knowing that he spent a wonderful eveningthe characters of the three fugitives are that intelligently formed in their unintellectual behaviour the coens prove to be the masters of cult quotes once againjust go and enjoy the odysee,black_comedy
you have to pay pretty much attention to it if you read odysseia the poem of homer because its the best way to enjoy the movies tricks i dont want to spoil the movie because its so good so i wont tell you any clues just gosee the acting is awesome i adored clooneytim blake nelson as well as john goodman the songs are awesome too bad its not actually clooney singing it the usual coen kind of humor is awesome what can i say i loved it its a rather slow movie but it just gets you in off course if you really want to get in so you dont really mind that and i as an avid homer reader enjoyed it so much because i do like to think about and analyze the little secret things that happen in a movie and this movie as based on odysseia and passing in 30s or 40s i dont know has lots of stuff that i like highly highly highly recommended,black_comedy
since it would be unfair to rate this movie against other writerdirectors works rating it on the coen brother scale i would say this scores a definite nine  while it might not quite measure up to raising arizona it is definitely a one of there shining stars intellectually stimulating witty complete with two obvious punch line jokes to remind you where you are spiritual and visually a work of art  it aint no wrestling movie,black_comedy
1st a disclaimer if the title credits show the names joel and ethan coen it is a 10 in my book the only exception would be crimewave which is almost a 10  simply due to its marx brothers level of insanity and over the top sillinessso sublime so perfect a minuet in a world of heavy metal a meraingue in a universe of soft servethe film is seamless and yet certain images remain the ghostly baptists approaching the river the 3 weird sisters each and every scene with goodman and my favorite the burning cross that falls onto the kkk reason enough to see the film imhothe music on the soundtrack is musthear  the characters are given up as simple and exactly as good as they should be and no more nor any less,black_comedy
spoilers aheadethan and joel coen are endlessly imaginative minimalist filmmakers who suffer that paradoxically debilitating disease that attack most filmmakers who want to work on a larger scale the bigger their budget is the worse the films come out  not the nightmare that the hudsucker proxy was this time they keep their energy in check and the film buzzes along pretty smoothly  thats not the problem but the problem they are like terry gilliam and oliver stone helplessly and inevitably at the mercy of their own compulsive inventiveness  they simply cannot stop that stream of ideas that come out  they have to put it up there on the screen  its their temperament  but unlike gilliam who is a babbler and stone who is a screamer  both coens are drawlers  they seem enthralled by the infinite possibilities of shaggy dog looseness  perhaps their most successful demonstration was the big lebowski where they had the talented jeff bridges who is easygoing drifting negligence incarnate as the motor that drove the movie towards a satisfying nowhere  this time around they werent so lucky  o brother who art thou based on homers the odyssey is a chore to get through  their unrelentingly lazy pace is not helped by all those production values as well by a grossly misconceived scene at the middle of the movie where a crazy fat psychopath realistically machineguns down a cow and another gets run over with a car  when that happens the movie stops cold and no amount of the tons of talent of george clooney john turturro tim blake nelson or of the other members of the cast and no matter how funny or ingenious the filmmakers could ever get literally nobody can resurrect this movie  after that their creativeness gets oppressive,black_comedy
any new coen brothers film is a reason to get excited especially after wetting our appetites with the directors cut of blood simple and any new film with john turturro is a reason to still have faith in the power of acting but this time around i am not entirely convinced that the coens hit the jackpot paying tribute to homer and sturges sounds pretentious and impressive but it doesnt quite work the story evolves at a very slow pace the trademark wackiness seems a tad contrived and getting george cloony to star feels like a sell out also the way the coens dealt with depressionera politics and social issues is lightweight and unsatisfying having said that this film is light years more entertaining and amusing than any hollywood drivel that gets spewed at us regularly the fluency of their humour is something that your de nirocrystalde vito comedies will never achieve,black_comedy
i wouldnt have thought it possible but these performances manage to be both delightfully subtle and wildly over the top  i really enjoyed this film  this is one of those movies that will leave everyone with a favorite line mine is well isnt this place a geographical oddity  two weeks from everywhereoh and delmar steals this movie,black_comedy
i thought this film was brilliant you can always trust the coens to make great films and they dont let you down with this one a nice little adventure with great acting from all involved also has a good soundtrack with many catchy little tunes on it one of the greatest films of the year,black_comedy
what a terrific little film  the performances of the three escaped convicts clooney tim blake nelson john turturro are all deserving of recognition i was particularly fond of nelsons numbskull delmar  the script was based on the odyssey by homer and there are multiple direct references to the epic  set in the great depression however the coens creatively weave halftruth histories into the story  partially reallife politicians crooks klansmen and musicians meet up with the trio as they make their way to a hidden fortuneanother remarkable achievement of this film is the incorporation of some great period music  the soundtrack is one of the best to come out in recent memory  under the direction of the legendary tbone burnett o brother resurrects the bluegrass sounds reminiscent of bill monroe lester flats and earl scruggs  ingeniously the coens fashioned the script to present the music as a major star of the film and not just background garnish  its not far off to refer to this picture as a musicalor at least a parody of a musicalim generally a big fan of coen films  i remember thinking that barton fink was the most underrated film of its day  i think that o brother which was really snubbed by oscar might be picking up the baton  run dont walk to the theater to see this film  in my estimation its better than each of the 5 nominees for best picture this year95 out of 10 stars,black_comedy
reactions to this movie can typically be cut into two groups those who love it and those who just dont understand whats going on while such a requirement may keep a film from being accessible to appreciate this movie you have to know where its coming from forget homer what you really need is an understanding of american folk and bluegrass music this movie is a screwball comedy set in the land where all those bizarre old ballads came from what greil marcus calls that old weird america other movies that have been set there include night of the hunter and housekeeping this movie uses folk more effectively than any movie since bound for glory and maybe more improves on even that if you saw the movie and didnt understand it but would like to understand why so many people are calling it a masterpiece you should start by reading mystery train and invisible republic by greil marcus then listen to some of harry smiths anthology of american folk music or at least some stanley brothers get a basic understanding of that and youll see why this movie is so brilliant,black_comedy
roger ebert may have found that the coen bros were mixing there periods but this in no way get in the way of the fun  color humorous and even musical this movie is suitable for most family members  i was ready to see it again before i left the theater,black_comedy
i didnt expect it to happen when i went to see this movie but the coen brothers have really outdone themselves my favourite coens feature until now was raizing arizona but i think this one has replaced it you always waited anxiously to see what would happen next and usually it took you by surprise a fact that is sadly not common when you go to the movies nowadays george clooney was excellent as john turturro and tim blake nelson this was a coens masterpiece and they are truly legendary filmmakers and that song really catches on,black_comedy
i had a feeling this was going to be a great movie and it really is the singing and music is fantastic i went right out to buy the soundtrack good acting suspense story setting props and everything  just a great piece,black_comedy
this was an interesting concept a coen brothers version of the oddyssey it was enjoyable and funny all the way with clooney and goodman among others perfectly cast in their roles i loved this movie and recommend itif you remember the oddyssey at all from literature classics try to catch all the updates in the movie im sure youll catch them i did out of ,black_comedy
the movie kicks ass  eveything about it is amazing from the great soundtrack to the spectacular cinematography  the coen brothers have done it agian except this time it is going to be hard to top  i highly recommend seeing this great film i have seen is 6 times in the theater and am not done yet  this is defintly going to be a classic if it is not already,black_comedy
all a matter of opinion of course but i hated this movie  maybe i enjoyed fargo andespecially the big lebowski too much but i found the humour childish the acting average  apart from george clooney who was obviously having a lot of fun  and the music ghastly trouble was i saw o brother in edinburgh about an hour after watching  things you can tell just by looking at her  which is one of the best movies ive seen in years so maybe this unfairly coloured my view  i cant stomach the idea of sitting through the tedious odyssey again so ill never know,black_comedy
its derivative but its also unique  and its really very funny  if frank capra had had some spiked punch on one of his sets hed have come up with this movie  as it is we had to wait for joel and ethan to deliver it to us  worth the wait  i hung on every word could not figure out how it was going to all work out was very happy with the end  but i didnt really want it to end  i wanted more  more bluegrass more tight spots  more aerated livestock  more lovedup horny toads  and some more george nelson who else but the coens would put together this amazing cast and then give them material like this  i raise a can of dapper dan to them,black_comedy
i am a huge fan of the coen brothers work and was therefore quite anxious to view their latest project  i was first hooked with their 1987 cultclassic raising arizona and this was right up there with it  i will admit that with the coens you either love them or you dont and if you didnt enjoy their past projects then you will probably not be amused by this one  i must say that this film was done a great unjustice by the academy awards this year  nonetheless i found it hysterical and this is one i will definately pounce on when it hits dvddoctor ross no more george clooney has found his niche  he has an incredible nack for humor and comedic timing and he kept me laughing at every turn  his very clark gableish character was impecable  perhaps the best performance in the movie was that of tim blake nelson as delmar  he was a scream  his facial expressions alone were enough to put me in stitches and when he opened his mouth he only got funnier  clooney nelson and john turturro made and excellent onscreen teamother notable actors in supporting roles include john goodman as the archetypical cyclops character big dan teague charles durning as pappy odaniel holly hunter who is always superbplays penny wharvey mcgill clooneys wife and ray mckinnon as vernon t waldrip  this is one gem of film probably the best ive seen in a couple years so be sure to see it if you get a chance,black_comedy
then came the coen brothers  the trailerhobotrailer had whetted my appetite even before i had spotted the ethan and joel rubber stamp of excellence  but then came the film itself  o brother is such a wonderful film  beautifully beautifully shot  fabulous acting from george clooney  yes that george clooney and john turturro and john goodman  and michael badaluuco  and tim blake nelson a fabulous script  magnificent references to homer to johnson to southern politics and this praise from someone who thinks that the south starts at stoke  were i not laughing so much throughout o brother my jaw would have dropped to the level of delmars at the sheer perfection of this filmron viewed 21sep00ps more clues to those of you trying to piece together my biography through these reviews  my ex fatherinlaw claimed to be related to baby face nelson through shetland origins  beat that,black_comedy
i saw this film again today with a different friend just to make sure i wasnt over doing the praise spilling out of me everytime i talked about it i wasnt its the best coen film yet in a long line of best coen films yet ill try not to ramble on about everything youve already read about the amazing camera of roger deakins the phenomenal music sets upthen delivers atleast 5 perfect set pieces the terrific acting by john turturro john goodman holly hunter tim blake nelson charles durning and yes even mr hollywood blockbuster george clooney all their praises are written about much more eloquently in these pages than i could but i have to mention stephen root as the blind radio station owner who is outrageously funny in about seven minutes of screen timeif only they gave oscars for a cameo                       the only 10 of 2000 give it a shot,black_comedy
this movie is based on the classic story of homers odyssey set in the 30s in mississippi  3 convicts escape on a quest and the adventure takes them throughout rural mississippi in classic scenery and memorable characters  i am not familiar with the odyssey story at all but i really enjoyed this nostalgic rompclooney is great in this role as ulysses everett mcgill a wise cracking brylcreme addicted personality who goes on about the state of his affairs with a huge smile and a rambling southern accent  it was a real treat to watch him in this role  the cinematography is also quite good and it had that great 30s nostalgic feel and captured the era perfectly  i am a big sucker for nostalgia in movies and this film handled it perfectly  and turturro is great as always hes definitely another favourite actor of minei suppose being familiar with the original story i would have gotten more out of it but still it was a fun ride  it is not perfection but it is a refreshing change from the same old same old by placing a spin on a classic story in an interesting settingrating 7 out of 10,black_comedy
yes you read that right  this film is not for everyone because this is a film for those who can appreciate high brow humor  im not calling anyone unintelligent for not liking this film far from it  im just of the opinion that if you like comedy like this is spinal tap then this is your film  if you want something about mary look elsewhere  youll either love it or hate itpersonally i loved itone final word concerning the kkk scene  despite what you may hear or read the kkk is definitely not glorified in this film in fact just the opposite i was surprised to hear an african american was offended by that particular sceneso dont worry about that  go in with an open mind and you just may come away with a new movie on your top ten list  i did,black_comedy
if you are a fan of offthewall movies and are tired of the same old cookiecutter comedies that make their way out of the movie studios go and see o brother where art thou the movie is based enough on homers odyssey to make you grin his name is ulysses for example and hes questing for ithaca and there are lotuseaters and sirens and a cyclops but not enough to take away from the movie itself the coen brothers also did a great job of portraying the 1930s south correctly but without being judgemental about the times or trying to make a statement the best part to me was the soundtrack  a great collection of old timey music that youll be humming for days a great experience overall  check it out,black_comedy
coen brothers movies are generally hit and miss for me  as is george clooney  i almost gave up on this movie but i like it more and more each day  the soundtrack deserves credit for keeping this movie alive for me i cant get it out of my head  with the music i can also visualize the scenes corresponding to each song  there are some incredible individual scenes in the movie  the subtle humor gets funnier and funnier the more i think about it  see the movie but dont judge it right away  give it a couple of days and see if you cant vividly remember almost every scene of the movie  or are at least itching to buy the soundtrack,black_comedy
although not the coens best writing aka the big lebowski oh brother is a very funny and well produced film the film will be the cbs biggest box office success because it does not contain the violence and language of most cb films and will thus appeal to a wider audience despite the lack of violence and language the film is still coenesque in that it is well cast beautiful to watch and outrageously funny unlike their other films this film will make the cbs millions of dollars and new fans 1010,black_comedy
i try not to go into a film with high expectations how easy it is to be disappointed but for this one i couldnt help myself ive never seen a film by the coen brothers i didnt like a few of their films rank among my alltime favs so my expectations were skyhigh and even so i came out thrilled surprised and more than satisfied this story is a wonderful homage to the homeric epic but crafted so nicely that even one who has no knowledge of the odyssey will still love the film one or two scenes might be slightly confusingthe baptism scene and the sirens for example but not enough to ruin the film for anyone the cinematography was wow good gorgeous scenes gorgeous sets just plain gorgeous and the film was marvelously acted clooney was a standout his best performance ever even topping the peacemaker and he was brilliant in that and coen regulars john turturro and john goodman were fabulous as always allusions were everywhere not just to homer but to robert johnson and babyface the bank robber not the producer among others the script was masterful a perfect combination of epic flavour and modern story this film is a keeper hilarious wellwritten wellcrafted beautifully shotit proves that you dont need a 100 million dollar budget for special effects to make a quality film this is right alongside traffic and crouching tiger as the best films of the year the only reason i dont give it a perfect ten is that it runs just a little long an easy 910,black_comedy
ill be honest with you i wasnt real sure about this movie  it was in theaters in our area for a while before i convinced myself to go see it  i was pleasantly surprised  this was a crack up a minute  george clooney tim blake nelson and john turturro couldnt have played their parts any betterthe other thing that really made an impression on me was the music  now im not your biggest country music fan but i caught myself really getting into the music  i wouldnt even mind having the soundtrack  the music was funny and kind of catchyi had one problem with the movie  the language could have been cleaned up without the language i would have taken kids to see this movie,black_comedy
i had no idea what i was about to experience  and experience is what you go through with this movie  i felt i was in a contest to see who could laugh louder and harder it was a fully packed house and not one somber soul  i understand there are people who do not get real world humor and for those of them who just stumble into this oneoh welli can see this film surpassing raising arizona as a college cult film hats off to the coen brothers for making me want to go out and get some dapper dan,black_comedy
very delightful fun to watch and great to tap your toes to  i found the movie very satisfying with regard to acting with believable and unforgettable characters delivering great dialogue a coen brothers hallmark  the photography is superb with a sepia tint adding to the ambiance of the past  the music and i am not what you consider a country music fan is wonderful and beautifully blended with the action  the plot is as deep as you wish to delve into it with true references to homer  i was immediately struck with similar references to the wizard of oz as was a previous reviewer here  the kkk rally truly is done in the style of the segment called the march of the winkies from the wizard  also there are strong parallels between the governor pappy odaniel and the wizard himselfi am an inveterate coen brothers fan no doubt about it  this just the latest of their superior movies  common to all later coen brothers movies are quirky and memorable characters great dialogue and bizarre plots  the coen brothers make movies with a dickensian flairhighly recommended 1010,black_comedy
the coens have outdone themselves now that this film has surpassed all their previous works at the box office its time for a wide release in most cities you have to drive to see this one but its worth it clooney is wonderful turturro is his usual unusual self and tim blake nelson should have been nominated for an oscar as the lovable delmar the music will haunt you until you buy the soundtrack i am now an alison krauss fan after finding her on this soundtrack its too funny to miss it dont wait for the video go see it now because the cinematography which was nominated for an oscar is incredible,black_comedy
luscious and gorgeous for eyes and mind ive seen it twice and bought the soundtrack that i play all day and im going againthe coens have this peculiar ability to make the humans enter into a dimension where they are partly cartoon figures apparently without the use of prosthetics something which they have done before in the hudsucker proxy this may be a barrier to identification with the characters and keeps the movie from having resonant depth but sliding along through the visuals and story is a delight in particular the to me quirky and eccentric music making one of the most unusual soundtracks for a contemporary movie is a delight particularly those three little girls singing of working for the lord slightly off keygeorge clooney here clearly demonstrates that he can play someone other than george clooney with a vengeance the entire musculature of his face seems to have been morphed as an unique film it wont make everyone happy but it is worth seeing a film without any green made in the greenest state of the usa though oddly the green is still in the poster enjoy after allulysses is the bedrock of our culture,black_comedy
they just dont write em like this often enough fantastic dialogue and reat storyline adaptation not to mention cinematography and soundtrackthe three leads couldnt be cast any better anyone who has seen any work of turturro or clooney will honestly be floored by their original performances and the newcomer to the trio is perfectif youre not having a classic movie feeling by the time theyve finished eating dinner at turturros kins house go sneak out and watch another movie at the megaplex you aint gonna get it,black_comedy
mani loved this movie but heck im a country music fanatic and part redneck myself though but i dont think it will matter everyone will get a kick out of this movie  if you dont tap your toes in this flickyou dont have a pulse clooney did a good job wife enjoyed flick as well bought soundtrack soon after watching movienever done that beforelol,black_comedy
is it impossible for these guys to create a turkeyfrom their very first blood simple to this masterpiece they never cease to amaze meo brother is an excellent movie filled with the off kilter charactors and personality studies that are common with the coen boysi see the previous post gave great detail of the accounts of this movie so ill not burden you with redundant praise but i would like to mention that as well as another great performance from john goodman was a tremendous performance by mr clooneyi personally have never cared for george as an actoreither in his two tv regular stints roseanne and er or in his cinema flops ie perfect storm batmanetc but this time either he really is good and never had an appropriate vehicle to demonstrate this or he finally met people who are sculptures of the trade and molded a good performance out of himeither way it was great i strongly recommend this filmps it also has a wonderful soundtrack,black_comedy
warning  contains huge spoilers  if you have not seen the film do not readthe movie starts out with ulysses e mcgill george clooney pete john turturro and delmar tim blake nelson escaping from a prison farm when they fail to hop a freight train they come across a blind man on the railroad tracks who talks of a treasure that will disappear shortly while trying to find the treasure the three have runins with the authorities and also run into many people but just manage to get away by the skin of their teeth  pete and delmars sins are washed away during their romp at a lakealong one road they come across a young black man named tommy johnson chris thomas king who sold his soul to the devil in exchange for guitar playing skills  now the group comes across a radio station out in the middle of nowhere where they sing a song called man of constant sorrow as the soggy bottom boys  it becomes a hit in almost no time  they lose tommy shortly thereafter while trying to escape  then the men come across sirens who seduce them and lull them to sleep  ulysses and delmar wake up to find a frog in petes clothing  delmar insists that the frog be kept for fear it might be pete transformedin a restaurant they meet big dan teague john goodman who claims to be a bible salesman but is truly a conartist  he attacks them and robs them of their money  pete is also killed  then it is discovered that pete has been caught by the police and is almost flogged into making a confessionthe rest will remain a mystery unless youve read homers odyssey then you probably know what happens  overall this film is cute and is almost a musical due to the large number of songs  see this film with some of your friends and also any teenagers you may know,black_comedy
i think this is the coen brothers best movie to date  like the others its somewhat rambling and episodic leaving the viewer intentionally a bit confused as to whats going on but that style serves them wellthe cinematography is exceptional using the camera to great effect without having it become intrusivei never really liked george clooney in er  his performances always seemed a bit wooden and selfserving there  but in his role as ulysses everett mcgill hes exceptional projecting precisely the personality of a likeable guy who is part schemer and part deer caught in the headlights  turturro and nelson as his two nottoobright sidekicks are perfect in their roles as wellthe music is exceptional  its hard to believe that todays audiences would go for 30s country music but it works and its good,black_comedy
cute pretty cute  i like them character actors i doi like this over the top stuffgeorge clooney really held this picture together  at times in the middle of this picture it started to slow down and all of the characters started to run together what makes a character actor interesting is when heshe is playing opposite some straight characters as well  there were so many character actor roles in this that at times it got a bit tiring to watch kinda like the grinch whole stole christmas but nowhere as badthe movie picks itself back up from clooneys bootstraps and he and holly hunter who had a way too small role in this show us how these types of roles are done  not overdone  just done710,black_comedy
great aural and visual style wonderful comedic performances by mr clooney and tim blake nelson in particular and that unique coen brother style add up to a most satisfying experience in the cinemasome critics have found the treatment of the south offensive and it must be said that bible salesmen have rarely been less sympathetically portrayed but as long as you dont check your sense of humor at the door im mystified by how anyone could fail to appreciate and enjoy this filmthe music was tremendous and and i was grateful to be exposed to it the soggy bottom boys put the backstreet boys to shame should get best supporting performance by a toad as well 8  highly recommended,black_comedy
part fantasy part very calculated sideswipe at the politics of the southern united states the film takes us on an odysseyjust like homers original the end isnt nearly as important as the journey itselfall of the performances are good particularly george clooney  who should have been born earlier  clarke gable wouldnt have stood a chance,black_comedy
and there i was thinking that i could get the first review in i was at the same nft preview and i was damned impressed by this film the coen brothers have used many actors from their usual team johns goodmantuturro etc and have mixed them up with a varied bag of others to produce a very fine character driven cast the action rarely dwindles and there are some fine set pieces to remember many of which are punctuated by the type of visual gags that are seldom witnessed outside of a zuckerabrahams film the storyline is apparently based on homers odyssey but as both brothers have admitted to never having read it the plot is not constrained to any level of accuracy and their splendid imaginations are able to run rampant this film is a visual and comic treat more focused that the big liebowski funnier than fargo and as those are the only other coen brothers films i can remember now i will end my comparisons there go see it,black_comedy
most film makers use the same techniques the same structures the same cookie cutter to tell a story the coen brothers have a unique voice which is no better heard than in o brother its light but its worth seeing more than once it deals with big issues but its full of big laughs and clooney is a revelation postmodernists will tell me that im missing a deep irony when i say just how enjoyable this movie is at human level but take it at face value if you need a lift in your day and warmth in your heart and two hours of literary allusions thrown in for good measure go see this film,black_comedy
im so glad i finally got a chance to see this film before it got away it was a movie that was lots of fun and greatly entertaining  not a movie to take seriously but you can still see the parallels between it and homers odyssey its a pretty broad parody on southern life and the 1930s  the actors even act like they are 1930 type parodies  clooney was just great  totally unlike ive seen him beforethere were a few plot holes but not anything that you would count against this film the movie really drew me in and i kept wondering what was happening nextall in all a lot of fun  i hope they make more movies like this one,black_comedy
this movie was very funny and enjoyable from the beginning the sidekick characters were lovably unintelligent while george clooneys character spoke with an ironic eloquence a charming trait for a backwoods hillbilly the adventure pulls you along through the whole movie without letting up and the music will make you want to buy the soundtrack there is a charisma to clooneys character that can only be compared to russell crowes maximus in gladiator i gave it a 10,black_comedy
there are very few films that are highly rated by critics that i personally find atrocious  im sorry to say this was one of them  i had high hopes going into the film even though ive never loved any of the coen brothers films  george clooney is quite funny and charismatic in reality but o brother he was so annoyingly unfunny it frustrated me so much i feel the need to write something about this filmi think i could spot where the laughs were meant to be but they just werent funny  im a fan of turturros but his role was limited uninteresting and unfunny  i realise it had references to things i dont know about but i dont think thats a big enough reason for why i disliked it so much  there were too many eccentric characters  not everyone in a film can be eccentrici guess life doesnt make sense so why should i wrack my brains attempting to understand how george clooney won a golden globe for best actor in a comedysometimes i feel that perhaps i just missed the point to a certain film and doubt creeps in about my ability to concentrate throughout a film but im pretty sure that didnt happen in this case and im not about to waste another 2 hours of my life checking on that  ill stand by my original thoughtsand by the way some of the other films that were highly rated which i hated were out of sight starring clooney and the thin red line which had clooney in it for a couple of minutes  the funny thing is i have nothing against him personallymy rating is 0510,black_comedy
by far the warmest and most appealing of the coen brothers films a quintessentially american film a series of lovely vignettes are full of comic moments yet go deeper to capture the making of modern america the film is beautifully photographed and lit the hardedge ambience of the era permeates a landscape in which innocence and cynicism fight for primacy resulting in a draw the music is gorgeous the references to the odyssey arch and humorous penelope with a brood of daughters pursued by an oily pol who would replace her own flawed ulysses is an indelible image and george clooneys brave selfmocking performance is matched at every turn by an exemplary cast this is john turturros best everyman performance since quiz show and there is an air of unsentimental nostalgia about the whole enterprise that is peculiarly sweet and affecting,black_comedy
i had high expectations of this film going into it and once again the coen brothers have not disappointed the type of movie that may not click with most people on the first try but definately deserves a second or even third chance to fully understand and accept the characters one of the biggest complaints that ive read about this movie is that it doesnt really go anywhere  thats exactly the reason why i liked it so much  the film doesnt concern itself with spectacular special effects with the exception of the cow scene intriguing plot twists or a grand finale  instead what the coen boys are best known for is their characters george clooney is excellent as a fasttalking wannabe knowitall while tim blakenelson and john turturro are equally as good as his dimwitted sidekicks  clooney is quickly moving up the list of my favorite actors i really respected the way he was able to poke fun at himself and his leading man persona by creating a character who is so worried about his appearance that he wears hair nets while he sleeps  i left the theater both times thoroughly satisfied perhaps because i realized before hand what i was getting myself into  the lush scenery of the depressionera south and a soundtrack better than any ive heard all year only add to the rich tapestry that make up this film i guess then that the most important thing to remember if you do go see that its the journey that counts not necessarily the destination,black_comedy
possibly the coen bros most inventive movie to date it is crammed with memorable images a storyline nicked with some flair from the classics and acting and singing to give most moviegoers a hefty wallop of feelgood together with a sense of cutabovetherest aesthetic appreciation george clooney is at his best and combines comedy drama romance and singing in his performance ive met one or two people who didnt think much of it but many people would put it in the category of if you only go to see one movie this summer   ,black_comedy
a couple of years ago i heard a disc jockey on a bluegrass program in richmond virginia tell his listeners they have never been loved until they had made love to a fat man that statement much like the humor in obrother where art thou started to sink in after i had turned off the radio or in the case of this movie left the movie theatre the real disc jockey had an accent so slow time crawled along like it was wearing a porkpie hat and driving in the left lane and so southern he repeated his phrase three times picking up speed and bugging his eyes as he warmed up to his subject this is exactly what the record producer character did when he realized he had a hit record on his hands clooney and the others were excellent but the record producer was priceless,black_comedy
there are already 180 reviews of this movie so i wont waste your time with a lengthy treatise on the coen brothers latest offering  i will say this however  i am a huge fan of all of their movies except for raising arizona and i did walk out of the theater wondering if i had missed something in o brother where art thou  fortunately barton fink and the big lebowski had the same effect on me so i thought the movie over for about a week and then i saw it again  the fact is this movie is such a flood of sights and sounds and has so much to think about and at which to laugh there is simply no way to grasp it in one viewing  see it once give yourself a few days to let it sink in then see it a second time  this movie is flat out brilliant it just takes two viewings to realize it9510,black_comedy
producerswritersdirectors joel and ethan coen evoke the essence of such classic films as sullivans travels and i am a fugitive from a chain gang with their depression era comedy o brother where art thou directed by joel coen and starring george clooney  borrowing the title of the meaningful film that successful comedy filmmaker sullivan wanted to make in the 1941 preston sturges film sullivans travels and finally in reality making it is only the beginning of this clever funny tale based on homers the odyssey  the hero here is one ulysses everett mcgill clooney who along with two others pete john turturro and delmar tim blake nelson escapes from a chain gang commencing an odyssey for the trio wherein they ultimately traverse many of the railroads back roads and tankwater towns scattered throughout the good state of mississippi  it becomes an adventure of the first magnitude as the three cohorts encounter situations and characters that are humorous and sometimes poignant and for the audience always fun  its a richly woven tapestry of americana including plenty of traditional music that is bound to leave an indelible impression in the mind of the viewer ,black_comedy
okay so maybe george clooney has grown up in hollywoodhow nice to see a cast of good actors in a movie that deserves their talentsgeorge clooney of course just seems to get better and better he has redeemed himself in this movie for all his sins involving the desert and any kind of uniformhe couldnt have done it on his own who could and it seems the movie gods were smiling on us all when this film was in productionthis is a polished movie that exceeds mere funny by several orders of magnitude ascending to knew depths of depravity and new heights of humor often in the same sceneif you havent seen it im not going to spoil it for you by telling you the plot if you have seen it and didnt get it well  its your loss,black_comedy
what an unbelievably hilarious movie  every time george clooney opened his mouth and spoke with that unmistakable accent and diction i cracked up what a treat to see the respect the coens had for homers classic storythis was one of the best times i have had in a comedy since raising arizona  since the coens seem to recycle actorsactresses in their movies john goodman holly hunter i hope that george clooney will be in future movies by these great comic directors,black_comedy
all my friends have been gaga over george clooney for years i must admit i never saw an episode of  er with him in it but i dismissed him  as a tv star  well i was stunned when i saw three kings and i became a believer with oh brother where art thou he is the closest thing weve had to clark gable since well clark  gable not to mention the soundtrack is amazing it is all i iisten to these days  as a child my father sang to me hes in the jailhouse now  i stupidly thought he made that song up  so when that song started i was taken aback finally  the cohen brothers like all their other films  they stay with you  i wake up thinking about the charactars i worry about them i wonder what everett and the gang are doing next  i  know that s silly  but their characters become part of your life  what could be a better  testimonial,black_comedy
disclaimer i dont know who the coen brothers are i understand that george clooney used to be in some doctor show on tvthat being said i walked out of this movie thinking wellit was mostly funny then as days passed i said to myself wait i got that part then something else hit me i bought the sound track  oh my gawd then i said i must have missed something  i read the oddesy  the version i have is a lousy 159 pages long i think you can handle thatthe sound track drilled into me it is excellent i am dangerously close to reading the bible deep breath okok this is a first rate excellent movie it just takes a little time to sink in,black_comedy
perhaps a little too much in fact  its fun its sweet its sometimes inspired the bleached golden landscapes owe a lot to a nostalgia that for a nonamerican audience is instantly recognizable and therefore i assume pays a debt to fiction than historical reality the music is great clocking both alan lomax recordings from the period  intelligent country greats like gillian welch alison krauss  emmylou harris in the sirens song and the performances are fine holly hunter is never less than a delight  but o brother where art thou displays very little of the sardonic humour of fargo or raising arizona or the technical perfection of the comedy in the big lebowski surely one of the absolute best comedies of the last decade  this film is a lift but its a purely temporary onego see though it might not be up to their previous standard but its still a coen brothers movie,black_comedy

i really really enjoyed this movie it had been a long time since id left a movie theater feeling really good as a result of what id just watched but such was the case with o brother where art thou i know a lot of critics didnt appreciate this film saying among other things that it was silly had a thin plot or didnt make sense it also seems that a lot of critics feel a film must have deep social relevance or a powerful message to be worthwhile i myself do not feel this way movies after all were created as entertainment  a diversion to make people forget about their own humdrum sometimes dreary lives above all else i think movies are meant to make people feel good and what struck me most about o brother where art thou was the sense of joy  yes joy  that permeated the entire film the music was transcendent and the performances floored me with every role george clooney rises in my estimation everett was a glorious creature and this was thanks largely to his portrayer john turturro as far as i can recall has never given a single bad performance i count him among the most wonderful actors of his generation and tim blake nelson  always more active behind the camera than in front of it  was a pure delight often stealing the show from the two cinematic giants he shared the spotlight withbut i keep returning to the joy perhaps there wasnt all that much to this movie but i was transfixed nonetheless i was behind everett pete and delmar the whole way just because they were so much fun to root for i applaud joel and ethan coen for making movies simply for the love of movies i think this film as much as any of their others shows that to be the case  in other words for the joy of it this was unquestionably the best film i have seen in a long time and its simplicity lack of pretense and happygolucky tone all played large parts in that these days especially pure whimsy should be cherished in the movies  after all theres so little of it left,black_comedy
great moviegreat actinggreat music  what more can i sayi ran right out and bought the cliff notes to odyssey  and the movie soundtracki have not enjoyed a film as much as this in a long timei do have one complaint though  too much cursing,black_comedy
a totally silly enjoyable fun time at the movie theater  for me this is no longer a common experience  i love the brothers coen  tim blake nelson is so cute he almost steals the movie from clooney who is also terrifici wanted to take him home  the music is fantastic and carter burwell is now one of the best in his fieldjust sit back laugh and enjoy this movie is bona fide and wont make you feel in a spot,black_comedy
truly a coen brothers film as surreal and entertaining as all their earlier work be sure to see it on the wide screen as soon as possible it is visually stunning and fun to watch i still want to know where to find the soundtrack,black_comedy
the coen brothers have made a mark on the movies since their 1980s debut blood simple they reached a mass audience with fargo now they have given us another skewed vision with o brother where art thou the question is a skewed vision of what of homers odyssey of americas flyover country unless i have missed something in previous coen movies while these coscriptwriting brothers are obviously literate this is the first time they have based the plot of a movie on a classic story but it is not the first time they have told a story set in that vast part of the us which many moviemakers ignore on the other hand some residents of flyover country might prefer to be ignored the coens paint americas hinterland with broad and comical strokes i laughed at the antic characters in this movie but i winced too the coens make sport of hicks hayseeds rubes and hillbilliesthe only people it is still politically correct to make fun of perhaps this is allowed precisely because such folk are themselves famously politically incorrect or more to the point they too often look on political correctness as alien to common sense if one becomes genuinely sophisticated as opposed to being a poseur one realizes that the rubes are often right a sense of fair play makes me think that rural folk ought not to be picked on so much on the other hand i want to say yeah but this is really funny that of course would be regarded as a poor defense of any comedy made at the expense of some politically correct sacred cow that said so full of fun that i can hardly wait to see it again homers tale becomes a departure point whereby every cliche about 1930s rural america in general and mississippi in particular is rendered larger than life you have chain gangs ole timey country music the way it was before nashville discovered electric guitars folksy politicians new deal hydroelectric projects dirtpoor farmers covered with real dirt women with seven or more children bankrobbers who drive fast cars while wielding tommy guns and even the ku klux klan if you dont appreciate this movie you should check out some of the fare on american movie classics the coens are making loving fun of the style of 1930s movies complete with a performance from george clooney that often parodies 30s megastar clark gable,black_comedy
o the joy of going to a movie exiting and then immediately wanting to see it again ive read most of the comments posted here and can only wonder what would if anything bring joy to those who didnt like itthe idea of someone from canada or up north saying this was insulting to us southerners is highly amusing does anyone think there was a secret society of intelligentsia hiding in rural mississippi in the first half of the 20th centuryperhaps time and experience will be kind to the naysayers whose egos cloud their wisdom the coens will be admired for generations to come originality and the genius of artistic creation are rarely appreciated while the artist lives thank you joel and ethan,black_comedy
i just got back from the cinema and felt compelled to comment on this film it just totally blew me away for several reasons the 30s period detail wasnt period detailyou felt you were in a time warp and were back in the depression era george clooney especially in a couple of scenes eerily reminded you of clark gable the humor was unexpected and i havent laughed so hard in a theater in years and the photography was beyond gorgeousthe bleached out sunlit look of many of the settings was outstanding interesting film that gives you a lot to think about,black_comedy
this film is not of the same class as the big lebowski or fargo however the period recreations are excellent and the lead performances especially john turturros the link with homer is interesting but the film tends to drone on and i dont feel caught up in the usual coen brothers intriguean excellent musical soundtrack carries the film along but sometimes the displaced and surreal personal viewpoints that the coen brothers project in their films fails to captivate in this instance hilarious kkk choreography but the irony of everett being an astute social commentator as well as a convict has become an annoying cliche in coen movies where the most unlikely people talk in sociological language ie lazar in millers crossing i was slightly disappointed with this movie but with the coens another masterpiece may be around the corner the cinema would be a duller place without them,black_comedy
the cohen brothers have for a long time made films that were marketed towards such a small market and this film is yet another addition to a whole list of films that some people just wont get  the film which is lightly based on homers odyssey takes us through the escape of three convicts going to seek out a lost fortune they the three convicts meet various characters all of equal unimportance who simply move the film along while sticking to its root of the ancient text it is filled with a tremendous amount of humor that i thought was fantastic but i fear that a broad audience wont get the film is immersed in country music but fear not it is not the tim mcgraw or achy breaky heart country but some wonderful mix of sounds and voices that add a tremendous amount to the film and humor the sound track is worth the buy even for punk music fans like myselfthis film takes place in the deep south which is a perfect contrast to their previous films whereas fargo took us to snowy north dakota and the desert of the south west in raising arizona and the big lewbowski showed us the tacky side of la this film takes us to the low down dirty south of yesteryear a great film and worth every minute enjoy,black_comedy
i was so disappointed with roger ebert and his little ebert toady roeper and their review of this movie that i had to respond  this movie was given two thumbs down on their television program there hasnt been such a mistake made by prominent critics since william shakespeare was called an uneducated hack by london critics in the 1500sa film that stands so far above any competition in the comedy arena this year that im afraid a lot of critics cant see its brilliance  its a coen brothers movie so of course the writings slick the characters are interesting the actors are given the chance to be as creative as they can and the movie itself is just beautiful to watch what makes this movie stand out is the way that it combines so many different elements of creative history to form one boiled down piece of art  here is a just a little taste of what is going on in this movie  sullivans travels homers odyssey the wizard of oz bonnie and clyde cool hand luke robert penn warrens all the kings men james dickeys deliverance not to mention a real modernday commentary on spirituality  thats not all thats happening here either  i could write a book about it  there will be books written about ittheres a kkk scene in the film where the hooded imbeciles dance around in a semichoreographed ritual before attempting to lynch a black man  this scene bothers people because it makes fun of something we as a society deem so serious  i agree the kkk especially at its height of popularity was a serious problem  however in this film the kkk cant sing on key cant dance without stumbling over each other have a oneeyed member with only oneeye poked out of his hood have a dwarf in a kkk suit and dont have any control over the situation at hand get it not only are the kkk in this movie clearly villains they are also extreme idiotsokay i think thats enough even though i could go on and onthere are some truly mesmerizing scenes in this film  the writing here is as fancy as the visuals in crouching tiger hidden dragon  there arent many flying swordfights or digitally enhanced scenes in o brother but the words dance and zoom over the rooftops of the american south,black_comedy
greetings again from the darkness  another quirky experience from the coens who have provided some of my favorite moviegoing moments  blood simple and fargo are classics and the hudsucker proxy millers crossing and barton fink are right behind  i was never a fan of raising arizona but this similar film has some really great touches  no one casts more brilliantly than the coens  not a fan of george clooney but he is outstanding in his role  many coen regulars make their appearances holly hunter john goodman john turturro but i loved tim blake nelson as delmar my favorite bits include the spoofs on legendary guitarist robertcalled tommy in the film johnson selling his soul to the devil at the crossroads and infamous bank robber george nelsons wonderfully played by son of sam actor michael badalucco reaction to being called baby face as a film lover i trust the coens to push the envelope every time out  weak story in this one but truly enjoyable nonetheless  the funniest part is that after seeing this film people are buying the soundtrack  t bone burnett does a remarkable job of making one want to purchase a hillbilly cd,black_comedy
this is the best movie ive seen in a long time  if youre a coen brothers fan youll love it if youre not youll probably be mystified destined to be a classic right along with millers crossing and fargo,black_comedy
the coen brothers have outdone themselves again another great piece of work by far their best film since fargo george clooney gives a magnificent comedic performance that should receive oscar consideration i am never disappointed by a coen movie but this film was above the par that they have set for themselves best film of the year,black_comedy
so far this year the only thing better than this movie is this movies soundtrack i take that back the only thing better than the soundtrack would be 30 minutes alone with all 3 sirens i shall say no more,black_comedy
let me say from the beginning that i gotta be nuts to add to over 150 reviews but maybe some buff will read this and the others like i did  ive read homers odyssey seen preston sturgess sullivans travels and all of joel and ethans major films  i love this one  why  interestingly enough reading the comments by those who didnt like this film revealed more about the tastes of the reviewers than any real substance about the film  some didnt like abusing animals clooneys dialect or klansmen marching in a busby berkeley parody  all well and good  lets be perfectly politically correct and inoffensivesomething joel and ethan dont do so well  page turturro and clooney are great  so are durning and goodman  in fact everyone was great  there were no soft spots in the acting  i especially loved the  folks down at home  no cute little yuppie extras  those folks looked like depression era mississippians  but seriously folks  this is an excellent film with lots of fun moments and one which i will see again and again  and btw how could anyone not like the big lebowski no man its the dude,black_comedy
unlike some reviewers i think this may be my favourite of the coen brothers films  it gets everything right  its unassuming but by no means inconsequential another masterpiece of comic mythmaking that builds on the big lebowski and goes further and higher  its certainly not plotdriven  homers odyssey primarily provides a rationale for the hangingtogether of episodes on motifs as well as helping to create a fantastical atmosphere in which the everyday and the supernatural mingle the coens get away with scenes that would be disastrous in most films how they manage it i dont know but they can work the klan into a comedy without trivialising the organisation they contrive to be sentimental and disabused romantic and downtoearth at the same time  george clooney anchors the film with a fairly relaxed straight performance that builds on his out of sight persona and this enables many of the supporting performances to go for baroque  turturro proves his versatility yet again  in many ways though the musicians are the stars of the show im utterly ignorant of bluegrass but i think im going to have to buy the soundtrack album,black_comedy
i enjoyed this movie more than anything ive seen in quite some time this is easily the coen bros masterpiece i wont go into any details  you have to see this one yourself i would recommend boning up on your homer youll appreciate this adaptation of the odyssey so much better,black_comedy
all coen brothers movies are fantastic in the literal sense of the word yet they are done with great intelligence technical skill attention to detail and always strongly with an overt and subtle sense of humor a person can easily slip into the flow of the story this is what happens with o brother where art thouthe story takes place in rural mississippi during the depression years the costumes settings and props look so authentic and the actors are so engaging and play their roles so well and they are so well directed that there were times that i forgot that this was a modern film the coen brothers unusual and often disturbing sense of humor is in practically every scene of the film but when the humor is disturbing as it is in most of their films there is a reason for it it is a comment on human weakness and human triumph their films are the medieval morality plays of the late 20th  early 21st century and one of their best,black_comedy
the brothers have done it again how do they keep topping themselves and produce such a variety of filmsthis one is sure to win additional awards and have broader appeal than lebowski to coen brother fans awards are just icing on the cake the real signature of their work is the legion of loyal fans who will watch this one over and over againboys you are my sunshine,black_comedy
this movie has a splendid spiritual nature to it  they get down to the basics immediately during the opening credits and the film is good natured almost every step of the way  a river baptism a scratchy recording session and a kkk meeting are brilliantly staged using great production values grainy depression era cinematography and quirky direction by joel coen ethan coen produces the film wonderfully and both coens write the film with the highest character development  this is george clooneys first great film  its an oscar worthy performance in an oscar worthy film and is second only to fargo as the best coen brothers film  youll get hooked on the films soundtrack  ,black_comedy
an all around excellent film its refreshing to see a movie where every sentence does not have at least one f in it  tim blake nelson as delmar has got to be one of the best comedic performances i have seen in a long time i even enjoyed george clooney even though i am not a fan of his add to it having charles durning and its a must see for me,black_comedy
ive seen oh brother where art thou twice already and loved every minute of it  i took my mother to see it and she was truly amazed at how accurate the coen brothers were at portraying mississippi in the 30s she lived on the delta at that time and was truly shocked at the authenticity of the physical sets and the attitudes portrayed in this movie i noticed that the reviews from southerners  seem to be more favorable for this movie than those from people in the northern part of this country i guess its one of those things where you have to experience the flavor of the area to appreciate the portrayal of the area im definitely going to buy this and play it for a long time to come,black_comedy
theres something about the coen brothers  while fargo and the big lebowski were excellent they seem to have this obsession with symbolismin the big lebowski it was a rug in this film its the tin of hair gel bizarre  it got a bit off putting by the end actuallythis wasnt as good as some of their other writing accomplishments but is a well told little tale without ever jumping out at you as being an outstanding filmclooney is as good as ever and someone in the theatre was even stupid enough to think that the signing tracks were george himself duh,black_comedy
i loved this movie i thought it was one of y2ks best it works on many levels which i look forward to studying when it comes out on dvd ive read several reviews and no one mentions the movie jokes my favorite was the kkk scene compare it to the scene in the wizard of oz where scarecrow tin man and lion try to get into the castle of the wicked witch i couldnt stop laughing,black_comedy
i cant say enough about this beautiful movie the imagery the camera work the locations the story the acting and oh the music im not a big bluegrass fan but i went out and bought the soundtrack cd  something i rarely dothis is the kind of movie you want to go out and tell people about why is this playing in so few theaters its been several days and some of the scenes keep playing in my head i really cannot wait to see it again and will be buying the dvd this is what movie making is all aboutfor those wanting to take kids my advice is to go for it the worst language in the movie that i remember is sum bitch  and if your kids havent heard that well you must be a puritan our girls ages 13 and 11 loved this movie we all left the theater smiling go see it,black_comedy
i liked this movie best of all the coen brothers movies and i think more than anything it was the soundtrack which seemed to carry the characters as well as us through the story  plus it takes place in that coen brothers world that seems like reality except nobody in it is like anybody you ever met  delmar is the key,black_comedy
oh brother is not a bad flick but the coen bros have to go a long way to top fargo see it for the sound track and the jokes though the audience i saw it with did not seem to even giggle at a single joke like the oneeyed mask of john goodman or the funny faces made by the two fellow travelers at the siren scene this is a fun romp with some good stuff it just doesnt achieve greatness though it does comes close,black_comedy
i cannot remember a movie that has captured my heart  soul as much as this  has oh wait the wizard of oz did the rarest of movies that perfect zen of everything in the production working as a fine oiled machine or should i say a fine dapper dan oiled machine a masterpiece for the ages,black_comedy
this was one good film  i had expected something decent but i hadnt expected to walk out thinking i cant wait to be able to buy that film it has an excellent storyline all acting is top notch and it is very funny the only complaint i would have is to say that i had some trouble understanding the southernamerican accents which the characters had im just dumb but this did not spoil the film  the film also gives you a good sense of fulfilment and leaves you satisfied when leaving the cinema  go and see it,black_comedy
george clooney has come a long way from his beginning days doing films such as one fine day out of sight was clooneys first commendable film and since then it has been all up hill for the once er doctor clooneys character is smart witty and hilarious blending a perfect mix of adventure and comedy turturro and nelson give great performances and though the movie may drag at points the hilarious finale will make it worth your while 9 out of 10,black_comedy
if theres only one film you have to see this year this is it there are not enough words in the english language to describe how wonderful this film is  itll make you laugh but not cry out loud  youll be rolling in the aisles its no wonder that this film has been nominated for so many awards not to mention the recent golden globe victory  i smell an oscar,black_comedy
i laughed out loud and a lot i cant remember the last comedy that i enjoyed as much as this george clooney may have trouble topping this although i struggled with the accents a little my british origins the dialog as well as the characters the coen brothers createdadapted are brilliant we both went home arguing who would read homer first and we will probably both be disappointed my wife thinks i am mad wanting to buy the sound track but to be very honest i enjoyed the music as wellgreat movie dont miss it definitely on my dvd buy,black_comedy
while the coens appear to have reached the status of they who shall never be derided ever among critics there are still those of us who point knowingly to the confusion and misjudged intricacy of millers crossing and the often hellish excesses of barton fink and say boys youre admittedly great but youre not perfect were not going to wet our pants automatically as soon as you make a new movie youve still got to convince us so i come to the new coens movie with a more open mind than someafter the masterpiece doublewhammy of fargo and the big lebowski  the latter often seen as somehow coen brothers lite mainly because it is so very funny but repeated viewings attest that it is one of their best most tightlyplotted and wellacted films with inspired dialogue throughout  an oddity as well as an odyssey apologies for that lame joke there but it certainly rambles far more than any other coen while the downhome dialogue lacks the sparkle weve come to expect from themthe credits tell us that its based on homer well frankly they could have got away with pretending that it was original as the homeric references are few and far between john goodmans eyepatch signals that he is the cyclops the singing sirens everetts wife is called penny as a whole though the film does resemble the odyssey in that the main character is wandering seemingly aimlessly for a long time without really doing anything  things just happen to him this is not really a criticism trying to stick closely to homer would have no doubt been false and ridiculousthe performances of course are exemplary george clooney gives an oldfashioned riproaring turn as the dapper everett while relative newcomer tim blake nelson is funny and sweet the coen regulars turturro hunter goodman durning need only to turn up to be great the period look is fantastic roger deakins photography is beautiful and the film simply engages and entertains without trying to grip or thrill neither does it fall prey to the clevercleverness of so many movies made by intelligent literate filmmakers it also contains more than one classic moment of coen comic absurditymy guess is that like lebowski o brother will improve immeasurably with repeated viewings as the rich subtleties of plot and performance become clearer not a masterpiece then  for now at any rate  but an undoubted success,black_comedy
hilarious reworking of the odyssey and a great performance by george clooney as ulysses er everett mcgill only marginally smarter than his dim companions pete and delmar played by john turturro and tim blake nelson mcgill still manages to talk stumble and luck into everything his heart desires great score full of modern reworkings of american blues and bluegrass standards and beautifully photographed a real pleasure im looking forward to the coens version of the iliad,black_comedy
in a word wonderful the mix of humor music and casting makes this film worth every inflated penny the theatres are charging george clooney john turturro and tim blake nelson shine as the men of constant sorrow this film looks like a picture postcard the natural beauty of mississippi is a strong costar as well the coen brothers have outdone themselves truly funny and my latinteacher wife was delighted by the fact it was all based on the odyssey you will leave the theatre with man of constant sorrow going through your head if you dont already know them you will discover alison krauss and dan tyminski and buy their cds do yourself a favor and buy the soundtrack before you see the movie but by all means see the movie,black_comedy
this unique adaptation of homers odyssey is a triumph of modern cinemathe coen brothers have achieved that wonderful sense of surprise in retelling a classic tale these guys are great so many creative teams upon achieving a major success ie fargo continue to make the same film over and over not the coen brothers oh brother where art thou is clever original and totally charming loved the film and will recommend it to friends,black_comedy
i went to o brother not really expecting anything other than a new cohen brothers movie i have not read homers odysseyi am a big fan of the cohen brothers so i am probably biased to some degree but i found the movie very entertainingi am not a big fan of george cooney either but i found myself imitating him in conversation afterwards with large words and long sentencesmy favorite character had to be tim blake nelson as delmar john turturro was excellent as usual john goodman had a good supporting role and as usual all the extras and supporting casts were very impressivethis was a stunningly beautiful movie and definitely should be seen on the big screen i plan on buying this one also when it comes out on dvdi rated this a 8 out of 10 not quite as good as raising arizona or fargo but right on up there,black_comedy
i think that a lot of people would say that this movie doesnt really have much of a plot or any ascertainable message in its finale that we might all learn something frombut theres no denying that o brother is charged with effect  delightfully appealing  how many movies have you ever seen that would be as entertaining to your starchy old grandma as they were to your jaded goofy artist cousin  this is a film for everyone  its the best comedy of the year sorry adam sandlerno wait im not sorry and perhaps my favorite movie altogether for 2000  take off your dance shoes  go see it  this movie should be 1,black_comedy
as one who grew up in mississippi and spent a great deal of time in the mississippi delta im invariably disappointed and irritated by stock characterizations of southerners in movies  this one gets it so right its righter than realistic  in fact im probably related to delmar alternately hilarious and obtuse o brother where art thou takes us on the jailbreaking journey of three depression era convicts  all the locations are right and tim blake nelson is unbelievably spot on with his period delta dialect george clooney amazes me by making this acting choice and where he misses the mark dialectically he makes hay with his ulysses character  john turturro is fantastic too but the real star of this one is the writer and director ill see this one again many times,black_comedy
drama tragedy humor overthetop reenactments of the odysseythis movie had it all  plus the authentic southern gospelhillbilly music is extraordinary particularly john hartfords rendition of man of constant sorrowa wonderful version of a gospel classic  the casting cinematography writing and plot were nearly perfect do not miss this movie it may be the cohen brothers best,black_comedy
my wife talked me into seeing it  even though i had loved fargo for its originality the trailer for o brother looked too much like dukes of hazzard to me  and george clooney  give me a breakwell give it a look  tim blake nelson is a stitch in one of the three principal roles and george and john are superb as well  if they werent actually singing the synching was excellent and they pulled it off in grand style  it was one of very few films that caused my wife and me to agree that we could easily walk back into the theatre pay another fare and watch it again  that is the highest praise i can give to a filmif you think you should dislike hillbilly music youd better stay away but if you have an open mind and like to be entertained see it,black_comedy
there are two sides to film directors joel  ethan coen  there is the dark and suspenseful side which they showed in blood simple and fargo then there is the goofy and wacky side displayed in raising arizona and hudsucker proxy  with thier new film o brother where art thou the coen brothers use the wacky and silly road in telling a modern version of homers classic poem the odyssey  and the coens use their trademarks throughout this film from the comical and amazing stunts to john turturro ulysses everett mcgill george clooney is a prisoner in the state of mississippi during depression 1930s  ulysses is a man who takes good care of his hair with dapper dan hair grease and wearing hair nets while sleeping and has a rather unusual intellect for a prisoner in the 1930s ulysses decides to break free from work detail one day bringing along his two chainmates pete john turturro and delmar tim blake nelson  where ulysses is smart pete is arrogant and delmar is not too bright  ulysses convinces his mates to escape from prison to seek the pile of gold that ulysses hid before getting sent to jail they first run into a blind prophet on a handcart who predicts that the three men will be going on a great journey on their way back home while on their way back to ulysses homestead they have the same encounters that the character of ulysses encountered in the odyssey like odyssey ulysses pete and delmar encounter sirens a criminal being george babyface nelson a godess turning one of them into a frog zeus as governor pappy o daniel cyclops big dan teague suitors and even charybdis  all of these enconters led for ulysses to see his soon to be exwife penny holly hunter before she marries a crooked suitor and taking their seven daughters with her the very enjoyable thing about comparing this film to the odyssey  having been force read odyssey in high school i understood the inside jokes that joel and ethan coen put into this film for the modern telling of the thousands of years old poem if hollywood filmmakers like baz lurhman can do modern version of william shakespeares romeo  julliet then why cant the coens do odysseyi also did enjoy the acting in this film  george clooney proves that he is not only a cool actor but also funny and good  he makes ulysses a character what pete calls a big mouth smart aleck  ulysses is a man who doesnt believe in faith but believes in coindences and luck instead while pete and delmar who ulysses calls dumber than a bag of hammers do believe in faith and superstition which makes ulysses either egotistical or intelligent or perhaps both and tim blake nelson is also very enjoyable as the not too bright delmar who is usually in the middle of the arguments between ulysses and pete and who does believe in old fashion superstition  and the other actors from john turturro charles durning john goodman holly hunter and michael badalucco all deliver good performances as well but two things stand out with o brother first is the bluegrass music its outstanding  there are lots of classic songs that are depression era time that is played on the soundtrack of the film  but the modern written man of constant sorrow which is sung by ulysses pete and delmar as the soggy bottom boys is the best song that will have you humming as you leave the theater  and the directing by joel coen is also very well done with great pacing some very amusing scenes and wacky characters makes o brother a splendid comedy in the year in review 2000 issue of entertainment weekly film critic owen gilbertman said that o brother was the worst movie of 2000  the worst  more worse than other terrible movies with the likes of ready to rumble big mommas house supernova next best thing and the dreaded battlefield earth  i think mr gilbertman either had obnoxious people sitting next to him or had a bad hangover from a party the night before while watching o brother at the cannes film festival  how could this very enjoyable and wacky film be bad  yet he give a movie like charlies angels a b for being trashy yet fun  at least film critic roger ebert gave o brother another chance before giving a final review to saying that some scenes were good but not good enough to recommend  i think mr gilbertman should pick up a copy of the odyssey and realize the similarites between the film pieces of art but there are still plenty of big and small named critics who praise o brother and its even nominated for best picture comedymusical for golden globes  and after watching this movie i can see why  its the coens doing their dr jekyl filmmaking the lightweight fun and goofy side of a story  but some critics and coen fans prefer the mr hyde vision of the coens with dark and moody  but whether you enjoy wacky films or just the coens in general like me then o brother will please you a great deal with you humming the songs from the soundtrack on the way home   out of five,black_comedy
i love this movie my wife and i watched it twice already if you liked big lebowski you love this one the coen brothers just have this taste of comedy like you and me and they bring it across like no others the acting is just superb george clooney is great and john turturro is excellent as usual a great movie a must see,black_comedy
im sorry to sound like a spoilsport but if this film been made any less than the coen brothers i would have watched it mildly enjoyed it and held my peace however given the quality of the brothers previous efforts and given the overwhelmingly favorable reception this film has got so far i feel duty bound to express my disappointment at the brothers latest effortis the film really so funny  it is if you enjoy endless laboured repetition of gags that were not so clever in the first place for those who have not seen the movie yet please skip to the next paragraph although all im giving away is that i dont understand how repeating were in a tight spot three or four times or repeatedly saying i thought you were a toad qualifies as humour the first time round these evoked a slight titter the second third and fourth time around a definite yawn there are undoubtedly better moments such as that provided by john candy as psychopathic conman however i found that the film generally fell short of the ironic comic judgement that was there in the brothers earlier films such as barton fink and fargowas it visually interesting  certainly many shots have a richness of color which rivals the most overthetop southerncomfort advert and theres a fair share of shots that pan fade and zoom with agonizing slowness but this plush cinematic indulgence is surely the preserve of  lesser talents who need it to spice up their indifferent films give me the cool arctic flatlands of fargo any day or the bleak earthiness of blood simple im sorry but the perpetual golden summery haze of o brother totally failed to excitegood performances  underfortunately the three leads had nothing to get to grips with take the  george  clooney  character  about five  minutes  into  the film we  ascertain that hes selfimportant  pretentious and obsessed  with his hair  and thats  about the sum  of it  his  portrayal of the  character  stays at this level for the  duration of the film which   to me  seemed very long from a performance point of view the other two leads fare no better again john candys  contribution lightens the gloom somewhat but the  film is otherwise  burdened with a galaxy of mediocre character roles which are devoid of the originality that   we  have   come  to expect from the coen brothersi could go  on and on especially when it comes to the moral confusion that consistently blights the film  but  suffice it to say that this flabby film disappoints where other coen  brother films have delighted i know im in  a minority on this one but i  hope my review redresses the balance,black_comedy
the coen brothers will always continue to amaze me this movie was awesome the photography of the movie is stunning and the story pulls you into the journeytheir earlier most acclaimed film fargo was a meanspirited parody on dumb talking minnesotans instead this movie picked on the dumb talking people of mississippi obwat is a celebration of southern culture especially the folk music which for no aparent reason almost made the film itselfgeorge clooney did the best perfomance of his life as only the coens can bring out the coen regulars did an awesome job once againsee this movie even if you think the trailer looks stupid or if youve never seen a coen brothers movie before its never too late to start and be reborn if you willpetes movie rating out of 10 ninea,black_comedy
this film is a spectacle of sorts  ysee theres these three soggy sonsubitches by the names of everett clooney pete turturro and delmar tim blake nelson who escape from a chain gang and embark on a journey acrost the state of mississippi in the depression era 1930s  loosely following homers odyssey they jump from one frying pan into the next fire and over again  they get lost get saved a marvelous baptism scene and manage to squeeze themselves into the strangest musical renditions and dance sequences imaginable  clooney gives a classic performance as a character i can best describe as the humanized version of foghorn leghorn a knowitall who loves to hear himself speak  then theres pete played by john turturro whos a grumpy guy along for the ride  at the bottom of this food chain gang is delmar played by tim blake nelson  ole delmar is a simple fellow with a good heart whos trying to keep a clean spirit in leu of the events these characters become involved in  woven into this deep south motif are a black blues singer who sold his soul to the devil two shady candidates for the guvnas office and a one eyed bible salesman played by john goodman theres so many things to notice in this film  theres a looney tunes quality but also a very realistic quality portraying the depression era politics and poverty to a t  theres also a three stooges quality and the at the same time a very preston sturgess humanist thing  its the perfect balance for me but quite possibly the coolest thing about this film is the music topping off that old timey look the film has  its awesome bluegrass delta blues and gospel music and its a character of its own in the film  long live the coens and o brother i will be in line to see this again,black_comedy
the coen brothers have done it again this is an aone top drawer comedy george clooney is great and im not a big george clooney fan actually the whole cast is great tim blake nelson is funny and has many great lines charles durning holly hunter john turturro john goodman  i cant remember them all  even the extras are perfect for the movie  they look like they walked out of the 30s and onto the set too many funny lines and situations to remember  ill have go see it again and get the sound track in addition to the comedy the movie itself is just beautiful  check out the color of the the trees in the baptism scene i also loved the wezy radio stationthis movie lived up to my expectations actually it exceeded them way to go joel and ethan,black_comedy
the coen brothers have done again what they are best at this movie is flawless and well rendered the dialogue is witty and interesting and the music is first rate the problem which was first posed to me by an article in the san francisco chronicle i think is that the movie has little to say in a broader context there is no new philosophy to really be taken from this movie though it is a kickass ride i still think that its the best movie of 2000 but then thats not saying much,black_comedy
throughout their film career the coen brothers have never disappointed except at the box office whether this film will be a commercial success remains to be seen i saw it the first weekend of release in the uk with only a small handful of other people this is a moderately faithful retelling of homers odyssey set in a depression hit south complete with the coen brothers now obligatory fake plot the script is a masterpiece of dialogue realistically creating the 30s yet referencing modern day issues the acting is sublime george clooney is on top form john turturro is always good but theres also an excellent performance from relative newcomer tim blake nelson john goodman shows up in a brilliant cameo as a bible salesmanthiefkkk member also add into this an excellent supporting cast and holly hunter to boot o brother contains without doubt the funniest ku klux klan scene ive ever watched which should be required viewing for klan members and activists alike to make them all realise how daft they look a word too for the soundtrack a mishmash of 30s blues and country ill be queueing up for the cd the coen brothers really are master story tellers true artists in an industry full of artisans who cares if its a commercial success hollywood probably will so for the sake of there being many many more coen bros movies go and see it you will not regret it,black_comedy
this movie will be remembered as on of the great movies of the year this was a whimsical and at times surreal look at 3 convicts on the run during the 1920s the acting was superb this movie is a major oscar contender forbest costume and makeup   and   soundtrack,black_comedy
this movie had everything going for it stunning photography an incredible soundtrack 3 great lead performances all touched off by that undeniable coen brothers touch  but what went wrong with this pictureo brother is supposedly based on homers the odyssey and fargo was supposedly a true story  like that legendary tale 3 escaped convicts embark on their own crazy adventures in search of buried treasure along the way they run into a series of characters played by coenmovie veterens like holly hunter john goodman charles durning and moredespite all the goods the movie lacked a strong backbone to support what it had  the central plot is paperthin before trailing off into nonexistencedont get me wrong  i liked what i saw  i got some great laughs especially from george clooney who is such a standout in this movie  but i was very dissatisfied with how the movie unraveled  i am and will always be a fan of the coens work but this particualar movie is not my favorite,black_comedy
i saw this film today at an early matinee cost 900 and boy was it worth it  from everything like the snappy dialogue to the beautiful scenery this film is my favorite coen brothers yet just watch it and see,black_comedy
while not the best coen bros film by a long shot i must say this movie was one hell of a ride i was hoping for a tighter interpretation of the odyssey but it was good enough the soundtrack to this movie was amazing and thats really what drove this movie along the music george clooney was fabulous and his performance reminded me in a weird way of the way bruce campbell would have acted in this movie haha the music alone is worth the price of admission to this flick and its utterly utterly entertaining ,black_comedy
i loved this movie basically i got to see 2 for the price of one not only is it a hilarious zany comedy but also a long overdue heartwarming tribute to american roots music the soundtrack is incredible and i hope it goes platinum congratulations and thanks to tbone burnett being a great fan of the famous blues legend robert johnson i was tickled to see him get some screen time in this movie as tommy johnson sidekick to the soggy bottom boys who with the fake beards could quite easily pass for another fine blues band from the south  zz top  if you love authentic american roots music of any kind you will appreciate this movie as far as the acting goes it is all round superb george clooneys performance has converted me from a sceptic to a believerthough the odyssey is ostensibly the inspiration for the movie i think the coen brothers are trying to put us off the scent of what must be the real inspiration  jim jarmuschs classic 1986 down by law featuring tom waits roberto begnini before his life was beautiful and john lurie down by law is also about the rambling adventures of 3 misfit escaped convicts only they are on the loose in the bayous of louisiana not mississippi and even has the same roasted gopher scene in it rent at your local video store if you can find itquite simply the movie experience of the year for me,black_comedy
i have been shaking my head over the reviews this film is getting  even roger ebert and cnn not to mention many writers here apparently find it disjointed and plot less how bizarre i and my housemates walked out raving about the tightness of the plot no character is superfluous every thread begun is knotted in at the end  its as neat as fine beadwork i dont want to give away plot points but trust me its just delectable how elegantly characters weave in and out of the plot found and lost and saved just in time to do their part look just for one example at the scene where the soggy bottom boys perform at the political rally and at least five plot elements converge in about ten seconds of lovely reaction shots disjointed my boot how can people be missing thisand thats not even all the good stuff this is a beautiful movie handsomely shot in bleachedout tones that fill the screen with the heat and weariness of the depression south the muchpraised soundtrack deserves it the performances are rich with quirky humor and affection i can hardly remember feeling so good after a movie that the coens have chosen to use just about the entire catalog of popculture period southern references  openair baptism singing chain gangs the ku klux klan huey longstyle politicians bluesmen selling their souls at the crossroads  only adds to the abstracted and gentle comedy of the film even the firelit klan meeting combines menace with absurdity looking as if choreographed by the team of leni riefenstahl and busby berkeley honestly i just dont see all the ridicule and mockery of country southerners that others are seeing here its too goodnatured for that the thread of homers odyssey runs through it more smoothly than youd expect from the prophetic blind handcar man as teiresias the seer and maybe as charon the boatman of the styx as well to the alluring sirens at the river with a nod to circe the sorceress who turned men into animals when a frog is mistaken for a transformed man to big john goodman as a clubwielding eyepatched cyclops and of course to ulysses need to get home before his wife penny penelope remarries and there are scenes of wonderful beauty and magic realism like the singing whiteclad baptists drifting through the woods toward the river and the dreamy vision of the sirens at their washingthis is a fine fine movie the coens back at top form after the utterly disappointing and depressing big lebowski and the rest of 2001 is gonna have to do some work to come up with a better film,black_comedy
im sorry  but this movie was awful  reading these comments before i saw the movie i expected something so much better  turturro and nelson were pretty convincing as hayseeds  not so george clooney   those who complain hes always the same in every movie will definitely see a different performance   i dont know if it was the come and go accent or that big beautiful hollywood smile that made him seem totally miscast for this part the story meandered painfully without direction and seemed to go on and on and on i was glad to be put out of my misery when the credits finally rolled i give it 1 12 stars and im being generous,black_comedy
i have been a fan of the coen brothers for many years  what surprised me about this movie was how they successfully incorporated bluegrass music into the moviewhich i have previously not been explosed to i am now a fan of this type of music  i hate musicals but without being a musical itself it is very close to being one though and it added greatly to my enjoyment of the movie  the movie is very funny in a 1930s version of dumb and dumber kind of movie but with the high quality integration of very entertaining musical moments it becomes a great movieat least for me  the sirens were the high point for me the often repeated a man of constant values was well done and the song rock candy mountains was wonderful in its authentic soundone of my favorites of the last several years,black_comedy
the earliest memory i have is hearing my mother sing you are my sunshine my only sunshine     music like that is at the heart of this film  go listen to the samples at amazon  if you find this stuff hopelessly cornpone then save yourself the aggravation and see a braindead action thriller instead  but if you appreciate american music from the pretv era you really shouldnt miss o brotheroh yeah  while youre at amazon buy the sound track  it has everything from the movie and more,black_comedy
you can always rely on the coen brothers to try something original and fresh this is an excellent comedy with clooney especially showing hes come on so well can you believe he was batman even the music becomes quite catchy after an hour or so give it a go you wont regret it,black_comedy
this movie is awful and especially the musiceven in those days they didnt listen to crap like that this movie is so full of crap theres no plot there is no story there is no point i felt it was a big achievement watching the whole of it this movie is absolutely boring and does not deserve to be called a comedyit is not funny and whats the deal with all the freakin high grades the actors keep talking all kinds of bulls which makes no sense trying to make it look like somethingi am sorry for the simple comments but that is what you get with a movie with the same kind of depth,black_comedy
this is one of the worst excuses for a movie that i have ever seen it starts out showing a bunch of black guys on the chain gang then shifts to 3 white guys running down the road shackled and chained together running fast enough to catch a freight train despite the balls and chains linking them together then they come up on a man and his son who have no shirts or shoes but all of a sudden the 3 fugitives are fully clothed and ready to go then it goes downhill from there featuring some of the most godforsaken blue grass music ever perpetrated on mankind the movie makes no sense makes all southerners look like bozos and taxes the credibility of anyone with a positive iq but the public cant get enough of the music i rest my case,black_comedy
this movie was the worst movie i have ever seen  i am a big time moviegoer and i have never fallen asleep in a theatreuntil i saw this movie  the reason that i went to see it was because it was supposed to be one of the funniest movies of the year big mistake  next time ill do more research before i walk into a coen movie,black_comedy
the ratings of this movie at this site are enough to make me stop believing any of the ratings put here people this is not a movie it is an abomination modern science and mathematics fail me at this point as i cannot find a way to give this tripe a score low enough to accurately reflect its cinematic worth i can only assume i am too far out of the main stream on this whole deal as i was not even aware that homers odyssey had this particular format shoot i wasnt even aware that homer simpson had written anything and would have thought he could do better if he did nevertheless i am compelled to attempt to complete my own odyssey and rate this movie the following are my futile attempts1 negative infinity out of ten2 black hole out of five stars3 4 thumbs up the coen brothers butts,black_comedy
perhaps the fact that this film has received such high ratings in the imd  from so many reviewers is more a statement about their short attention span than it is about any alleged cinematic value of the filmi watched the film with a small group of friends so i felt compelled to sit through the entire thing otherwise i would have left and while i have certainly turned off a few vhs  dvd films at home i have never walked out of a cinema in the middle of a movie and that includes the flintstones film i can find absolutely nothing redeeming about this filmwhile the film does boast a nice array of wellknown actors none of them can do anything in this film to save it because the script is so damned awful as another review put it it should be called oh cohesion where art thou it is just a string of isolated vignettes that do not add up to any kind of unified plot the only constant is the inanityand while i have liked clooney in a few things his performances can rarely be described as multilayered or nuanced he tends toward the wooden in my opinion and here he is both wooden and flatof course different strokes for different folks so if you like it then vive la diffrence but i just dont see it,black_comedy
thought i would give a comment to balance out all those glowing reviews when i watch a movie i dont try to find a lot of symbolism or try to tie the scenes to great literature of the past i just watch movies to see what i see and enjoy it or not this was an or not for me there were very few scenes that were funny to me i did not find myself caring for any of the characters when everett just sat like an idiot while big dan clubbed his companion i lost whatever sympathy i may have had for everett i also cannot imagine that the participants in a kkk rally would march around like a high school band from the land of oz maybe that was supposed to be humorous i dont know being from mississippi i also did not appreciate that the state was presented as some exaggerated grotesque caricature of how some people probably perceive the state the scenery was also not as attractive as what ive personally seen in the state im sorry i just thought all the characters were stupid foolish selfcentered and with no common sense again maybe that was supposed to be humorous i did enjoy some of the singing but since i knew clooney was lipsynching i didnt have to be impressed with him these are not characters i would want to know nor have around me oh brother is right,black_comedy
there are a total of 291 comments till this very momentamazing countthis makes them 292no one will ever read all of themi will not talk about technical stuff and plot and bla bla blai just wanted to enter the theatre to have fun and enjoy some nice film this one was a  big fat zeronull not a single laugh for two silly hours,black_comedy
this movie is straight up bad  my friends all recommended this movie and i was hugely disappointed  this was terrible  i studied the odyssey and ill stick with the classic text  the scenery was bland and dull dont care if meant something  nothing about this film was funny  the straw that broke the camels back was the shooting of the cows by jimmy from the practice  why  i realize that my steak and burgers come from a violent process but that scene in the movie stirred up my hatred for this poor excuse of a film  the music was horrible  thankfully blockbuster let me exchange the movie that night for men of honor which was a fabulous film there was absolutely no redeeming quality in this movie the dialogue was elementary and the overall quality was poor at best,black_comedy
i think that coen brothers are two of the greatest directors of all time they are two of my favorite directors too art entertainment and cinema feeling most of their movies i have seen include all people underappreciated their last movie no country for old men and some people even hated it and say very overrated to me the best coen movies are barton fink and no country for old men however o brother where art thou was not art was not enjoyable and extremely insipid lack of cinema feeling besides coen brothers make black comedies there is black humor in their movies except for raising arizona it might be seen as black comedy too but many people say that this movie is a definite comedy it is very funny full of laughs there are a few possibilities these people may be the people who have never watched any peter sellers film robin williams film or bill murray film these people may have a very different comedy conception or these people were cheerful at that time because there was not even one moment i laughed or found funny in the movie however this is not important it was one of the worst movies i have ever seen because it was not entertaining it was not stylish not art and cinematically tasteless is there anything makes person flabbergasted astonished the only thing interesting was red kit reference it is an uninspiring adventure of three men the series of uninteresting events i wish i did not write this review because i have remembered the day i watched the movie,black_comedy
though i am not a clooney fan i saw this movie on the recommendation of this girl i met what a joke of a film the acting was average or overdone the plot was pedestrian and predictable and boring there was no clear direction in the movie to compare this piece of garbage to homers odyssey is ludicrous i think the odyssey has not been produced on film because of its complex structure and hollywoods general ignorance of this classic epic people who have not read the odyssey will be mislead by the films advertised similarities to homers timeless work unlike homers brilliance in content and presentation and organization of his long poem this waste of viewers time is a belowaverage attempt to be funny and entertaining clooney as usual exposes his average screen skills i fail to find any redeeming features in this movie and it deserves its failure at the box office i give this flick a 2 of 10 score and i am being generous,black_comedy
this film is incredibly well cast i cant praise the actors enough the three main protagonists are extremely amiable the likes of john goodman who ive never been a particular fan of to date also deserves praise for his part as do almost all of the cast list by the end youll truly find yourself attached to the protagonists and youll be invested in their wellbeing indeed the cast plays an imperative role in this productionbut they arent the only aspect that requires praisethe whole concept of the plot being centered around greek mythology is genius and works astonishingly well the whole production is very original honestly there are few films like this onebut of course the best aspect of the whole film is by far the musical contribution picking a favorite song is hard every single one is naturally catchy truthfully even if the casting was below par and the greek mythological dimension was absent from the film the music alone could probably carry it in my opinion indeed from the very opening scene the musical dimension is everpresent and never fails to deliver on the next hit im surprised to see myself write that as someone who has never been a fan of musicalsgive this one a watch for sure i havent heard a bad word about it to date and i cant imagine i ever will,black_comedy
the film is called  o brother where are thou   is directed by joel coen and having been written by his brother ethan coen the story is a hybred cross between a depression era saga and homors ancient epic the odyssey three convicts escape a chain gang and set off on a journey of discovery during the 1930s though a bit confusing the characters more than explain their philosophies and their thoughts on life each concluding that their suffering and predicaments are part of the natural order of things indeed the stars of the movie more than anything else give life to the escaping prisoners george clooney plays everett mcgill an educated conman with family troubles john turturro is pete hogwallop and tim blake nelson are his two inmate followers who share his trek across the countryside john goodman michael badalucco as babyface nelson and charles durning join the cast and are credited with the spark of good ole southern boys found throughout the story escaping from their captivity the boys search for a buried treasure and are warned by a blind man that what theyll find is not what they hope for in the meanwhile during the country election they find that their musical talents promise more than they know what is a complete surprise in this film is the singing talent of george clooney sophisticate in many other movies in this one he delights audiences with his true downhome demeanor all in all a real homespun movie which will delight audiences everywhere well done ,black_comedy
the coen brothers ought to be applauded for attempting to make a film out of the oddyssey but it goes about as well well as one would expect of a film made out of an ancient epic poem it has its moments but the narrative is too meandering to hold together clooney is fine as is the rest of the cast but the comedy is too broad to make this anything more than a curiosity piece the songs are tuneful particularly the man of constant sorrow the title of the film pays homage to the preston sturges classic sullivans travels in which joel mccrea tired of making fluff aspires to make a serious film with this title,black_comedy
america is a young country but it is not without a rich mythology we may not think of it in this way but the modern era has its folk tales and they are defined in literature theatre and of course cinema in recent years some of the best american folk tales have been woven by that eminent fraternal writerdirector team the brothers coen o brother where art thou was among their most profound yet playfulin writing this picture the brothers weave together numerous cultural motifs many of them from the movies the title itself is that of the fictional movie in sullivans travels we see depressionera legends such as the goodnatured bank robber and the blues guitarist selling his soul alongside cinematic references as disparate as the wizard of oz and doctor strangelove all this is loosely structured around homers odyssey drawing together the strands of this modern mythology with that of the ancient worldand as a directorial team the coens have a mark of simplicity and gentleness which allows the best elements of the movie to shine through the pacing of each scene is considered and languid this doesnt make things boring it allows us to savour each glorious country scene or earthy expression there is so much packed into each moment showing us a rich world beyond the storyline the coens bring out period details not through the wider shots but through seemingly inconsequential bits of background business like the copy of wards catalogue that props up hogwallops boy on his seatthe resultant movie is both witty and meaningful but also beautiful and human the brothers coen show us a people whose peculiarities are just as beautiful or as harsh as the landscapes around them filled with deliberate anachronism you are my sunshine for example was not written until some years after its set and broad stretches of logic not so much a historical movie as a mystical yet familiar dream of americas past,black_comedy
this movie is the funniest rendition of the odyssey i have ever seen bar none odysseus ulysses to us of the italian persuasion lol certainly has his hands full in his fervent quest for a return to his previous life of normalcy and always just one step ahead of the law while it is true that tim blake nelsons performance steals the show my own personal favorite is that of george clooneys and his unyieldingly optimistic albeit pseudointellectual persona as it keeps the dialogue flowing and the storyline both humorous and riveting i especially loved the soggy bottom boys in their performance of man of constant sorrow it certainly was bona fide lolbut then again coming from the petter familias lol you wouldnt expect anything less would you i would endeavor to say that another story of this ilk containing various parallels besides the movie sullivans travels is that of the more wellknown classic the wizard of oz though i cannot verify intent nor origin so although it may not be a bona fide hypothesis from which i bespeak lol there are many similarities between thembona fide or not i love this film a perfect 10 dont miss it,black_comedy
following fargo and the big lebowski writer director producer team ethan and joel coen created a film no one could have expected viewers will enjoy the performances of clooney turturro and nelson as implied the cinematography is lush and cgi is skillfully interwoven into the decidedly analog time and place represented herein solid and memorable musical performance and soundtrack add an integral sonic dimension to this barnstormin hoedownoh brother where art thou is nostalgic psychedelia the story and scenes float as if suspended in a lava lamp or in the calm aftermath of flooded river valley the picture is show not tell there is literally no telling in the film the plot is steeped in thick christian revelry but its literally basis homers odyssey predates the gospels by hundreds of years again its not a matter of complete comprehension what you see is what you get what you want to see the music group rem comes to mind with their speakingintongues folklore for america this is cultural kudzu for the coen brothers rococo trials and tribulations lush an once the film is both frivolous but then again profound in greil marcuss book the shape of things to come he begins by expounding the ideology of america as an ideal  idea that can be applied to the film here is an american moment in a pseudomythology anachronistic a steampunk history impossible possible,black_comedy
whether or not you actually like them noone could accuse the coen brothers films of not being distinctive a zany indeed stupid although still highly enjoyable comedy about a hairgel obsessed prison escapee played by george clooney set in a lovingly created bastardisation of the depressionera american south underpinned by the music of that time and the music surprisingly is treated with some reverence however farcical the other elements of the movie to its credit its funny and quite unlike any other film youll have seen before to its detriment as with a lot of other coen films its not especially emotionally engaging and theres little in the way of coherent plot just a ramble through the brothers strange imagination as for the claim in the opening credits that its based on homers odyssey there are some nods in this direction but dont expect anything too literal just remember that fargo was based on a true story in the same fashion,black_comedy

i first learned about this movie years ago possibly around the time it was first released and first heard i am a man of constant sorrow from the soundtrack soon afterwards however it wasnt until just over a year ago that i finally actually saw o brother where art thou i guess that was because i didnt watch many movies during the early 2000s with my first viewing i wasnt amazed but it was still enough for me to give positive feedback and i dont think that changed with my very recent second viewingthe story is loosely based on the ancient poem the odyssey by homer but takes place in mississippi during the great depression of the 1930s ulysses everett mcgill pete and delmar are three convicts who escape from a chain gang after doing so they set out on a journey to reach the buried loot that everett speaks of along their way they encounter many people who influence their trip and may cause them trouble including sirens a crazy bankrobber named george babyface nelson a bible salesman named big dan teague a ku klux klan lynch mob etc trying to avoid being caught is not the only challenge that these three convicts have to face im not sure about the first time i watched this but while i watched it a second time i had trouble staying into it early in the film and trouble seeing the motion picture as much of a comedy however i eventually found myself more into it and started laughing more even though i may not have found any of the gags absolutely hilarious overall a good comedy adventure not great but good with the memorable i am a man of constant sorrow song as well as some crazy characters which is mostly what makes it funny for those who want that,black_comedy
i just recently signed up to imdb and this is my first review i saw this movie a few years ago and loved it although it was only during the second watch i fully appreciated it the plot is well thought out and includes all the events of homers odyssey the humour is hilarious and there are many great characters even if they only appear in one scene i am a fan of george clooney and he plays ulysses everett mcgill brilliantly the music is also a very enjoyable part of the film with its soundtrack winning album of the year ive recommended it to a few friends and they thought it was great as well i give it a definite 1010 and as i said in the title this is my favourite movie i would highly recommend it for anyone,black_comedy
i saw this movie in the theater when it first came out and loved it then when it became available to own on vhs and then later dvd i bought it ive seen it probably 25 times and each and every time i see it i glean a bit more from iti love everything the coen brothers do this being their best in my opinion every line i mean every line is genius the comedy is often subtle or dark but some is outright im not familiar with homers odyssey which the movie is very loosely based on but actually bought a copy of the book to further engross myself in this movie to see the correlations besides the cyclopsterrific acting terrific music humor action romance comedy drama does it lack anything no is the answer the coen brothers combined brain is a theatrical genius to me no movie made prior or since by them or anyone comes near the caliber of the brilliance of this movie do not miss it or the soundtrackjust a note i dont pick movies apart i look at the total package this one is a 90 minute vacation of pure enjoyment,black_comedy
i spent 5 months defending our country from inside a dark little tent in pakistan the air national guard guys from alabama that i was stationed with made me watch this almost every day these 4 guys knew every line of this movie and would act it out as we watched it every time i have now seen this movie well over a hundred times and i still laugh every time i watch it partly from memories of those guard guys with their hysterical accents and partly because its just such a great movieit is not often that a comedy can be so smart beautiful and funny at the same time i love how the coen brothers capture music in their films using authentic music of the area and time is so much better than a standard orchestraplease watch this movie if you are a teacher please have your students watch this movie there is so much that you can talk about and any way to get people better acquainted with classic writers such as homer is a great thing,black_comedy
its an absolute crime that this movie is not in the top in the top 250 actually its a crime that its not in the top 10 i reckon it should be about number 9 shame on all the people who have voted on this movie this movie is truly impossible to categorize into one genre it succeeds as a drama musical action movie love story and comedy all in equal doses i might add that it succeeds brilliantly at all levels this is the movie where i finally gained respect for george clooneys work and have been a huge fan ever since actually all the performances were top notch the soundtrack is the best movie soundtrack ever and ive been a fan of bluegrass music ever since the most underrated movie ever,black_comedy
ive seen this film three times now and each time i find new reasons to love it it  just  gets  better the scenery is exactly right the casting was a1 the acting is great and everything fits together like a jigsaw puzzlei cant say enough good things about this film but since we have a minimum requirement on imdb ill try to say more oh right i really love the music in this film i dont care that clooney didnt do his own singing the lip sync was very good and the pieces chosen for inclusion reminded me of my grandfather and my father who knew how to make that kind of music but on the fiddlethis should be a required view for all students in american schools sure it aint histry but its derned close ahem,black_comedy
this film hits every mark needed to qualify as a true classic im not a slapstick comedy fan and i dont enjoy the juvenile situation comedies so this film was indeed a curiosity to me when it was first released since it was based on the odyssey but i had no earthly idea that its purely american themes of prison convicts on the lamb stumblingsinging ones way to instant fame seeking an imaginary fortune and political opportunism would meld into a story that is both charming and thanks to homer intricate the coen brothers were extremely fortunate to have cast george clooney as the quicktalking philosopher everet and tim blake nelson as the simpleminded but revolutionary delmer john turturros pete is oscar worthy enough said the much glorified soundtrack is pure inspiration and deserves much credit for making this film so remarkable the three stooges never had so many wonderful discussions nor displayed the innocence that the soggy bottom boys put into their efforts being steeped in old timey is one of this films best qualities for the cinematography is remarkably characteristic of the depression laden south and the coens use dixies traditions and its institutions to their full advantage this is a dont miss film and one of the alltime best comedies,black_comedy
oh brother where art thou is the odysseybased musicfilled coen brothers title that stars three men everett delmar and pete who have escaped from their prison work everett delmar and pete end up looking for a treasure which is buried by everetts cabin along the way the three encounter many obstacles such as sirens bible salesmen horseeating family members and a cow on a cotton roof which really isnt an obstacle this movie is pretty unique and funny at the same time the story and music may be a bit unoriginal but the jokes certainly are they arent slapstick or complete randomness but a bit clever and silly at the same timefilled with jokes and tons of bluegrass music there is some more appeal added into the movie though some of the movie really depends on your sense of humor and taste in music it is a great film nonetheless it also spawned one of the greatest quotes in movies damn were in a tight spotthose coen brothers also known for comedies such as fargo and the big lebowski sure know comedies810,black_comedy
i dont exactly understand the meaning of the title probably something to do with country folk or the time that the characters were living in but it is a good film from the coen brothers this is quite an interesting story about some escape prisoners with some accent on the run and trying to get on with a new life golden globe winning george clooney as ulysses everett mcgill is really good and if it was really him he is good at singing on the way clooney and his two companions pete john turturro and delmar odonnell tim blake nelson meet farm people some police and a kkk group run by big dan teague john goodman also starring holly hunter as penny although the ending is a tiny bit unlikely and confusing the rest is still a film to watch it was nominated the oscars for best cinematography and best writing screenplay based on material previously produced or published it was nominated the baftas for the anthony asquith award for film music best cinematography best costume design best production design and best original screenplay and it was nominated the golden globe for best motion picture  comedymusical george clooney was number 72 on the 100 greatest movie stars and he was number 7 on the 100 greatest sex symbols very good,black_comedy
when those first lines of odysseys appeared i thought woo these guys are really humorous then after a funny western ballad the rodomontade line came out that read based on homers odysseys it really made some sense on that the sirens they are er they are beautiful and the cyclops er he is really strong it is funny that in homers epic ulysses was cursed by poseidon but in this film those guys was finally saved by a flood as well as ulysses was smote hip and thigh while homers odysseus killed all those suitors heroically yes a highly enjoyable film with a couple of lovely ballad and brilliant images that pleasing to both the eye and the mind but i am not sure what does that black man who sold his soul to the evil stands for,black_comedy
i cant think of a more enjoyable film ive seen in the last 10 years or so its a feel good movie that does just that others have said its a film that can be watched over and over thats very true for those that just dont get it or harp on about the homers odyssey tie in i really think youve gone to see the film without an open mind i never read a thing about the movie before i saw it except it was a coen bros film thats all i needed to know millers crossing raising arizona barton fink fargoetc etc have any other filmmakers turned out so many classics in such a short space of time  o brother is another coen classic 10 out of 10,black_comedy
its another terrific coen movie it might be classified as a drama yet in my opinion its both drama and comedy the story is situated in eeuu in the 1920s however it is based on homers odyssey three escaped convicts looking for an inexistent huge sum of money go through hilarious adventures and meet very strange real and nonreal people as bankrobber george babyface nelson sirens a fast talking one eye bible seller and a lot of the kkk members its got excellent characters and beautiful landscapes clooney and turturro have very good performances the soundtrack is one of the best ive ever knowworth seeing,black_comedy
just the coen brothers riding the success of fargo and i think the ride has to stop  though this movie isnt as bad as the truly awful hudsucker proxy it has the same queasy elements worst of all being the coen brothers penchant for trying to recreate the cinematic style of the 1930s as they did in hudsucker proxyi did enjoy the three characters played by clooney turturro and nelson and really enjoyed watching them perform as the soggy bottom boys i hope have that right its from memory  the movie would have been much better if it had been about the group and a musical tour of the south they do instead of the whole lame odyssey thing  the musical moments were definitely the best parts,black_comedy
after having seen fargo i expected a lot of this movie but i never enjoyed it very mucha pity even the coen brothers can make boring movies hope the next one will be better greetings from holland,black_comedy
o brother may be seen as a nice movie including kids as it is funny and dynamic but movie is much more than that first music and songs are excellent i even bought the audio before finally going for the dvd  second the adaptation of ulysse myths in a prisoner escape is a great challenge and is perfectly mastered actors are great and sober playing the dumbs and fools is especially difficult and perfectly performed i put a 9 ranking as the project was very risky and was a way to make a stupid movie and result is a great one  congratulations to the team ,black_comedy
first off oh brother is one of the funniest movies ever made it has most of the classic coan brothers style and cast john tuturro george clooney and timblake nelson all give outstanding performances its loosley based on homers odessey but theres no ships just a long jouney where nothing is as it seems the music is greati never liked bluegrass till i saw this movieand the acting is even better the coan brothers are at their best in this hillarious movie,black_comedy
well i had my doubts when i decided to watch it but i found that the music of this movie really made it unique i found myself waiting for the next musical number george clooney did a great job on a character that he dosent usually play  i give it a 95 out of 10 and would recommend it to all,black_comedy
great movie i really enjoys all the spectacular scenes in this movie i love the fact that you newer can predict what is about to happen next and i really enjoy the actors overall high performances i rank this movie higher than for instances the big lebowski another great coen moviesee it you will not be disappointed,black_comedy
one thing that makes o brother where art thou stand out is its incredible soundtrack its probably one of the most popular soundtracks since saturday night fever man of constant sorrow is one particular song that sticks in your head other than the great music there are many funny scenes and all the characters are very likable o brother is loosely based on homers oddysey but i thought they didnt need that to tie in with the story 3 convicts on the run from the law is good enough that would be my only complaint about it some people are always complaining how unrealistic george clooneys perfectly straight and white teeth are but reallywho caresall in all this is one damn entertaining movie george clooney in his golden globe winning performance proves just how great an actor he ismy rating 910,black_comedy
have the coen brothers ever made a bad film  i mean really they always have topnotch acting their writing is always excellent the direction cinematography and editing is always superb  o brother where art thou gets even better when you see what they did to get the get that great dust bowl era look full of quirky characters as in all of their film this movie gets better and better with each viewing  excellent music and well thought out story adaptation have me giving this one a 910,black_comedy
it has been several months since i watched this movie and i still get tickled when i think about it  my daughters and i laughed about it for a long time  the acting and music were wonderful  it is definitely a little strange and probably not for everyone but we really loved it and i plan to buy a copy for myself,black_comedy
starring george clooney john turturro and tim blake nelsona trio of jailmates escape from their chain gang and must run away from the lawamong other things to  they meet all sorts of new characters on the way including racists and othersthe movie is quite possibly the best movie of 2002  if not one of the best films ive ever seenthe screenplay is brilliant the acting is brilliant the plot is brilliant among many other brilliant thingshighly recommended,black_comedy
george clooney cements his position as one of todays finest actors this is one of those classic movies like forrest gump or its a wonderful life that does not fit into any predefined category  it is not a comedy but it is hilarious  it is not a drama but it has a gripping storyline  the main thing consistent with other classics is that you really care about the characters and what happens to them  full of ironic twists and turns great great movie,black_comedy
the first time i saw this movie i almost busted a gut from laughing  the three main characters pete delmar  everett bust out of a chain gang to go find buried loot  along the way they meet all types of strange characters  from a blind seer pushing a hand cart to the kkk and other outlandish charactersthe music in this film adds to the country setting  a most enjoyable film i highly recommend for those who enjoy a good laughperhaps this movie would have had a better box office performance had the title been different,black_comedy
one of the few movies that i watched more than a few times  excellent soundtrack hilarious script deep in philosophy the movie in itself rekindled an interest in bluegrass and old timey music george clooney both imitates clark gable in the movie an imitation in life as clooneys performance in this movie shows him to be like gable master of both the dramatic and comic,black_comedy
to be perfect or not to be perfect thats the question today in cinema and its industry you have a little chance to find a movie in such a perfect harmony its direction performances editing scenes costumes  are great but above all transferring contents of a novel by homer into such scenario is really brilliant all these elements make this movie perfect and breath taking yes truly i believe this one of the best movies that i have seen in my whole life and believe me i have seen lots of movies,black_comedy
great fun wonderful in tone beautifully shot and well acted by clooney and the others this is a mustsee movie i liked the 30 usa feel the dialogues the originality and of course the singing two or three scenes are still with me even though i saw the movie more than a year ago i am a man of constant sorrow well not after seeing this one a nice flick to have on dvd as well 885,black_comedy
i was really disappointed with the usa movies i saw these days until i found this pleasant and humorous onegeorge clooneyone of my favorite actordid a good performance in this filmmaybe he alway acts in the same style in all his moviesbut thats the way he is and i like the waythe most outstanding point of the movie that hit me isnt the welldone storyline originating from homer but the great countryfolk and blues music in itthat really made me feel like being in the 1930s mississippithe songs and music are really funny and impressingthe ost is also excellentit deserves a 910 score,black_comedy
this movie was brilliant although it takes a lot of understanding of the humor twisting homers original book  this movie is not for everybody but if you have a respect for filmmaking you should see this movie  george clooney did an outstanding job as ulyses while his clumsy side kicks made you laugh constantly  the coen brothers did a brilliant job recreating this book into a visual masterpiece  i recommend while you watch it you think of all the creativity it took to use the characters from an ancient novel and put them in a film set in mississippi  funny from start to finish a must see for all minds willing to respect this movie,black_comedy
speaking as an englishman i cannot comment on the films authenticity but as an evocation of my impression of the deep south of the twenties only two movies compare cool hand luke and the title i cant remember with tony curtis and sidney poitier what it does have that they dont is a sense of humour it has no equal it is one of the best films i have seen in years george clooney shows a talent i have never seen before as do his two costars charles durning has always been wonderful but if i have a criticism of the film he is a bit ott see it and think about it,black_comedy
after the first two minutes of getting used to clooneys dialogue and delivery  the film takes off and never stops  homer surely had something else in mind  but apart from an excellent film one finally realizes  its all about the music  watch it  over and over and over,black_comedy
this movie is yet another gem from the coen brothers possibly their best yet  i have heard people talk about this movie and they either love it or they hate it  as with their movie fargo it is more about the characters during the journey they take than the ludicrous story that is laid out if you are the type of person that gets stuck on the story without recognizing the subtle nuances presented visually symbolically and verbally then dont bother  you will miss the point entirely  i recommend this movie highlyso sit back and enjoy the purity of the characters created by the coen brothers and the skilled actors that play them so wonderfully  you wont stop laughing,black_comedy
oooohw yesh this is one heck uvva movie mr george clooney plays the smarter one of a threesome broken loose from a chain gang theyre on a mission to collect 12 million dollars that he robbed what his companions do not know is that clooney has a hidden agendaon their way to the treasure they meet various people who show the threesome what the values of life are in a quite unconventional way mind youthe coen brothers have made a beautiful movie that brings mississippi of the 20s to life beautiful colors grace the white screen while acting is top notch great movie must see910,black_comedy
if youre young at heart youll find this a very entertaining and surprising film  yes there are many plot twists and funny scenes  george clooney does a great job with his role  bottom line the story is original it is set in mississippi where three prisoners escape in search of buried treasure  what happens next well you can find out for yourself oh and the music is just awesome  overall wonderful movie in all aspects  i give it at least a 910,black_comedy
ive been a fan of coen brothers movies for ages but this is probably my favourite so farits funny the music is great what can i say i blame my parents and it has the clooney factor too,black_comedy
brilliant the coen brothers have done it again their mix of homers story and american history makes for a great film i havent met one person who has seen it who doesnt like it the way that the editors changed the colors of almost every scene gives it the exact feel for the exact moment the characters are superb and there is just enough comedy drama and action,black_comedy
this was a delightful showcase for george clooney as well as a fun trip through a surrealistic south  the music alone was well worth the price of admission but the fast patter of humor in the dialogue was a treat as well very well made  and now i shall runnoft,black_comedy
this is one of the best movies ive ever seen  the acting thecharacters the music  its all there to make for one funny entertaining movie,black_comedy
i was surprised that this movie was so unbelievably entertaining at first then it continues to impact the country music industry returning its focus on its origins  george clooney and supporting cast were tremendous this has been the biggest surprise and blessing in years from the movie industry,black_comedy
i was expecting this movie to be a b or a c because i had never heard of it before seeing it listed on the cable lineup  i love george clooney but since it was not hyped up all over the news papers i figured it must have been a bomb  it wasnt  it turned out to be an a in my book hopefully it will become a cult classic,black_comedy
i never ever will get tired of watching this movie  it is absolutely awesome  the acting writing direction costumes and filmography are all top of the linesome comments here   well wow  if you didnt like that film im sorry for you  youre obviously missing out on a lot in life,black_comedy
this movie is an incredible blend of homers odyssey and a very creative story  the music is beyond compare of any movie put out that year  the cast is incrediblethree inmates break out of a chain gang to seek a treasure  in running they encounter all kinds of adventures an old man who prophesies that theyll get treasure but not that which they seek 2 of the fugitives get saved and they meet a guitarist who helps them become a hit bandi cant think of a single thing wrong with this moviethe dvd version includes a video of man of constant sorrow one of the incredible songs on this movie but youll want to view this over and over again and hear all the music and see the adventure again and again,black_comedy
ok i am using a friends screen name but even though i am only 14 i appreciate the excellence of this film half of my friends dont even know what the odessyi know i spelled it wrong by homer is  let a lone how it related to the film the is the most wonderful and unique films i have ever seen given it is a bit steriotypical it is still great i really like the attitude of everettlol,black_comedy
ive always hated musicalsive always hated everything related to musicals in any wayive always hated george clooneys conceitful actingi loved o brother where art thouthe coen brothers have a magical touch of turning anything into artthe movie is hilarious and witty with beautiful cinematography and great great directing and for once george clooneys ego has been harnessed to good use in his selfironic role definately the best odyssey filmatization ive ever seen and worth every minute of your timego rent now,black_comedy
this film was something different at least to me i had to admit that im not those who knows every actor every classic movie or anything like that i just watch movies and enjoy it so back to movie it was great work theres no much shooting or anything else kind of action but it really have some good humor and nice atmosphere although it sometimes gets near to that over fun status which i personally dont like it never really cross the line so the jokes and comedy parts are really enjoyable there surely is some strange parts of the movie which only makes it less boring to watch theres also a lot of musical parts of this movie and even if i dont usually listen that kind of music it somehow made me feel like buying a sound track id say that it earns its points and even a place in top 250 movies theres a better ones but still i would be happy to watch this anytime again and this is my first review so any comments or advises would be appreciated,black_comedy
the coen brothers have a history of putting out incredibly smart and funny and very violent films with great cinematography this film is probably the least gratuitous of theyre films but thats not neccesarily a bad thing the movie is still refreshed with the coen brothers authentic flavor and you feel happy to be taken on this voyage afterwards a truly enjoyable movie,black_comedy
im a big fan of the coen brothers and i think this is one of there best films well at least it is the one that is the most fun watching if you compare the different coen brother films youll see that every film has its own style and use of colours and no two films are the same because of this every coen brothers movie is a surprise and this one certainly isthe story is about three prisoners who escape and go on a quest to find the treasure one of them as hidden before he ended up in prison from the moment they escape the most strange and amazing events start to happen at least that is how the viewer and the three main characters experience everything in reality nothing strange happens but the coen brothers succeeded in making every little thing that happens seem very mysterious for example three women who are washing their clothes in the river sounds like nothing mysterious but the coen brother make you believe the three women are sirens the movie is full with little things like this which makes it some kind of eerie thrilling fairytale in which everything seems and is possiblethe events occurring are not solely eerie end thrilling as told previously but are also good for a lot of smiles yes smiles not laughs it is not a comedy but it is a feel good movie and a good one if the film ends you will have a big smile on your face which will not disappear for quite some time the movie feels like a walk through a fairytaleforest and that feeling will stay with you for some dayslike in the coen brothers movie fargo the most important colour was white this movie also has one most used colour this time it is brown and yellow in every shot these colours are present and dominant also there is a lot of use of filters those two things together give the movie the dreamy mysterious appearance because of this the movie is full of beautiful shots and even that alone makes it worthwhile to see the movieto conclude if you want to see a movie which is fun to watch gives you a happy feeling has a good and unpredictable story gets you thinking has great actors and sublime directing than this is the movie you want to see,black_comedy
to truly appreciate the brilliance of this film you must view it more than once  there are so many witty comments  that it is impossible to catch them all in just one viewing  george clooney is at the top of his game playing the tonguetied phrase mangling everett remember  watch it at least twice,black_comedy
without question this film is a garden of endless delights i saw it twice in theatres in first run then again on dvd and many more times as it plays on cable  the dialogue sparkles with eccentric turns of phrase the acme of foolishness for instance and the sound and music are glorious  the dvd commentary provides insight about color processes and other enhancements to create this visually ravishing film  the classic story receives a fresh review with more than a passing reference to preston sturges great film sullivans travels  if youve never seen that one its a must especially after viewing o brother where art thou,black_comedy
dont the rest of you the man obviously loved the movie hey so did i you either love or hate this movie and even if it moved you you just cant help poking fun at it more great lines than forrest gump another loveitorhateit film music that makes bluegrass fans out of old time rockandrollers and a plot that goes back a few thousand years the digital manipulation was astonishing my favorite thing about this movie its truly a film for all ages kiddies old enough to handle the pg language through old geezers who were around in the depression will all find something to love thanks coens i seem to be the only one who remains unaffiliated,black_comedy
i am sorry i really am i just cant understand how anyone could enjoy this movie despite the great acting it displayed it was a pretty unpredictable movie that left me angry i will never look at john goodman the same way ever again do yourself a favor and dont damage your intellect by seeing this movie,black_comedy
overall i thought this was an excellent film  it contains very artistic filmwork mixed with a unique plot and storyline  this movie making technique usually makes for a successful outcome with the public the only thing i thought could have been better in the movie was george clooneys character  you see he was supposedly a traveler born and raised in mississippi but his acting was not very convincing  sure he had the southern lingo very well but what about the accent  his two friends in the movie pete and delmar were a couple of countrified hicks and their acting was very convincing  then there was george clooneys character  he made it seem like he was a yankee hanging out with a couple of rednecks  and that is not what this movie was about however i thoroughly enjoyed the wellassembled cast such as john goodman holly hunter and charles durning who was my favorite character supplying most of the comic relief in the film  it is obvious that a lot of planning was put into the production of o brother where art thou and i give this movie a 9 out of 10,black_comedy
i didnt hate this movie it has some likeable pieces  i enjoyed some of the music i liked george clooneys character and his two cohorts were entertaining too but the story was weird and left my husband and i looking at each other afterward asking what was the point  like i said didnt hate it  but didnt like it either,black_comedy
it is hard to believe that the greatest filmmakers in the business were responsible for this below average film let me just say that raising arizona and the big lebowski are my two all time favorite films heck millers crossing and blood simple are as well these are two incredible filmmakers the best however this film was a dud very blah and cookie cutter just not your standard coen greatness maybe i am being too hard but i dont think so in most coen films the greatness comes from the assortment of crazy characters that is what is sadly missing here john goodman and john turturro are both wasted george clooney is good but not enough to carry the film a lot of old coen favorites make cameos but they look to be tacked on and not much else i am sure that these legendary filmmakers will get it back but this one was sadly lacking,black_comedy
this film is neither fun nor funny to watch  clooney is awesome the other two guys okay but the storyline is senselessly random  it would have been good if it were funny but its not  a big disappointment from the coen brothers,black_comedy
this is the worst film that the coen bros have ever made i was looking forward to this film for quite a while but was severely disappointed i generally like the coens very much but this has missed the mark while it still contains some of their signature eccentricity i feel that this was created to please the masses it seemed to cater to a different audience the cinematography certainly had its moments the klan scene and i laughed once or twice but overall i could not wait for it to end to be kind the characters were drab more often they were just obnoxious unfunny and sometimes completely unbelievable most of the time i get annoyed when people say a movie had no plot however that is true of this film it meandered through the old south a good idea i admit  it could have been great and pretty much got nowhere quite uninteresting altogether on a scale of 15 1 being poor i would probably give this a 2 and hope to not hear much about it again in the future,black_comedy
in o brother the coens have really outdone themselves this adaptation of homers odessey to 1930s mississippi is an outright panic attack of sublime comedic genius students of literature would do well to consider this running commentary on the ancient epic as a poignant analysis of what makes ulysses tick clooney is perfect as the selfobsessed ulysses who is destined for greatness in spite of himself goodman is a hilariously menacing twist on polyphemus the sirens are downhome backwoods eroticism distilled the featured song is also a grabber,black_comedy
what a miserable excuse for a movie a claptrap full of tired old cliches old songs and parodies of southern people who for the most part are too dumb to even realize that they are being put on i started making a list of unbelievable situations but when i got to 20 i quit for example preachers dont baptize just anyone who ambles into the ceremony there is some preparation for the event and it should not be taken lightly the way this film does the fact that this garbage has achieved so much commercial success is a sad testimony to just how far our society has descended in its downward spiral into oblivion,black_comedy
todays color kids is brown boring tantinted brown hope you like that color because in todays video presentation of the old depressionage youll see a lot of itunfortunately i dont like that color nor the color of the bluescoffees an acquired taste and so is the ever strange o brother where art thou both i get im not blind or lack taste buds so i understand the need for such substance from either source but since this is a matter of opinion and not a factbased articlephooeynot everyone likes adam sandler but if you do chances are you dont like jim carrey and the reverse is also true comedy is very subjective here i understood the slapstick and the screwballness of it all but it wasnt my cup of brown brown tea i did not laugh once but i admired the actors balls for following the coens wherever they wanted to lead including clooneythough he only started the movie on a different track from his normal performances unfortunately about halfway through if you can get past the dirt on his face youll see the clooney youve always seen in addition neither john turturro or goodman or the coens change either it was business as usual for them they even had to throw in some classic coens animal crueltythree prisoners escape a real chain gang in the depression era  no not the late 2000s  and theyre on a mission for gold along the way they meet goofball characters do goofball things and sing aokay good songsure theres search for them there goldor an ulterior motive thats not that much of a spoiler  anyone who knows what this is based on should see where this is headedand with that they say this movies based on homers odyssey i doubt the original textpoem for which i have in fact read was meant to be this ridiculed heck where was that jim carrey to step in and start singing to watch this youll have to like the blues youll have to like george clooney wackiness barely a character to root for and the color brownsorry i just cant get over that brownish tanish tint over 98 of the movie nor could i get over this incredibly array of wacky characters so out of left field its distractingagain i get what they were trying to say and covey but it just wasnt my bag so since i know it has a select audience and you might be part of that  if you agree with what i wrote about what the films about i cant completely downrate the movie to 1 star at least i am able to acknowledge it does in fact have a following more power to those who like it im just not part of that group,black_comedy
when i first saw the preview for o brother where art thou i said to myself that film looks terrible  i am a big coen brothers fan  the big lebowski is among my favorite films and fargo is a masterpiece  however something told me to just stay away from o brother where art thou  after many months of convincing from friends that it was a great movie i picked it up what a waste of time  the preview completely captures the essence of the movie  it is a boring script that is made worse by pitiful acting performances especially by george clooney in the lead role  remember keanu reeves in dracula  thats the level of quality were talking about here clooney could stay in his pseudo southern accent for no more than 2 or 3 seconds before he relapsed back to batman or that guy on er or any of the other terrible performances he has given in the past  it was just pitiful to watch  to me the coens have always made movies that make you laugh because of the intelligent humor in them  in o brother they apparently went for slapstick and failed miserably  if i wanted slapstick i would watch chris farley and see it done much better  i hope this film is not a sign of things to come,black_comedy
why does everyone like this film and what is it with all these creative films i thought it was weird only a bit funny and maybe worth seeing once i wouldnt highly recommend it though 255 stars,black_comedy
as fun as o brother where art thou can be it has an overlong draggedout feel there seems to be less material than a 105minute feature can support and as is often the case in coen brothers movies there is minimal character development we learn a little bit about ulysses but almost nothing about anyone else in large part were willing to stick with these three individuals because the actors playing them do a good job clooney radiates charisma as he slides into character john turturro and tim blake nelson are both effective foils and the entire supporting cast falls into place the coens are master filmmakers but this is something of a misstep not by muchafter all this is the coens we are talking of but it is,black_comedy
one of the many reasons that this film and story was so successful is that it offers a true depiction and glimpse of part of depression era life in the deep south it also offers a taste of that culture social mannerism and behavior that is very interesting as opposed to sliding by with approximating the southern personality the director was able to pinpoint and authenticate the southern character and mannerism almost perfectly it shows that everyone in the production either did their research or came from that region of the country originallyhomers oddessey was well adapted to the time and place depicted here just the right amount of pathos irony comedy hard luck and hard times give the principle characters something to really work with and all of them have accomplished this in excellent fashion john turturro particularly has accomplished the quintessential down on his luck southern boy so well that he is almost the standard prototype of all timein addition to showing a historically accurate picture of southern rural life in the 30s the film also deals briefly with the then condition of the ku klux clan and its psychotic cultural behavior we see in this adaption that the average african american was not hated and hunted down by all white men but only by a small percentage of fanatical tribesman it also suggests in a more masked way that the clans behavior was highly influenced by a gangster mentality many of the participants in this behavior would not behave that way on their own but only when masked and in a large group sort of like sheep for the most part people of all colors were willing to get along at that time but like today race relations still had a ways to goanother treat was the depiction of the prison chain gang although not shown quite as hopeless and harsh as in cool hand luke oh brother does touch on the helplessness an inmate must feel albeit done with a humorous slant in this film inmates are observed getting along well with each other accepting their state of affairs and working away without too much worry frustration and fatigue in real life the chain gang was brutal to the point where many of the inmates were on the verge of collapse almost everydayfinally since this observation is mostly about the depression era south it was very enjoyable to experience the progress of the music of the region and the period when the bluegrass style was in its infancy the soggy bottom boys were great as was the audience they played for this was simply another feature of this film that was done precisely as it was when the story takes placefor anyone who has not read the oddyssey or has not been in the deep south or just wishes to enjoy a story well researched and well presented then this is the story for him it is an enjoyable film from start to finish with flair and creativity to spare,black_comedy
like the coen brothers other masterwork fargo this film was extremely well written and directed  of course homer did have a small hand in it hope you have the same response to this film as i did and that it enriches you as much as it did me  own this one it will be considered a classic in the world of film  the music is also fantastic,black_comedy
i expected to see a comedy but i got a musical instead  and it wasnt even an amusing musical either  it did have good acting performances all around but the story was very predictable used to be impossible for a coen movie  also disappointing was the plot  it was supposed to be about 3 escaped convicts on a quest for buried treasure but that couldnt have been farther from what really went on didnt want to put any spoilers therei give it 3 out of 10 for the acting alone,black_comedy
this movie started out okay and then it went from bad to worse the characters were okay but the whole thing was overall bad just when you thought it was getting better it would get worse than it was before i wouldnt recommend watching this movie at all,black_comedy
the coens use their two sources wisely if not well  like sullivans travels the narrative is not a realistic straightforward story despite the attention to period detail but a frankensteins monster made up from different bits of movies of the time the musical the gangster movie the chaingang movie the socially conscious movie like a frankensteins monster  similarly the allusions to ulysses are overturned  penelope is not faithful ulysses is beaten up by the cyclops  it depends on how you take all this  the coens suggest not too seriously  this is probably just as well because the implications of the fascist basis of american popular culture and democracy are kind of alarming  this is my least favourite coens movie irritating as much as it astonishes,black_comedy
after watching big lebowsky and fargo new koen brothers film could have been expected to be at least a funny one but please dont expect too much this is one of the worst movies of last years cast is wasted time is wasted and the impression like you are forced to laugh but you cant i had only one wish  to leave the cinema still before the end of this delirium maybe somebody could answer why should i laugh when john goodman is beating john turturro and george clooney with log or longlasting scene with wedding dancing the scene with shootingguns in the cab is copied from the previous brothers film or probably its a new film philosophy  to adopt literature classics to the hopeless wouldbe funny gags,black_comedy
i went to see this movie because a few of my friends said they liked itthere was about 35 people in the movie and not once did i hear a laugh this movie i noticed is in imdb top 250ifor onecannot figure that outit just leads to believe that my friends and the people who voted this piece of garbage in the top 250 can no longer be trusted to tell me what to see,black_comedy
any film director who decides to try to use material of homer ovid or another classic immediately deserves congratulations for the courage even if his effort wasnt positive he tried i say that because i read homer and i know how heavy this author can be its a kind of literature extremely difficult to adapt the coen brothers went a step further they took homer to the cinema in a way that hardly resembles homer they put old greek story into a new context giving it a different shape all done with the usual touch of sarcastic elegance that is the signature of these directorsthe plots main idea is simple but takes time to show itself everett ulysses mcgill is a convict who decides to flee his labor camp and try to prevent his fianc from marrying another man he takes two other prisoners who were fortunately chained together with him some moments of the film are very funny and the irony is always there sometimes we wonder where are the logic but the film quickly explains most of the illogical moments except perhaps the hundreds of pomade cans that appear throughout the film which i honestly dont quite understand in contrary to some critics i dont think reading odyssey is important to understand this movie although it helps us to notice some nebulous scenes the work of the actors is well done but no actor overlaps george clooney almost unrecognizable with an intense southern accent well maybe tim blake nelson is as good as clooney thanks to the naive way he played delmar finally a word of appreciation for the costumes and scenarios absolutely faithful to the period in which everything happens as well as the enveloping and animated soundtrack that gives life to the story,black_comedy
lets get one thing straight i despise the classics i groaned through romeo  juliet both times i had to read it for school i thought to kill a mockingbird was ridiculous and i absolutely loathed the odyssey which i also had to read twice fortunately o brother where art thou successfully updates the story and makes it accessible enjoyable and an absolute delightgeorge clooney is odysseus actually thats ulysses everett mcgill trying to get back to his wife penny holly hunter whos told their children he got run over by a train instead of war hes been working on a chain gang and instead of some kind of vengeful force he now has to elude a sinister sheriff and a cyclops bible salesman played to perfection by john goodman i cant begin to spill all the hilarity that happens within this one dreadfully short movie theres some doozies believe you me all in all this film would still be underrated if it were considered the greatest movie of all time its definitely on my top 10you shall see a cow on the roof of a cotton house,black_comedy
most people would probably never imagine transposing the odyssey to 1930s mississippi but the coen brothers pulled it off perfectly george clooney john turturro and tim blake nelson play three jailbirds named ulysses pete and delmar respectively who escape from a chain gang and subsequently travel through a world containing a blind soothsayer sirens a cycloptic bible salesman john goodman and even baby face nelson michael badalucco yep you read that right and to crown it all ulysses always needs some dapper dan pomade for his hair holly hunter plays ulysses wife penny short for penelope who has all but given up on himof course the movies real forte is its music a litany of mesmerizing folksy ballads they truly could not have come up with a better soundtrackand as a final note o brother where art thou gives new meaning to the idea of a horny toad,black_comedy
sorry but i dont know what the fuss is all about because gc is in it sure it gives a good picture of the south in the 30s and the music suited the movie but the rest is too vague for me and didnt make me laugh either and what about the part when they get robbed by john goodman they just sit there and have their heads whacked and money stolen i thought george was supposed to be the clever one and all the coincidences like the sirens and the kkk meeting and the political meeting looked more like a southern 30s blues brothers dont take me wrong i like american movies but this was just not my style,black_comedy
what on earth were the coen brothers thinking of why base a story about 1930s escaped convicts in mississippi on homers odyssey are they trying to heducate us or was it just a darn stupid ideayou know the movie is not going to work right from the beginning clooney plays an astonishingly annoying guy who prattles on in high falutin language yes yes we get it  but we still have to listen to him right through the film the characters and the situations are not funny there is not one memorable line in the whole movie perhaps the biggest sin of all the fantasy elements just make us care less scenes creak from one to the next with little meaning or continuity the quirkiness is too smug and selfconscious the injokes that presumably are meant to keep us nudging our neighbour and justify our time are too obscure and pointless the clichs pile up chain gangs breaking rocks big daddy figure running for governor kkk shenanigans all caricatures of caricatures of caricatures yawn soon we are begging to be shown something original oh the film had a nice colour wash to match the parched landscape and there was a digitised cow being run down but artificial gimmicks are not going to make me like the movie ive usually enjoyed the coens movies but o brother is a huge let down that makes me wonder how much of that all that stuff in the past was actually as good as i thought one foot either side of the fine line between between quirky genius and utter hogwash,black_comedy
this movie is way too over rated because of its simplicity you might be better off watching south park save your time i mean its so dull i have nothing else to say,black_comedy
this is not only one of the worst movies of the year its one of the worst movies ever made its like watching a train go off the track and being forced to sit there for 90 minutes and watch it crash  at the crowded screening i attended the movie was watched in stony silence every joke crashing to the ground and dying  i love many of the coen brothers movies and to see one that goes so terribly wrong is a painful experience within 5 minutes george clooney tried to deliver a  line of dialogue and the movie died  if i had known the premise  everyone in the movie is a halfwit except george clooney who dispenses pearls of wisdom i would have known better than to even attend a film with so ridiculous a plot  in other words if the film had broken at any point and they sent us home i dont think anyone would have complained,black_comedy
respectable contributions of acting directing and production are delivered in order to make light of the odyssey one of the cornerstones of literature  this film is one of the clearest indications of how modern movements bite the historical hand that feeds them,black_comedy
o brother where art thou was soooo bad that i wonder why anyone would have bothered paying for an admission ticket to see it at the theater there was no connection between the title and the plot  the acting was poor and shallow the plot was mundane it was featured as a comedy and didnt make the grade,black_comedy
i think i expected a bit more fun and fastpaced adventure from the coen brothers as their three runaway convicts try to get a better life in o brother where art thou making me feel bored at times with some of the inconsequential scenes tn,black_comedy
o brother where art thou2 and a half out of 5a tale of friendship among three free spirited friends who are on run and search for the treasure of peace and freedom the comic tone in here works which doesnt always come in handy especially when there isnt much room for it having said that the feature never attains the correct amount of intensity that it anticipated for and the primary reason is the stake projected in here that never reaches to the audienceit is short on technical aspects like background score sound effects and editing although the costume design is suitable with the tone of the feature the feature doesnt follow a rudimentary process which favors in its side along with its light and breezy tone which it stays true to throughout the course of it the screenplay by coen brothers may not be smart but is surely gripping and hilarious in its own terms addition to that joel coen the director has done a tremendous job on executing the feature despite of fumbling its way on the dramatic aspects of it the performance objective is handled decently by the protagonist george clooney where he is supported by john goodman and holly huntera confused feature seeking and bearing for art that it never is able to reach for let along grasp it,black_comedy
in the deep south during the 1930s an oddball trio of convicts led by george clooney escape from a chaingang and embark on a perilous roadtrip with the intent to retrieve clooneys hidden bank loot while the law are relentless in their pursuit the convicts encounter a number of strange characters and experiences loosely based on homers odyssey,black_comedy
having never seen a cohen movies i picked this one completely random and didnt expect anything else than a good comedy what a good surprise to find an intelligent comedy with critics about religion politics and every clich from south america were following those three men as they travel across the land where people elect the candidate setting up the best show and where religion is depicted either as a forgiving act of baptism or as a good and easy way to get money both playing with credulity the kkk and its link to both politics and religion is also well depicted while the seductive money make families betray themselves strangers sell each other or babyfaced man plan robberies a very good moment spent watching this movie cant wait to see the others,black_comedy
after a somewhat rough and mildly tedious start o brother where art thou quickly becomes a highly enjoyable adventure comedy that will likely entertain almost any type of person it is full of wit fun and beautythis is seriously one of the most well made films of the 2000s i would highly recommend watching this on a large screen because some scenes are so wild and epic that it is essential to view them with the best sound and audio quality possible on the biggest screen possible i really wish i could have made it to the theater to watch this film when it was originally released what a fun time that would have been this is a beautifully shot hilariously funny charmingly amusing and extremely well made piece of film making the performances are highly enjoyable and the performers manage to make the characters come to life in all their silly glory,black_comedy
a disjointed comedy film that takes place in the american south of the early 20th century brothers joel and ethan coen wrote produced and directed the movie intending it as a modern version of homers odyssey the film mixes serious social problems of time and place with humor and somewhat with a nod to lesser crimes in an interview joel said it was a three stooges film the acting is good with george clooney john turturro and tim nelson in the lead roles as everett pete and delmar respectively john goodman has a smoothtalking violent part as big dan teague charles durning gives one of the best performances as the governor of mississippi pappy odaniel the movie pokes fun at the type of politics of the time and at the ku klux klan and at good ole southern religion the songs and singing are some of the best part of the humor some viewers may be put off by the considerable amount of profanity i noted one thing curious about this movie it was entered in the cannes film festival in may of 2000 and then released in france on august 30 of that year it was released all over europe and elsewhere through 2000 but didnt make it to screens in the us until february 2 2001 this isnt a movie to rush out and buy but its fair entertainment with the reservations noted above for adults on an evening when one doesnt have a great film or more interesting movie to watch,black_comedy
since their entrance into the cinematic realm in 1984 when they brought birth to the thriller blood simple joel and ethan coen have proved capable of handling just about every genre they have put in front of them this feat is often accomplished by their ability to bend genres with their sardonic humor aberrant characters and narrative twists all of which is greatly demonstrated in this comedy starring george clooney tim blake nelson and john turturro as a trio of hillbillies on a crossstate adventure through the depressionera mississippi sporting up some unconventional characters fancy periodappropriate dialogue and a taste of one of the most lively musical numbers ever brought this film is just another surprise orchestrated by the coens but its a pretty good one to say the least set in 1930s this follows three hillbilly convicts everett played by george clooney pete played by john turturro and delmar played by tim blake nelson who escape from captivity in prison and wander off through the old roads of mississippi in search of a treasure everett secretly buried in the process they encounter a slew of unexpected figures including tommy johnson played by chris thomas king who sold his soul to the devil to generate his talent as a blue musician big dan played by john goodman a ruthless leader of the ku klux clan and the law enforcement who sets out to hunt them downthe coen brothers flourish a handful of surprises for a movie with a title resembling a bible verse though its confirmed that the title actually derives from a line in a 1941 film sullivans travels the film is funny eccentric and surprisingly heartfilling the minute our three main characters make their escape we are introduced to some appropriately quirky characters with eccentric southern dialogue and pop culture references that suites the 1930s period quite well from there on the story progresses on these men on some of their most colorful moments including a lively musical number that offers nothing short of charm and fun to listen to one particular involves a trio encountering three scantily clad women at a pond which leads to shockingly funny end results yes the film does leave a little wiggle room for slightly darker moments which are greatly encountered towards the final act but the coen brothers do a genuine job of not escaping their ironically humorous roots furthermore they offer just enough to surprises to make up for a few slogged scenes that dont work well as intended regardless these fine directors know how to keep things movingwhen it comes to setting a movie in the depressionera it is highly appropriate though not essential to go to great lengths to give the film the vintage look and feel of the 1930s that is where frequent collaborator of the coens filmography roger deakins and editor tricia cooke arrives into the picture deakins blesses this beauty with astounding cinematography that is nicely painted with a deep sepiatone to the film a look of an adventure set in the old mississippian times with the use of low saturation and old folk music popular during the great depression years the film effectively fosters an old timely feel of one of americas most unhappy decades it works pretty conventional but thats not all the coen brothers have an extremely nifty talent in writing dialogue and most of it shines through the strong if a bit eccentric performances by leads george clooney john turturro and tim blake nelson all of whom adopt a thick southern accent that feels authentic though slightly contrived every now and then this trio of fine actors make the best of their idiosyncratic characters with their charm and darkly funny persona and the best part is they do not their opportunities to be bring out some good laughs for granteda splendid comedic piece that sees coen brothers in one of their freshest if not classic forms it is a delightful film filled with just about everything a moviegoer can expect from filmmakers like the coens and even it is doesnt go down as a classic who can deny the immense memorability this film generates,black_comedy
in the deep south during the 1930s three escaped convicts search for hidden treasure while a relentless lawman pursues themsaying this is the coen brothers greatest film would be hard as so many of their movies are among the greatest made in the last few decades does this surpass fargo or the big lebowski some would say yes but how do you decide that lebowski is one of the biggest cult films of its generationwhat is great about this film is well everything solid acting beautiful cinematography particularly the sepia tones and a great adaptation of the work of homer classic literature does not always come across as fresh to modern generations in this incarnation it certainly does a special nod must go to tim blake nelson although not as big of a name as george clooney or john turturro he is an equal part of this comedy trio,black_comedy
if there was any way possible to do so i would be more than willing to place a worth while wager that if this movie was released without the coen name behind it it would flopwith the exact same cast effects budget  script the majority that flourish it with praise would of looked away and rightfully soi am a big fan of the coen bros movies  have many fargo labowski etc on dvds but i think that this is one project movie where they went too far with previously unexplored ambitions due to egos dominating creativity my only description of it would be a combination of an old fashioned western movie and a history lesson lacking any tale as powerful or intriguing as found in the usual coen script probably highly influenced by westerns seen as childrenas usual one or two twists as present in all movies of this type but none that separate it from a 60 minute more summarised show on the general screen surrounding its release date and today,black_comedy

loosely based on homers odyssey ulysses everett mcgill george clooney delmar odonnell tim blake nelson and pete hogwallop john turturro are escaped convicts in 1930s mississipi they travel the roads to get to everetts buried bank loot a whole lot of fanciful adventures including creek side sirens the kkk chased by sheriff cooley and an epic floodthrough it all they sing some good songs there is a lot of great fun old time music music is such an integral part of this movie and it fits the style of the movie this is a beautiful piece of art a fasttalking fantasy a sumptuous visual love letter,black_comedy
over the years ive watched this movie maybe 20 or 30 times and every time i find something new to laugh about the coen brother have crafted a hilariously dysfunctional buddy movie in o brother where art thou which never ceases to make me smile loosely based off homers epic the odyssey the story follows 3 men who after escaping from a chain gang in depression era mississipi set out on a search for buried treasure left behind by george clooneys character ulysses everett mcgill along the way they meet all sorts of quirky characters which include an unscrupulous bible salesman a horse eating redneck a bank robbing lunatic an ornery flour tycoonwho also happens to be governor a young man who sells his soul to the devil and a very peculiar blind man who owns a recording studio its safe to say the coen bros took their time fleshing out the minor roles in this film and every new character you encounter feels very original credit is also due to the actors for performing these roles but the writing in this movie is simply fantasticwhich brings me to my next point the dialogue in this script is some of the funniest most entertaining in films today everett mcgillplayed by clooney is the smooth talking seemingly overeducated convict who self appoints himself leader of the escapees and is easily the bright spot of this film clooneys character is as hilarious as he is flamboyant and is definitely one of his best acting performances to date tuturro and nelson are also quite funny as the bumbling idiot companions to mcgill as they set out across mississipi looking for the treasure some of the funniest moments in this movie involve simple conversations between the 3 and seeing the clearly uneducated companions try to make sense of mcgills over expanded vocabulary holly hunter is also great in this movie as mcgills estranged wife and adds an extra dimension to the story that is quite interesting the coen brothers are known for writing fleshed out quirky characters in their movies and this one is no exception the writing is witty and the acting is exceptional by everyone the theme is meant to be light hearted while also maintaining a sense of realism for the time period in which it is set i give them a lot of credit for staying true to the accuracy of the period but also keeping the feel of the film lighthearted and funtough to do as depression era mississipi was not a lighthearted or fun period in time at all i also have to add that the score of this movie fits perfectly mixing old time countybluegrass to perfect effect overall this is not only one of the best coen bros films but in my opinion one of the best 50 films of all time the humor ismostly clean as well so it can be enjoyed by a wider age group than many modern comedies a cant miss film by some of the best writersdirectors of our time,black_comedy
this movie is very very interesting if you like comedy and you are willing to laugh as hard as you can imagine then this is the movie for you this movie shows the lives of three young men who escaped from jail in mississippi and are trying to find a lost treasure their names are everett delmar and pete the theme for this movie would be finding a peaceful place with a little bit of struggle i choose this theme because it explains how everett delmar and pete were unhappy at the prison station and needed to find some form of peaceful place and through it all they are willing to put in all they have got just to be happy this movie will keep you entertained the whole time it is definitely a must watch,black_comedy
a comedy satire based on the historical writing of homers odyssey directed by joel and ethan coen the film stars george clooney everett john turturro pete tim blake nelson delmar the movie is set in the deep south during the great depression the three main characters are trying to break free from the mississippi state prison the ring leader is everett and he convinces the other two to break free in hopes to find a buried treasure that they must get to in four days before it is washed away the movie provides plenty of different adventures for the trio all the while they are being chased by sheriff cooley and they must stay one step ahead of the law while still maintaining their moral the characters hope the blind mans prophecy will come truethis movie offers a new and exciting way to view and interpret the film offer a wide variety of angle shots and uses panning often to show the events that played out earlier to show how and why the characters end up in the predicaments that they do music and transitions are used in comparison to guide the audience thorough rough and rowdy scenes to naturally flowing scenes this is done in such a way that the audience doesnt even know giving more attention to be paid on the film itself during the trios adventure they are constantly being followed by sheriff cooley when such scenes are present in the film the transition and editing is tenser and the music reflects also in happier times in the film the trio performs as the soggy bottom boys with much popularitythe music reflect this as well the lighting and color are used in such a way in the film to represent the sepia tone feeling that was popular during that time period this movie is very fun and exciting to watch it offers a modern day twist on the odyssey and the coen brothers keep you guessing at what will happen next i recommend this movie to anyone it offers a great storyline for young and old alike,black_comedy
george clooney plays the ringleader of a batch of escaped convicts in the depressionera south in this one of the coen brothers most obnoxious and least entertaining filmsits a jokey folksy retelling of homers odyssey which is intriguing as an idea but its done in that grotesque comedic style the coens brush off every once in a while  yes the same one used for films like burn after reading and barton fink  and which i find intolerablenevertheless the film brought the coens an oscar nomination for its adapted screenplay and it won frequent coens collaborator roger deakins a nomination for its cinematographygrade d,black_comedy
three convicts george clooney john turturro and tim blake nelson two of them dimwits the other dapper vain and smoothtalking escape from a chain gang in 1930s mississippi go searching for buried treasure and experience wildly varied adventuresextremely loosely based on homers odyssey this very funny road film with brilliant music thrown in ticks off more cultural references than you can shake a stick at yet still carves out its own shambling goofy identity tbone burnett supplied an impeccable collection of traditional country and bluegrass songs for the soundtrack o brother where art thou was the first time a digital intermediate was used on the entirety of a firstrun hollywood film which otherwise had very few visual effects,black_comedy
a visually impressive film with a great soundtrack amusing characters a few passing references to homers epic odyssey and a slightly above average plotin a lot of ways the coen brothers have taken all the elements which make a blockbuster added in a few extra ingredients of their own stirred it all together and come out with what is an enjoyable little story many people cite the films references to the odyssey as an important part of the story i dont however see this thats not to say there arent any what i am trying to say is that the film is more reliant on its own unique and interesting characteristics as opposed to those of a 4000 year old textthe colour in which the film is shot is possibly one of the most important elements in generating the character of the picture i think that shooting the picture without the colour correction which was used in o brother would of detracted from the feel of the film the dusty look sums up the character of the southern states it also gives something of a dirty and lower class feel which is perhaps important when we consider the backgrounds of the three lead charactersthe music of the film is another important element which is again one of the things the film would not be able to be as enjoyed nearly as much without the music adds to the rustic feel that the colouring of the film does it also helps push through the spirit of the era in which the film is set a particularly strong example of this is the baptism scene christianity is obviously an important part of life in ameirca and the gospel bands that have appeared in that area have spread throughout the world this scene is particularly entertaining and the music enhances the effect if they had chosen any other type of christian hymn the scene would weaken considerablyhowever i am critical of the lead actor george clooney he dominates the film in a larger then life manner but i dont think this is a good thing from the opening moments clooney grabs the film by the throat and doesnt let it go there is rarely a point where he is not centre of attention and he always seems to position himself so that he is the dominate figure in a scene even in cases where he shouldnt be the scene in the barn is particularly irksome with clooney hogging the camera i was amazed to learn that he earned a golden globe for this performance because i really think that this is george clooney at his screen hogging worsti wont however fault what is an otherwise entertaining film on the basis of one actor it is overly an interesting and enjoyable film it is not something which i would ever own or even something i would go out of my way to watch but nonetheless i think it has a unique appeal and is certainly something worth having seen at least once,black_comedy
the coen brothers 2000 film too much of too many slightly to reasonably good ideas patched up and sprayed all over the screen at once the film will cover so much ground in terms of the flicking between genres grounded content offthewall content and tacked on character development that it just all fuses together and comes away somewhat of a mess with hindsight we can all say that films like o brother where art thou represent one of two different sorts of films the coens have in them some of their best pieces of work are restrained looming ominous and quite grim however they have this tendency to throw these sorts ingredients out the window from time to time and just come up with stuff and i do mean stuff in inverted commas thats wacky carefree loud trying too hard to be funny and just generally obnoxiousone of those films a film thatll shoot all over the place with absolutely no shame whatsoever encompassing musical numbers bank heists a general sense of chase as they run from authorities as well as an electoral campaign running on a separate equilibrium between the film beginning and ending some pretty far reaching material will have unfolded within a pretty small proximity of area the unfortunate thing is that were never given a chance to take any of it in and were never given much of a chance to pause and reflect the film is in so much of a hurry to shift onto the next funny or quirky encounter with the next misfit that none of films characters encounter hold any sort of dramatic weight and thus do not add up to anything a little of o brother where art thous approach goes a long wayon paper the film shouldve worked a lot better than it did a coen brothers film about three escaped convicts in 1930s deep south america running from the law in the hope to unearth some self proclaimed treasure hidden out there somewhere only one prisoner of whom knows its whereabouts the additional catch is that they only have a few days to find it because where its buried will be flooded shortly yes yes yes  hand me that premise in the hands of these two guys and id lap it up anytime anyday but somewhat annoyingly what we get is a hodgepodge of a piece a stumbling and fumbling picture attempting to create comedy out of a young mans simplistic mindset a film that uncomfortably straddles the line between realism and escapism with its alltoo coincidental chance encounters and general outrageous content blended in with its sharp attention to the three guys throughout as they need to change clothes find food garner money discover places they can safely rest and be able to maintain a consistent speed of travel in whatever capacitythe three men out and on the run are tim blake nelsons delmer john turturros pete and another individual named everett clooney whose authoritarian presence dwarfs the other two somewhat by being the one claiming to know where the loot from a raided armoured van is hidden their roadmovie inspired journey is introduced somewhat obviously and somewhat crudely by a camera shot which begins on ground level by a railway track before shamelessly craning upwards to encompass a the rest of the single railway track going off into the distance thus informing us of the singular line voyage these leads will go on this occurs mere seconds after some kind of prophetic blind man lays out the long and spiritual journey the characters are to go on from here its all very selfaware allvery postmodern and all very sillybut what of the journey for a film to adopt that singular line strand narrative arc what happens certainly unfolds in the crudest and elementary of fashions i dont think theres much sense that these characters have progressed an awful lot from the point their journey begins to the point the film rounds everything off the coens play a couple of wildcards to create the illusion that the characters do so one of which occurs very early on when a local christian congregation are baptising people in a river and two of the stowaway prisoners take up the chance to supposedly rid themselves of sin but this is a stark and jarring occurrence that takes the character from one extreme item to another the films in a rush and rather than allow these guys to bond and figure things out for themselves in terms of who they are and what they ought to be doing in life one scene very early on prematurely thrusts certain leads from criminalexprisoner to apparently reformed citizena lot of the quest can unfold in any order it likes theres no flow or consistency to any of these guys misadventures an encounter with some sirens a coming across a oneeyed conman interactions with a bank robber some altercations with the police  its all loud garbled nonsense and can unfold in any order you want it to while i found some of these wacky and outrageous encounters further pull me away from the focus of the leads and their supposed goal of finding the loot twinned with this is a somewhat disturbing overtone of gunplay or gunfire made funny early on a shotgun wielding kid will provoke a wouldbe humorous encounter with the criminals trying to get back on their feet bankrobber nelsons badalucco eccentric attitude as he fires off tommy gun rounds im sure spawns a few laughs amongst others while the exploding ammunition in the police truck probably does the same thing but by the time a certain rug has been pulled from underneath us linked to the premise and weve had a series of country and western warblings i think were just about ready for o brother to end,black_comedy
it was a nicely shot movie with a definite feel for the era but the storyline left something to the imagination many nods to the source material homers odyssey but the original made the adventures much more thrilling whereas in this movie it just seemed to be a bunch of random events strung togetherclooney was ok but the best character had to be his short sidekick john goodmans role is actually quite small holly hunter another top billed actor in this movie has a role thats even smaller overall i found it mildly amusing mildly entertaining and therefore only mildly recommended,black_comedy
i was disappointed when i watched this movie because i had heard so much about it i found a couple of bits slightly funny but it seemed to drag a bit just after halfway through so that i fell asleep while watching it for the first half hour george clooney overacted so that his character was just irritating the dimwitted redneck boys were a racial stereotype as were many of the characters  why was that acceptable while racially stereotyping an africancaribbean man was selfconsciously not i think more could have been made of don goodmans character which was larger than life and comical i was intrigued at how the directors handled the race issue since it was set in a historical context  i think they just about passed but tackling it was just asking for trouble i liked the music soundtrack i didnt like the assumption that we can have sympathy for convicts especially clooneys character that made me feel uncomfortable some difficult moral aspects were tackled efficiently others left a nasty taste in the mouth a movie to see just to say you have seen it,black_comedy
like most coen brothers films that ive seen this had a surreal quality to it very loosely based on the odyssey it follows the adventures or three convicts on the run after escaping from their chain gang in rural mississippi during the depression everett ulysses mcgill george clooney there self appointed leaded has told the others that he has over a million dollars from a robbery unfortunately the area he has buried it in is due to be flooded to make a reservoir in four dayson they journey the meet a variety of interesting characters a blind oracle who tells them they will find treasure but not that which they expected a man who had sold his soul to the devil to play the guitar three very alluring sirens and a one eyed character played by john goodman amongst others much of the story involves music in fact at one point they even make a record to earn a few buck then unknown to them it becomes a hitthe story telling is superb as is the acting while at times it feels more like a collection of incidents rather than a single story that is no bad thing as each incident that happens along the way is interesting and usually amusingif you want to watch something a little bit different which contains little to offend and much to amuse then this could be the film for you,black_comedy
a funny exciting at times emotional and all out comedy adventure of three escaped convicts in search of treasure whilst being pursued by lawmen it is tightly based on homers the odyssey and takes place in the deep south during the 1930s george clooney plays everett a man of big ideas but no real sense john turtorro plays pete and tim black nelson plays delmarwhy i say this is an instant classic is the adventure comedy aspect both pay of tremendously well all throughout the film i cant think of any other bunch of talented actors who could uphold the funniness like clooney turtorro and nelson couldall in all a timeless and epic achievement that one could be happy enough to watch over and over,black_comedy
what is it about our society today that we are so obsessed with the media the media influences our lives so much that people say movies are part of the reason for teen violence it seems that every time a good book is made we as a society have to turn it into a movie this is no exception with the novel the odyssey in some of the best possible ways the coen brothers included the most significant events of that novel in their movie o brother where art thou for example the first major parallel that existed between the book and the movie was the singing village ladies in the epic the sirens were a major obstacle to odysseus and his crew their singing voices drove them crazy made the men fall in love with the women and drove them off course similarly the singing women in the movie pull the three men off course the men fell in love with the appearances as well as the voices of these pretty ladies and consequently let their guard down to the police once these singing women caused the men to be less aware of their surroundings the police where able to capture pete and hold him hostage in addition despite the fact that the cyclopes is a mythical creature the coen brothers still managed to put this significant event in the movie it is amazing how they thought of putting a one eyed giant man in the movie who created obstacles for the boys just like the cyclopes monster caused major set backs for odysseys and his crew their uncanny ideas should have captured the minds of any people watching this movie lastly the major predicament of the suitors that odysseus faced was captured and successfully translated into the movie as well just as odysseus wife was surrounded by men who wanted to marry her penelope was engaged to a new husband at the time when everett returned home the writers of the movie even managed to put the words hes a suitor into the movie which truly indicate that the same problem was evident in both story plotsalthough the coen brothers did one of the best possible jobs translating the odyssey into a modern day film that novel should never have been translated into one in the first place the odyssey is one of the most popular and widely known books in america and in other countries as well the imagination and creativity that the reader once had is now gone because the magical creatures of the odyssey were put into a more human and realistic form the whole purpose of the odyssey is to tell an imaginary tale of the great hero odysseys if homer wanted his novel to be a real life scenario he would have done so himself furthermore the novel doesnt completely translate into a modern day movie some major events that made the novel were nonexistent in the movie for example the multiple events when the gods punished odysseus throughout the epic were not present in the movie in addition the way his son and friends helped him restore his glory was also not a factor in the film in fact in the movie the main character didnt even have a son he had about 7 daughters instead third the whole section of the novel about how odysseys was a war hero and how he fought in troy was not even made reference to in the movie as far as the viewer knows everett is an ordinary guy and thus he is not an outstanding war hero like odysseus was in his prime lastly although the makers of the movie did their best to translate the novel into a modern day film there were just too many things in the novel that could never be placed in the movie the reality is if you cant capture the true ideas of the novel that resulted in its fame today dont turn it into a movie,black_comedy
the coen brothers were very successful in translating the epic poem the odyssey into a modern day movie while adding many changes they were still able to keep many important plot points for example both had a man who wanted to get home to stop someone from marrying his wife also both had a cyclops who somehow was able to hurt the protagonist the coen brothers were able to use these details to portray odysseus as a escaped convict of the 1930s as well as using similar pieces of the plot the coen brothers showed small details that were similarities to homers epic for example odysseus wife was named penelope ulysses wife was named penny even the name ulysses is similar to odysseus when adding these small details to the plot points you realize that the movie a perfect interpretation of the greek poem the odyssey,black_comedy
i was extremely hesitant to watch this movie when i learned it centered around a trio of chainmates 1 of whom escapes to go in search of treasure  i guessed id be torn between hoping theyd succeed in their quest and that theyd get recaptured and sent back to the prison farm as it turns out this was my reaction but the film was actually better than i expected the sheriff who chased them annoyed me greatly  i hated it every time its the authorities was bellowed through the megaphone they carried around i found delmars quotes and misunderstanding with everything that happened to be not only amusing but memorable i also appreciated petes being more moral than everett but everett himself i despised he jeers both his mates when they choose to become baptized claiming pete is being as dull as delmar though its hard to believe he really is a gruff wanted convict when george clooneys acting fails and his voice reveals an ok man at ease behind the beard why pete  if he was so badtempered  didnt snap at him to shut up or else beat him is beyond me im also curious as to how everett managed to get the heat taken off himself with simplistic sentences the average person couldve responded to in a flash having stolen from petes cousin everett reminds him that wash betrayed them to which pete obviously responds with a reminder that this was before any of them had known this  to which everett replies only a fool tries to find logic in the human heart i loathed him for getting away with that the slimeball the one soft spot he has is for the family he hopes to reunite with again i was torn at whether to applaud his wife for wanting to leave him since hes a greedy selfish lying atheist or hope that he won her back we later learn that this in fact the reason he broke free not for a treasure he made up  to the disgust of delmar and especially pete who wrestles him another character i hated was the exceedingly rude pappy odaniel  yeah his sons a fool but he treats him like dirt not to mention everybody else i could see stokes had better taste  so i was more than a little surprised to see he belonged to the worlds worst racist group not that i had a better view of odaniel even if he acquitted the soggy bottom boys i had a lot of trouble with how some things in this movie didnt add up delmar is supposed to be a fool an idiot yet some of what he says sounds decent but it sharply contrasts to his imagining pete has transformed into a toad and therell be an available wizard to reverse it we never learn why pete and delmar were imprisoned  with delmars lack of brains what the devil would he do intentionally knowing it led to prison  so my hoping for their escape ran deeper than for the protagonist who has no morals when i watched this i hadnt been told this was a modernized version of the odesy  but it wasnt hard to believe after seeing sirens still this was the only thing that they seemed to have in common without a stretch i know john goodmans character was supposed to represent a cyclopes but it was considerably stupid how he was a rochefortlike character who pretty obviously wasnt a bible salesmanif everett is so smart why didnt he pick up on this  and why did he choose to join teague who was selling bibles or curse gods name if he was an atheist spoilers ahead the climax is terrific and my view of everett did a 180 when i saw him praying to survive if only to return to his family admitting openly his turning away from god now my hatred was merely focused on the nemesis sheriff who refused to acknowledge his pardon however after the excitements over and his companions note how his prayer mustve been linked to the following event he is instantly back to his atheist attitude showing hes fickle and shallow i hated him once more spoilers end i think this movie was ok but not great the score and soundtrack were ok and the message was good maybe if details made more sense and clooneys acting had been better if thats possible  ive only seen 1 other film of his batman  robin  his acting was better here this wouldve gotten a higher vote from me but its amusing to watch and enjoyable enough,black_comedy
in order not to make anybody angry about the small complaints i have let me say first i love this film i have a copy and i have watched it three timesthis movie was shot in several mississippi towns and i live in one of them my wife jonnie wilson harthcock was in the movie but her scenes were cut and reshot my darling was the first waitress who says yes sir to george clooney in the hotel where they first encounter john goodmans character big dan jonnie had alzheimers i tried to impress this upon the casting director but she liked jonnies looks for that small part but my poor dear could not remember not to look down at her feet when she hit her spot by the table so they had to reshoot it with somebody elsejohn goodman lied to me outside how did he lie to me he was a nice guyknew i was jonnies husbandhe said she did great really she did great she did not do great but john goodman was very nice for no particular reason why was he even in this movie i ask myselfso briefly and inconsequentiallyprobably has or had a contract with the coensfor mississippians theres a lot of funny stuff that nobody else would get for instance all the towns the characters mention are real towns but very jumbled up many scenes were shot in my town of yazoo city but they called it itta bena which is an actual small town up in the delta but not as scenic as yazoo the woolworths that clooney gets thrown out of is the old saxon hardware now a trendy artsy furniture redo place did you noticethe guy who throws clooney out calls it woolsworth of course there never was a woolworths there but the people who own the building left the signs up until they wore outi am a big fan of the coen bros to begin with so dont think i love this film just because they shot it in my town and my wife was supposed to be in it its extremely funny and welldone the three principals do a great job of lipsyncing some terrific music and tim blake nelson is beyond hilarioushere are my small complaintsfirst parchman farm which is way up in the delta nowhere near here never had chain gangs busting rocks we dont have any rocks around here and especially not up at parchman and why would they be busting them and on a dirt road and why were the prisoners all totally out of rhythm with the musicsecond where did the guys get gophers to eat we dont have any gophersthats a western rodent i think the coens chose gophers because what they boys could have caught and eaten  squirrels or rabbits  are too cute and popular for movie fans to see spitted roasted and eaten in a comedy lets just say gophers nobody likes gophersthird we dont have horned toads in mississippi those are western toads and the socalled toad that the fellows thought that turturros character was turned into by the siren was not even a toad it was a frogand finally the film showed a lack of knowledge of mississippi dancing music and dialog of that era bluegrass is not mississippi music for instance it is kentucky music most of the accents were fictitious generic southern not mississippi at all and the dancing was just slapstickstill a very entertaining movie at opinionsoupcom we love it,black_comedy
the coen brothers are weirdif you take this as a known going into the movie it will certainly help you know what to expect that is expect the unexpecteda tale about three escaped convicts who are racing against time to get to a treasure on the way they encounter all sorts of colourful characters and do all sorts of interesting things it is loosely based on the odyssey but since ive never actually read the odyssey it would be difficult for me to draw parallelsparodies of everyone from robert johnson to the carter family show up at some point there are hillbilly rednecks a political election a blind prophet religious fanatics some hooded kkk members and a bunch of pyromaniacs with a penchant for killingsomehow in this hodgepodge a plot and i use the term loosely gets strung together however this movie isnt about the plot nor is it about the acting even despite george clooneys golden globe award each time his accent slipped i questioned how well he deserved that one but none of that was the point the bottom line is this movie is very very funnyof course being able to pick out some of the references helps i admit that i probably missed most of them since many were very obscure but there was still enough humour in there to entertain almost anyonejust dont go into the movie expecting something typical because anything but,black_comedy
what we have hereis a charming fictional story with a much more wholesome period in american history as its backdropthough i personally was not around in the 1930sits clear that the coen brothers remained as true to the depression era south as they possibly couldalso worthy of note is the films soundtrackthe music is beautifully placed in the filmand is such a prominent part of the overall film that it can almost be considered an additional cast member it contains songs that came from the heart of the songwritersrather than board rooms filled with greedy record executivesvery enriching the cast was excellentwith nearly flawless performances across the boardthe only trouble with the film in my view is the depiction of cruelty to animalswhich i am always againstsetting that asidei have no doubt that this will be regarded as one the great films of the new century,black_comedy
what a stylish and fun movie this was the movie was different than what i expected i expected a weird movie with a typical style similar to maybe a tim burton movie the movie however had a very easy to watch style which makes this movie very accessible to watch for all peoplethe story is filled with some wonderful and comical situations and not so likely charactersthe cast does a very good job although in my opinion george clooney was at times overacting a little holly hunter is always a pleasure to watch and i really loved her in this movie two fun small unforgettable parts are played john goodman and michael badalucco i also enjoyed seeing wayne duvall in this movie i never really liked him as an actor in his role in the district but he really impressed me in this moviea very fun and stylish easy to watch movie810httpbobafett1138blogspotcom,black_comedy
yeah thats the feeling i had all along this movie this is the third movie after the man who was not there and the big lebowski by coen brothers that i watched and i liked it immensely actually i didnt quite enjoy the much talked about big lebowski though many of my friends have said that lebowski grows on one after repeated viewings i just felt that it was not of my taste but was i overwhelmed with o brotherinteresting this is the first movie of george clooney that i ever watched and i liked his acting its a very hilarious and yet satirical movie and a clean comedy all the members of a family of any country could sit together and enjoy this movie irrespective of the society they belong to unless of course theyre fanaticswhat else do i have to say,black_comedy
a very different kind of film ulysses george clooney and two coconspirators manage to free themselves from a chain gang record a record meet exotic women battle a oneeyed klansmen meet up with lost loved ones win an election and nearly drown all set in the deep south during the depression and all surrounded by some terrific folk musici thought this movie was a lot of fun the plot is goofy the characters are goofier the situations are quite ridiculous but thats the point its the coen brothers only they could take one of homers epic poems set it in 1930s alabama and throw in a jug band for good measure9 out of 10 sometimes the goofiness can be distracting but it really is a lot of fun,black_comedy
this movie is definitely fun and worth seeingi for one would like to watch it againand its nice seeing george clooney in a role more interesting than that which he plays played on er john turturro another talented actor also does a great jobhowever i bought the soundtrack of this movie first and as a result had certain expectations built up around it the music is beautiful and actually plays a rather large part in the movie so if you have no interest in bluegrassfolk or such similar stuff you probably wont enjoy o brotherim not sure of course but thats sort of the impression ive gotten,black_comedy
i wasnt gonna bother commenting until i saw the amount of negative reviews i feel compelled now to pay my respect to o brother where art thousure when i first heard that it was going to be the odyssey retold in 30s mississippi i scoffed a little thinking that sounded so contrived after watching sullivans travels and lady eve i had developed a deep appreciation for preston sturges films mainly the witty dialogue between people and physical comedy i though maybe this o brother  film was a nod but also a ridingonthecoattailsofhollwoodclassics type of inside jokewho knows how the idea got started but the end result is a fantastic moviei have to tell you a secret lean closer ready whisperi never read the odyssey i was sick at home with mono that spring and was exempt from it but im glad in a way because i got to watch o brother where art thou without even the slightest twinge of recollection of another story i took the story as it went as one should do when trying to get the most out of the film like others said its not like the similarities are glaringly obvious for example spoiler the part with the sirens you can hear sirens vaguely in the backgroundfinally why wouldnt anyone not like a film that enhances their musical education the soundtrack to this is one of the best ever i already knew emmylou harris but i was introduced to alison krauss gillian welsh and jon hartford after seeing thisand the comic timing is understated but perfect its not underestimating the intelligence of the audience with cheap humour the jokes instead are mostly laced in with wordplay and irony who else could get away with the kkk dancing and singing the blues the coen brothers are awesome and this is a classic,black_comedy
i highly recommend this movie this movie may be somewhat overrated by nowif you didnt like it you may have been expecting too much by the time you saw it i think its best to see a movie before the hype this happened with the movie the full monty a lot of people saw it after all the media attention and then wondered what all the fuss was abouti agree with other imdb comments that tim blake nelson is a standout though george clooney does a great job the soundtrack with its bluegrass flavor is fabulous too the movie has a fairly simple plot about the trials and tribulations of 3 convicts who escape a chain gang although theyre minor criminals theyre very likable and you find yourself routing for their freedom and happiness some characters could have had bigger parts such as holly hunters role i liked the symbolism employed in the movie especially the reference to the wizard of oz in the kkk scene the 3 convicts attack 3 clan members and steal their outfits to sneak into to a ceremony and save a friend of theirs just like the lion tin man and scarecrow did to 3 guardsmen when they broke into the castle to save dorthy the ending scene is fantastic and not at all expected overall see this film and enjoy the interesting characters,black_comedy
i must admit i had somewhat of a bias against this movie at the start the style of the movie seemed to conflict with my opinion on a good movie however once i actually decided finally to watch it i realized how wrong i was a very clever comedy very nicely acted and with a certain flavour to it which is rare in movies these days clooneys performance as the fasttalking knowitall with his explanations for every event in the movie make me laugh every time the ending is a little weak ending a little too abruptly for my tastes im the type of person who likes to see a movie ended a little more thoroughly of course that doesnt mean going over the top see wonder boysworth watching dont miss out910,black_comedy
the homeric parallels are very thin very overhyped and dont go much further than calling the main guy ulysses and his wife penny the real penelope didnt get engaged to anyone else while odysseus was away she knew he would come back and wanted him to come back the film is more a picaresque tale in the didactic style of voltairelook say the coen brothers here is this aspect of the depression here is another here are baptists here is a rough gubernatorial campaign here an early radio station here a bent bible salesman here the kkk see how wittily we touch on each and make it quaint by stringing them along our loose little tale of convicts looking for treasure using very old and rather wonderful songs that we didnt write but which are well out of copyright so we didnt have to pay for them,black_comedy
the coen brothers team is one of the best storytellers in the movie business to date i loved the hudsucker proxy and another movie from that type george clooney whom i have disliked ever since his hambone batman portrayal in batman and robin redeems himself here as the fasttalking hero his sidekicks john turturro and tim blake nelson are also very good i love delmar nelson and petes turturro exchange in the movie theater also the scene with the cows is hysterical the best scene however is the scene where the trio discovers a klu klux klan meeting the scene is an obscure wizard of oz reference all in all this movies a little weird but a whole lot of fun check it out,black_comedy
ive seen this movie five times and laugh out loud every time i view it the three stooges who can sing well sorta perfectly cast throughoutclooney rollicking rocks if there was ever a movie thats about onehalf bubble off plumb this is it i think even homer would appreciate the incredible offtake of his odyssey as we follow our heroes through the south ducking divorce syreens the kkk the hangman and divorce a perfect entre into oldtimy bluegrass music the soundtrack is incredible o brother ranks right up there with the princess bride and dr strangelove  sheer craziness bundled in musical celluloid three cheers for cohen eccentricity,black_comedy
are you familiar with kurt vonneguts idea of a karassthat there are something like 12 teams of humans  each team has its own games its own sense of humor its own sense of style etiquette tactics and techniques of persuasion  karasses crosscut all other memberships so that you might not share politics or historical era with your teammates but if you are attuned to the universe you recognize your own karassmatesthe coen brothers  and all who love them are on my karassi hope im spelling karass right  its been 30 years since i read the book but i still think of it almost daily,black_comedy
this movie an adaptation of homers odyssey not just a series of nonsequitor events  john goodman is the cyclops women in the lake are the sirens etc etc is very much worth the time it takes to watch not only is the writing great but visually this movie is stunning its the first or one of the first movie to be completely recolored digitally or something like that and the music amazing im no bluegrass fan myself but when i heard it i fell in love with the catchy gospel songs that characterized this time periodgeorge clooney does a good job carrying the movie but it is the supporting cast that must be congratulated for making this movie as good as it was tim blake nelson and john turturro flesh out the triumvirate and play off each other magnificently the rest of the characters are just as vibranti highly recommend this movie for anyone who 1 loves the 30s 2 loves the coen brothers this movie is more along the silly lines of raising arizona rather than barton fink or blood simple or 3 just wants to see a good movie,black_comedy
while i like many of the coen brothers films there are quite a number that i dont care for  o brother ranks near the top for me and is one of my all time favorites although i really did not appreciate it the first time through  i think some of the comments regarding the plot lapses are valid but for me they are beside the point  this film is one incredible series of set pieces with three terrific characters at their center  clooney turturro and nelson  each one does a great job with their character  once youve seen the film at least two times you can jump in at any point and just enjoy scene after scene  if you rate a movie by the number of lines you can remember from it this is one of the all time greats  much has been said of the soundtrack  i am not a fan of gospel and old timey music but it just works so well here  the theme that holds the film together is everyone is searching for answers and guess what you usually dont find them    my advice is to get acquainted with the characters and enjoy each scene as it comes along  you can get many hours of enjoyment out of this movie 9 out of 10,black_comedy
chain gang prisoners george clooney tim blake nelson and john turturro escape and proceed to georges old home because he says hes got gold hidden there from when he knocked over an armored car which is why he was sent to jail in the first place along the way they encounter a blind black rail road man with no name and a prophecy about their future a back stabbing relative of johns a crazy gun toting thug by name of george baby face nelson three hot sirens who get the boys drunk and haul john off to be tortured by the guys who are chasing them in return for george  tims whereabouts a cyclops played by john goodman and they even become known for a hit country song under the band name the soggy bottom boys we also find out that georges wife is about to get married to another man and that she told their daughters that george died when he got hit by a train and the guy shes marrying is campaign manager to an ambitious racist politician whos also the member of the ku klux klan kkk then george reveals that there is no gold and there was no armored truck i got sent up for practicing law without a license says george he lied to them about the gold because he needed their help to escape because he wanted to get back to his wife and children and now must thwart the man trying to steal his family away from him after rescuing their black guitar player tommy from the kkk they show up at a campaign show and play their song man of constant sorrow and accidentally expose the ambitious politician as a klansman this earns them the gratitude of the towns current mayor and he pardons them of all previous crimes then george takes the boys to his old home because his wife wont patch things up with him until he finds their old wedding rings but there they are found by the chain gang cops one of them a man constantly wearing sunglasses and they overlook what the mayor said about them and try to hang them but after praying to god for a miracle george and the gang are saved by the valley being flooded they even see a cow on top of a farm roofallegedly based on the odyssey by homerpersonally i dont think the coen are all that funny critics are always raving about what masters they are of screwball comedy but personally i see nothing screwy in their comedy this film however is reasonably entertaining and gives george clooney a better outlet for his dry deadpan humor the best line without doubt they loved him up and turned him into a horny toad,black_comedy
i almost dont know where to start with the accolades for this film i certainly think roger ebert has to revisit his 2 12 star rating as i give it a 10 and im not easy to pleaseits a joy from beginning to enda celebration of life  the wonder that is man  to combine many elements of homers odyssey with great music into the rich fabric of the 1930s depression and wrap it all around such interesting characters is a true leap of imagination every character is interesting not just the 3 leads  who else but the cohen brothers would have ever thought of itlike the movie groundhog day this can be watched over  over getting better each time as the insights and awareness of subtle shading and deeper meaning sink in  i especially recommend reading all the external reviews all 700 user comments the number of which indicate the chord this has struck with people and the trivia link at this site  these will add greatly to the understanding and appreciation of this fine film its rare to have a movie which is so entertaining in its own right but which also has such deep meaningthis movie has legs  staying power  will only grow in stature over time i predict well be talking about it watching it and learning from it for decades to comeron,black_comedy
as many others have noted this is a completely original and fresh version of a classical story didnt it wash over you the first time you watched it from the chain gang song to the outlandish reactions of the characters it was mesmerizingwhat always grabs me while watching this movie is the rank hickness of the characters from the stars facial convulsions nelsons expression while watching the frog emerge is delightful to the displayed innocence of the crowds everything shouts inbredwere we as a people really that goofy in those days ive seen photos from that era which also show many blank stares and drooping jaws the coen bros captured the  at least  perceived spirit of the times and shot electric into these timeshow many stars can i give how about all ten,black_comedy
ive read through a number of comments about this movie  the positive reviews often come with intellectual qualifications and the negative reviews fall into a variety of categories most often calling the movie dumb or dull  i suspect the negative reviewers are neither smart nor lively themselvesfor me the simple reality is this movie makes me smile  every scene every line  ive seen it half a dozen times and each time its an effort to tear my eyes away from the screen  i could follow intellectual digressions into what holds my attention but that would steal something from the experiencewatch this film and enjoy it  its worth your attention,black_comedy
sometimes coen brothers movies can come off as overly mannered  sometimes that ruins the film other times you get o brother where art thou  this movie does not exist in any kind of reality the characters talk move and think in a way that has no connection with how humans talk move and think and yet this movie works almost completelyperhaps its the strange mixture of mythic and human perhaps its the dialouge perhaps its the way the coen brothers focus on absurdities of behavior and make them the key to the characters  or perhaps the movie works because it is the funniest of the coen brothers movies  the whole movie is shot in a sepia wash that makes the movie feel old perhaps the style of the acting in the movie represents a time when the whole cinematic world was bitoned  or perhaps its that oldtimey musicwhatever  the plot of the movie loosely follows the odyssey with a few obvious nods to the wizard of oz thrown in  the kkk klose order drill team was outrageous  clooney turturro and nelson play three convicts escaping from a prison chain gang  and apparently the devil as well  along the way they meet the cyclops turn into toads are seduced by sirens become oldtimey singing stars are nearly hung are nearly drowned and eat roast gopher  gopher everett has become one of my favorite lines in recent movies the way nelson says it repeatedly and the look of that poor gopher on a stick  in the end they find a treasure even if it is not the treasure they seekas i mentioned the performances are incredibly unnatural and mannered so it is hard to judge them by regular standards  still clooney turturro and nelson  especially nelson  all pull off their characters admirably  and as always with the coens the direction is interesting  not as good as fargo and blood simple but still quite fine,black_comedy
this is a great movie if you are looking for something that is smart witty and funny o brother is it im not a huge fan of clooney but he is wonderful in this film he will make you laugh all the way through  john goodman john turturro and tim black nelson are perfection the writing and acting is excellent unlike the big lebowski the coen brothers did a wonderful job with this film,black_comedy
this is one of the very rare movies intelligent intellectual wise and witty it has many layers so it can offer food for thought for people of different intellectual abilities one can read it as a complicated book for some it is a story of three men in their pursuit for life for some it is a story of the south for some it is an interpretation of a classic homerian tale for some it is a biblical parable  i praise coen brothers for their hollywood nonconformism wackiness unpredictability intellectualism each movie is a gem in a muggy homogeneous water of standard movies thanks to coen brothers people who are adverse to hollywood ignorance and commercial greed have an incentive to visit movie theater,black_comedy
probably one of my favorites films i love it its about a prisoner called everettplayed by george clooney who has buried a treasure before he went to jail he is chained with two men called petejohn turturro and delmartim blake nelson now they are gonna bust out and dig up the treasure and split it everything takes place in the south during the depression its a wonderful story lined with problems the film is based on homers the odyssey this film is one of many reasons why the coens stays in the business you have to see it you will fall in love with the musicand the sights will stay with you forever and ever its also very very very funny i only have two words see it,black_comedy
this movie really surprised me  who would think of placing a retelling of the odyssey in the south in the 1930s  but the story really works  i was surprised at george clooneys fantastic performance as the fasttalking vain and heartsick jailbreak mastermind  hes not only lovable hes admirable especially because or despite the fact that he accomplishes all the right things in all the wrong ways  holly hunter is also hilarious as his wife penny ive said my piece and counted to threethe soundtrack is very endearing and you fill probably find yourself humming the tunes for days lateroverall i thought this was a very funny movie though perhaps not as good as fargo  but definitely one you will want to see twice if you see it at all,black_comedy
o brother where art thou has it all great vocabulary music parodies and laughter george clooney john turturro john goodman tim blake nelson and holly hunter star in this comedy crime caper about three prisoners going to seek treasure and on the way meet strange people get into perils make people feel better and has a happy ending i love the coen brothers and this is one of their best work ever madeexcellent,black_comedy
i cant imagine many people would sit on the fence with obwat im going to immediately contradict that statement by saying thats where i stand on this movie im a great lover of the coan brothers movies but this film doesnt really do it for me the story follows 3 convicts escape from hard labour in mississipi the acting and soundtrack are both excellent but the script isnt that compelling 710,black_comedy
i think this films a classic the sets flawless the characters the story well yeah i guess that part is already a classic and the music make this one of the alltime bestflawless performances by all you cant help but love it while i just didnt get fargo with this movie the coen brothers hit a homerun,black_comedy
after the disaster that was raising arizona the coens worked and worked until they created this  as opposed to paul verhoeven who hasnt changed his method since robocop the coens are an interesting pair  even in their failures except intolerable their work is something to behold  this isnt a failurethe music is the undercurrent of the film not the characters  i frankly dont care for the particular country style i could live without it  but it serves its purpose as supporting the period  weve certainly changed as a society in the last 70 years hallelujahthe coens have the story structured wonderfully  i thought a nonlinear timeline would work great for this story until i watched it again and realized that it is a nonlinear odyssey  heck its better than the odysseywhat i really like is clooney  his character is a mix of his three kings major with ferris bueller  instead of obviously winking at the audience he does it unconsciously  thats a tougher skill to master and he pulls it off really good  can hanks do the same for ladykillersfinal analysis   learn from this,black_comedy
this is a hilarious adventure of a trio of guys after they broke out of prisonthis story takes place in the south during the depressionthe story was excellent and the acting was supurbif you need a laugh check this one out  youll be glad you did ,black_comedy
i found oh brother where art thou to be great it was really funny and really showed the odyssey in it it had many of the characters from it like the sirens the cyclops and the lotus eater there are also great quotes and the people are extremely humerous you will not stop laughing one of my favorite quotes was they loved him up and turned him into a horney toad this was when pete disappeared from my opinion this is a great movie,black_comedy
i found the movie to be very funny and entertainingthe music was good and the characters were excellenti wish more movies were made like thatgood family viewingi loved everyone in the movieespecially george clooneyi must have watched it four times,black_comedy
i couldnt believe my eyes when i saw negative reviews of this classic film an amazing period piece its hilarious the cast is superb the cinamatography is great it keeps you interested from start to finish definitely on the top of this movie buffs list of fine work,black_comedy
o brother is a delightful movie quirky and filled with laughs the laughs dont come in rushes but in a steady stream of wordplay and bizarre situations i thought it was soso the first time i saw it but after a second viewing i was hooked i had a similar experience with the coen brothers the big lebowski repeat viewing adds to the pleasure because their films tend to have many layers the music is wonderful toopartial proof being the album sold over 36 million copies,black_comedy
i very rarely have any wish to watch a film where country music dominates it so it was with an almost bored and disinterested mood i settled down to watch this with my wife within five minutes my position had changed george clooney is a revelation and i started laughing as soon as he was dragged from the boxcar by his prison chains i also found it evocative and moving as the trio of the hapless wandered through the bible belt in the time of the great depression i really cant say the film had a leading actor because the three protagonists were equally excellent i loved the music and i have to say i bought the cd for the sheer pleasure of hearing man of constant sorrow and jail house now the story oscillates from the comic to the ridiculous and on to the moving seamlessly and how on earth it flopped in the cinema is a mysteryi believe this will be a cult movie in years to come and will be a defining moment in the career of george clooney,black_comedy
o brother where art thous title is reason enough to like this film it is amazingly well done one of the coens best and the whole tone of the film  from the music to the shade of screen  is so dreamlike and creative that its hard not to like it  its funny smart sad tense tragic dreamy and cool all in onethe story focuses on the adventures of three escaped convicts george clooney john turturro and tim blake nelson on their way to find treasure in depressionera south usa  on their way they meet loads of colorful characters and even have a runin with the klu klex klanand worsei have to say the most remarkable thing about this movie is clooneys performance  i didnt think the guy had it in him but he manages to pull his accented and bumblingly intelligent character well  this definitely ranks up with oceans eleven and out of sight for movies showing that yes george can actthe coens screenplay is also worth mentioning  ever since millers crossing youd expect a coen movie to be filled with much smart witty and entertaining dialogue  you get what you expect  witty is an understatement for every word that exits every characters mouthfor those of you looking for good coen i recommend thisand anything else really 8510,black_comedy
an absolutely hilarious movie  probably the best comedy i have seen so far although many people i talk to hate it  i cant quite put my finger on why  i suppose if you like standard sitcomstyle comedy you wont like itthe beauty of the humour stems from how out of touch everybody is  for example george clooney is a lawyer who escapes from prison and is obsessed with his hair  and the recording engineer never thought of competing with competitionsome of the lines are outrageous i suppose it would be the acme of foolishness to inquire if you have hair net or this store is a geographical anomaly  two weeks from everywheresome parts arent funny or i dont get but the entertaining portions make up for the obscure bitsi also dont like watching the drawnout scene of the two guys getting clobbered repeatedly with the tree branch  it makes me feel like ive been tricked into watching wwfthe other feature worthy of remark is the music  the whole thing is set to folk music  its a great soundtrack  watch the movie in stereo if youre an audiophile,black_comedy
i recently watched the movie oh brother where art thou after my class at school read the book the odyssey  apparently the movie is supposed to be based on the book  while i watched the movie i was kindof confused at first on how this movie could possibly relate to the book but the more i thought about it the storyline was very much the samethe book is about a man named odysseus who fought in the trojan war in troy but on his efforts to get home he encountered many adventures  he met plenty of new people on every island he landed on and he underwent many trials and hardships  in the movie ulysses everett mcgill was a man that escaped his prison sentence so that he could get home to his family and also find the treasure  the movie covered the different adventures that him and his two prison mates went through to get to where they were goingi thought that this movie was good  it was funny and that is always an important element in a good movie  the only theme that i really could pick out from this movie was the one about friends  the three men in this movie stuck together through everything  i think the filmmaker was trying to tell the audience how important it is to have friends  we go through things so much easier with friends than we do by ourselves and i think this movie is a good example of that my favorite thing about this movie was the way that they got the characters to match the kind of life they were living  the story takes place down south and i mean these characters looked and behaved just like old country hicks  the quality of the characters was very well chosen  another thing i really liked was the use of the color in this film  i dont know how they did it but by the way they used that faded coloring it made the movie so much more realistic  it was really believable that the movie couldve been filmed back during the old south due to the usage of color  i also really enjoyed the music in the movie  the music was well chosen it was very southern sounding and it actually matched the character scenes pretty wellthis movie was well made  the storyline flowed pretty accurately throughout the whole movie and it wasnt hard to follow  overall i give this movie a good rating and i think if you are looking for something to give your day a little dry humor this would be the movie to watch,black_comedy
i have always liked george clooney even though he was never my favorite actor it seems that lately hes been involved in many just average movies  o brother where art thou definitely breaks this trendclooney presents himself as a cleancut smoothtalking escapee from a southern chain gang his character ulysses everett mcgill is often getting himself into bad situations but always managing to be able to get out of the tight spot  this was a very hard role for clooney to play because it differs so much from his norm  the movie revolved mainly on mcgill so the success of the film was largely in part to clooneys exceptional job o brother where art thou brings with it a specific time and place  the movie is set in the deep south  mississippi during the 1930s  mcgill is a criminal mastermind who was sent to prison for practicing law without a license  he manages to convince his convince his absentminded chain gang brothers delmar played by tim blake nelson and pete played by john turturro to make a run for it  for their help with escape mcgill will take his brothers to his home to get a hidden treasure that soon will be washed away when a newly built dam will flood the area i have heard many times that the final destination is not always as important as how you get there  this is true for o brother where art thou there are many events that occur while the men are on their way to their destination  the movie somewhat goes along with novel the odyssey but set during the great depression south  as the movie goes on the similarities become more apparent  in the odyssey the main character odysseus is being forced to stay on an island far from his home  this compares to mcgill being in prison  when odysseus finally is aloud to leave the island it is the gods who keep him from making a swift journey home where in o brother where art thou it is the police that inhibit mcgill from completing the journey music plays an important part in the movie as well  music was an extremely important part of the depressionera south and the coen brothers make this very evident as the movie goes on  to make some extra money the three escapees team up with a black hitchhiker to record a catchy tune in a rural radio station  as the song is passed over the airwaves it becomes a instant success and the soggy bottom boys are a hit  in the south at this time it was music that helped people to go on living and take their minds off the hard times to get through them  this is taken to the extreme when the soggy bottom boys are pardoned of their crimes for helping return the current governor of mississippi get reelected when the governor endorses the group it does not surprise me george clooney received the golden globe for best actor for his performance in o brother where art thou  the movie gave a new look to the odyssey being set in depressionera mississippi but not one that completely stayed true to the book but did do a nice job  what really was a hit in o brother where art thou was the music  it connects the viewer in a different kind of way  this film was not one of the better films i have watched but it was entertaining and thats the most important thing,black_comedy
recently i read the odyssey translated by allen mandelbaum for my ap english class  after we read the book we watched o brother where art thou  when my teacher first mentioned that we were going to watch this movie i figured that it would be kind of close to what happened in the odyssey  when the movie began i was very surprised at how different it was  it was set in the 30s and the main characters were prison escapes compared to being set at a time just after the trojan war and having the main character odysseus a hero in the movie there were some similarities to the book but nothing really seemed to come across as a structured similarity  the similarities seemed to be scattered throughout the movie in no particular order  to me the sheriff with the hound dog is the most realistic similarity to me because throughout the whole movie the three men are trying to escape from him just like in the odyssey when odysseus is trying to escape the wrath of poseidon  another similarity that i can see between the book and the movie is the role of baby face  in the movie he is a notorious bank robber that picks up the three men just after he had robbed a bank  he supplies the three men with some of the money that he had stolen and when they go their separate ways is caught by the police  this is similar to the help that the phaeacians gave to odysseus when he landed on their island  they gave him many gifts for him to take home and they also gave him escort to his homeland  but on their way home poseidon punished them for assisting odysseus return one thing that i didnt understand about the movie was the flooding of the river when the three men were about to be hung  i was thinking that it might be similar to the help that odysseus received from athena throughout the book and how if her help wasnt there odysseus wouldve gotten into much more trouble and maybe even had his life taken away  but that event could be interpreted in many different ways overall i think the movie was pretty good but to me comparing the movie to the odyssey makes the movie more confusing and less entertaining  i read the book before the movie and i spent most of the time during the movie trying to figure out who represents who and what stands for what  so i would recommend watching the movie before reading the book just so the movie can be a little more enjoyable,black_comedy
a movie based in 1930s mississippi it follows three convicts  ulysses mcgill pete and delmar  i began watching the movie a few minutes into the beginning so needless to say i was a bit confused that confusion followed me through out the whole movie i knew that it was loosely based on the odyssey but i think that may have gotten me a bit more confused because i was thinking it would be the exact same thing  i was looking for something that wasnt there the three actors were absolutely amazing  it was because of them that i kept interest and even laughed now and then  these guys were probably my favorite part of the movie  i especially enjoyed the part where they thought pete turned into a frog which was symbolic of circe and odysseus men being turned into pigs  it was so funny how they toted him around everywhere thinking that those women turned him into the frog those women were symbolic of homers sirens who tempted the crew with their song  my favorite character because of this would probably have to be delmar delmar and pete just brought an extra special feeling to the whole movie  their accents made them sound like funny southern boys and thats exactly what i believe the filmmakers were trying to portray  with the way they acted and with their dialect they added a little bit more of a comedic performance  george clooney also portrayed his character very well  i especially like the little hair fetish that was added in  that was not something that youd expect from a 1930s mississippi convict but it was a really cute touch besides from those three characters my next favorite part of the movie was the music  this too was absolutely amazing  i enjoyed it so much that i actually went to the library and got a copy of the soundtrack  i loved the sound of it  i really believe that it added to the movie  the sound had a southern country vibe going on and it really helped set the whole setting  the music really enhanced the story that the filmmakers were trying to get across  it just put me in the setting and got me a little bit more interested in fact i enjoyed it so much that i plan on buying that cd pretty soon  my teacher had mentioned that this movie won an award for its soundtrack and i absolutely believe that they deserved it i recommend whoever enjoyed the movie to go out and listen to it like i mentioned earlier the film is loosely based on homers the odyssey  i knew that this was the case before i began watching the movie so i think that i was comparing the two just a little bit too much  the fact that i was doing this didnt give me much of a chance to focus on the unique plot of the movie  there are some things that the two have in common however  for example the three men stop along the trail because they hear a beautiful song  this was the same situation that odysseus and his men came across when they met the sirens another similarity is that both the movie and the book had a cyclops in the movie however the only real reason you could recognize him was because he only had one good eye and cyclops in the book only had one eye as well  of course george clooneys character was supposed to represent odysseus and the whole plot was supposed to resemble that of the books both characters were trying to get home to their wives and families other than that there are not many more similarities  all in all though i would give this movie a seven  maybe if i ever see it again i can pay closer attention to the movies plot and come to appreciate it a little bit more,black_comedy
o brother where art thouo brother where art thou was a movie that paralleled homers epic the odyssey  throughout the movie the display of comradery can easily be seen amongst the main characters a belief shared in the odyssey as wellthe movie was based around three men who escaped from a prison  they are the run from the local police and encounter a blind man slowly traveling down the railroad  they hitch a ride and are enlightened about their futures  this act can be paralleled to tiresias speech the main prediction to odyssey about his futureduring the movie the three main characters not only encounter the local police but also a group of three young singing women  throughout their hypnotic melodies the three escapees fall in a state of total infatuation surprise with the singing muses  the two men wake up later only to find their other partner in crime missing i will not spoil the movie by saying who took him but i think its pretty obvious  the two remaining men go out and begin to search for their missing amigothe singing muses are examples of the sirens that were utilized by homer in the odyssey  the main character odysseus had to survive their incessant songs in order to get home  obviously the women in o brother where art thou are completely different from the sirens in the odyssey but the fundamental idea remains the same o brother where art thou walks handinhand with the odysseyoverall i found the movie to very good  the plot mimicked the odysseys main storyline with a easy progression throughout the film  the actors added a great deal of variety as well,black_comedy
after reading the story the odyssey in my ap english class i was not too excited about watching this movie just because of the the plain fact that i totally disliked the book  but now after seeing the movie all i can say is wow  i really liked how the director decided to bring the story of the odyssey into the 20th century  my favorite character would have to be ulysses everett mcgill played by george clooney  he played the role of odysseus in this journey of 3 convicts on the run from a mississippi prison in the 1930s and their journey to find a lost treasure  the three face many trials and tribulations along the way  from a one eyed bible salesman to 3 beautiful sirens this story has everything you would want in a comic adventure i cant wait to see this movie again so i can enjoy it just as much as i did the first time,black_comedy
o brother where art thou  a modern film based off of a timeless epic the odyssey written by homer  the main character was portrayed by uylesses a smart talking courageous adventurer off in search for a treasure  with his two companions pete and everett  the three broke out of a hard labor prison camp being chased by the police  uylesses pete and everett run off to a farm where everetts cousin betrays them for a bounty  after narrowly escaping the authority they run into a pilgrimage where pete and everett are saved by a preacher  they soon run into three seducing beautiful sirens who turn pete into a frog according to everett  after bing ambushed by a corrupt bibles salesman they find out that the sirens have turned in pete to the police  after busting him out they find out from ulysses that there is no treasure  he apparently wanted to stop his wife from remarrying pete and everett happened to be chained to them  with a suprise ending and a run in with the law the three bad boys end up on top  using creative camera angles and tricks the director was able to bring about on adventerous and exciting film  the director was also able to achieve this effect using sephia colors and creative music brightening the overall audience view and placing them into an open and adventerous mood  my favorite part of the movie was when ulysses pete and everett crash a kkk gathering to rescue their friend from being lynched  on a scale of 1  10 this was an 8,black_comedy
in my ap english class we recently watched the movie o brother where art thou  i was somewhat disappointed with this movie because i had the expectation that it was going to have much more in common with the odyssey as the movie the thirteenth warrior had much in common with the story of beowulf  i do see a small resemblance however and understand now that it was not meant to be identical  some correlations i have made ulysses everett mcgill played by george clooney represents odysseus big tan teauge played by john goodman represents cyclops penny wharvey mcgill played by holly hunter represents penelope i notice in o brother where art thou as in the odyssey the overall main theme is the fact that a man wishes to return to his wife  in this case ulysses is in jail and wants to be sure he gets home to be with his wife and children  i respect his wish to get home but question some of his actions he started out with a lie using his friends just so he would not have to take the journey by himself  he broke out of jail and even used stolen money  ulysses constantly was running from authority and would take on fake appearances  it seems as if he is under the impression that the end justifies the means  i feel this is not the case at all and ulysses realized this when his friends confronted him about his motifs  the end never justifies the means  if you want a positive goal then you should be willing to make sacrifices to get to this goal  it is not right to take advantage of people and have no regard for others feelings when trying to accomplish your goal ulysses did have a fine goal however  he missed his wife and children and wanted to see them and make a life for them  unfortunately even with his goal of providing for his family he took a bad route  ulysses did not want to take sacrifices and work hard to provide money for his family  he chose to take the easy way out and that is how he ended up in jail  this is another good example of how the end does not justify the means  even though ulysses had a noble goal of taking care of his family he went about it the wrong way and got himself into trouble with the law  hopefully he learned his lesson and was only kidding at the end of the story when reunited with his wife he told her that he was getting a fake dentist license to support them from now on,black_comedy
a movie that is based upon the book the odyssey of homer  throughout the entire story people and things with significance pop up in the movie that can be related with gods people and creatures in the book the odyssey of homer  examples of these people would be like ulysses everett mcgill representing odysseus in the movie  the sirens were portrayed as the beautiful women singing on the river bank john goodman played a man by the name big dan teague that portrayed cyclops he wore a white suit and a white patch over one of his eyes  ulysses former wife was portrayed as penelope and her soon to be husband vernon was portrayed as a suitor  the old man who told ulysses and his fellow convicts pete and delmar there future that laid ahead of them could be related to the prophet tiresias in the book the odyssey of homer  most of the challenges that they faced on the way to finding there treasure could be related to those challenges odysseus face in the odyssey of homeran easy movie to understand for the most part but i had the most trouble trying to figure out how big dan teague knew that ulysses pete and delmar had so much money with them they never talked about it in public or anything like that and never had it out on the table where they were eating in the restaurant  how did he know the best part of the movie to me would have to be how the movie related to the odyssey of homer in so many ways  the people portrayed similar characteristics and the same events took place in both  the book was more easier to understand after watching this movie  overall this was a very good movie but there was one thing that i did not like and that being that after the flood and after ulysses pete and delmar emerge from the water and saw the cow on the roof the movie jumps to ulysses and his wife walking there six daughters  how did they get back together  what happened to pete and delmar and what did they end up doing with there life  if you think about it that is how the odyssey of homer also ended with many unanswered questionswhile watching o brother where art thou i found a character that i really liked and one that i did not like so much  it is ironic that they would end up together as well  i grew fond of ulysses because of his great courage and fearlessness  he always found a way to get himself pete and delmar out of tight spots  on the other hand i did not like his wife as much because she lied to her children and told them that there dad had been hit by a train and killed  even when she did see ulysses again she told them never to talk to strangers and that ulysses was not there fatheri found the music in this film to be very interesting and it fit right into the time period this movie was taking place in  the music was from the 1920s and the lyrics even fit into the challenges that ulysses and his two friends had to get through  at the same time the color in the film made it truly look like this movie was filmed in to the 1920s  combining these two things makes a great movie and that is what happened  i even learned a few things about life back in the 1920s from this moviei recommend this movie to anyone whether it be just for enjoyment or if you are trying to find a way to understand the odyssey of homer a little bit more clearer  there is some cursing in it but nothing too bad this movie is worth taking a couple of hours out of your day and watching  i am sure that you will not be disappointed i was not,black_comedy
i read the odyssey  i got the references to that book and the historical stuff like robert johnson  but you see i dont laugh at something just because i get it  the coens seem to hope people will do just that  laugh at semiesoteric references just because you recognize them because you can feel superior to the yokels who arent as well read i guess  but you see without punchlines it just isnt funny  many fairly pointless scenes just sort of peter out without so much as a chuckle beyond the reference comedy theres the same tired old jokes about southern hicks and whatnot yawn  it certainly isnt the worst movie ive seen it shows talent at times and its purty to look at and all but at the end of the day  it just aint funny charming or even all that interesting  but thats just me,black_comedy
the eighth outing from the coen brothers this film is a delight from the very first frame the film is set during the depression in the coens version of the deep south a south that glows with the gold tones of a sepia tinted photograph and features a supporting cast of weird and wonderful characters loosely based on homers odyssey it features george clooney as ulysses everett mcgill a convict who escapes from a chain gang with 2 dimwitted side kicks pete john turturro and delmar tim nelson blake in a bid to stop his exwife from remarrying  along the way they meet a blind oracle a young black geetar player who has sold his soul to the devil a manicdepressive bank robber a trio of seductive sirens an evil oneeyed bible salesman and also manage to influence the race for the governorship of the state of mississippi integrate the races in the deep south and have a hit record as the soggy bottom boysclooney proves to be more than capable of handling himself in the coen comedy universe and gets some of the funniest moments of the film as the hairobsessed everett the image of clooney in a hairnet is one that is not going to go away  everett is a feckless petty crook not nearly as smart as he thinks he is but in the kingdom of the witless the halfwitted man is king  pete and delmar are truly witless dumber than a bag of hammers and much of the films comedy comes from their pratfalling and face pulling  but just as much comes from the wonderful dialogue which in places is so sharp it could cut itselfpappy odaniel thank god your mammy died givin birth if shed a seen ya shed a died of shameeverett well aint this place a geographical oddity two weeks from everywheretommy i had to be at that there crossroads last midnight to sell my soul to the devil everett well aint it a small world spiritually speakin  pete and delmar just been baptised and saved i guess im the only one that remains unaffiliated delmar oh son and for that you traded your everlasting soul tommy well i wasnt usin itthrow in the wonderful gospel and bluegrass soundtrack the tendency of many of the major characters to burst into song the slightly overthetop in a good way acting and the dreamy slightly out of reality quality of the southern setting and the film starts to have the feel of an oldfashioned feelgood musical  this culminates in a rally of the klu klux klan which is choreographed like an mgm musical with marching blocks of knights of the kkk performing an elaborate dance and forming the shape of the cross  like the dance dream sequence at the bowling alley in the big lebowski this is totally unexpected but completely at one with the universe they have created  the plot of the movie is rambling and episodic much like the work on which it is based with characters drifting in and out of the narrative and no big emotional payoff at the end  but that doesnt matter what matters is the journey and its a journey well worth taking where else would you get to see a cow on the roof of a cotton shack or a police van that shoots itself up from the inside out unmissable,black_comedy
the coen brothers always have one or two other characters in a film beside those listed in the credits  in raising arizona millers crossing blood simple and obwat it was the patterns of speech we call accentswhats the rumpus was a common question in millers crossing along with other quick witted period dialogin fargo it was that minnesota slang ehin o brother where art thou a story based on homers odessey the look of the film was also a character right along with the dialog and speech patternsevery square inch of the movie was digitally enhanced a first in the industry to give the countryside a dried out dusty lookit was also damned funny in a very tongue in cheek way  this is what i love about the fun films they make  they poke fun but in a decidedly nice way and if you get the joke its a private shared joke  and inside joke as it werethe characters were a riot  ulysses everett mcgill the manically talkative conman pete the dark and forbidding language mangler and delmar odonnell the sweet clueless bumpkinperhaps this wasnt the best coen brothers movie ever but for sheer entertainment value it beat just about every other movie that came out that year  loved the soggy bottom boys,black_comedy
though the story is not all that special  we have seen numerous stories of convicts on the run  this film is ultimately attractive for a number of different reasons the interpretations displayed by the three runaways is always acceptable or better the photography is excellent and a few songs from country and negro spirituals add finetasting ingredients to the proceedings together with some handsome cars from the 1930s the whole is an entertaining result  as long as you are not looking for anything too deep philosophical or otherwise intellectual thus religious references  including the ku klux klan  should not be taken seriously indeed that is part of the point the coen brothers  jewish in origin  wanted to make being neutral or nonbeliever often allows you to open your eyes to other points of view and not be critical of those who profess other religions which is perhaps the best religion of all i cannot think of any other film at this moment in which george clooney as ulysses communicated to me better than in this film  or even john turturro come to think of it the three escaped convicts played really likeable characters which overode any shallowness the storyline might have had whether the original odyssey by homer really has much to do with this film is up to you obviously it is with no disrespect nor by fortuitous accident that the rotund politician went by the name of homer as well as the evident connection with the use of ulysses however all that mississippi countryside was filmed lovingly with exquisite care playing with the sunlighti certainly found this film more attractively entertaining than the other famous film by the coen brothers the big lebowsky and is worth the high side of 6 on my scale,black_comedy
if you had been educated by as good a teacher as we have youd understand that these creative films that you rudely put in inverted commas are the work of individuals who despite the pressures of the industry are able to express and share their own visions with the world as a film student i and my good class mates felt the need to try and open your narrow mind now you may not be able to appreciate this or even why anyone would want to but it is a great ability to analyse a film and make interpretations and connections as it enables us to expand our knowledge and enjoy films on a more intellectual level this also allows us to view film as an art form perhaps one of the most influential aspects of life bringing alive our sensibilities making us more human the coen brothers may not appeal to you and yes their so called wierdness may put you off but surrealism is also a key feature of the coen brothers films try barton finkthe coen brothers deserve your upmost respect for being brave enough to share their vision with the world knowing perfectly well that thered be narrowminded people out there ready to criticise at every avaialable point i urge you to reconsider to open your mind to these creative films and allow these films to transport you to alternative worlds where perhaps you may find a little wierdness nicola agrees,black_comedy
my rating  out of  i consider myself a cohen brothers fan i loved both fargo and raising arizona but i was disappointed with this movie i found it to be quite dull the acting was ok george clooney was miscast though in my opinion the other two fugitives were good though holly hunter was fine john goodman was good as he is in most of the cohen brothers moviesthe writing is fine it has some good lines but its flat compared to the likes of fargo the direction is fine what really shines is the beautiful cinematography thats one nomination the movie did deserve,black_comedy
o brother where art thou wasnt that funny  it had a couple very funny parts but only a couple  i dont even know if it should have been considered a comedy  it kind of had a not very exiting plot  i mean it was pretty exiting at some parts but the whole plot was kind of boring  its not really worth the money if your going to rent it at blockbuster or something12 out of ,black_comedy
there are things going on in obwat that i rarely see commented on and i feel compelled to comment on  i loved this movie  arcana include  a high shot of the car with the three leads passing a crossroad where a man is hitchhiking  they stop and pick up tommy johnson who claims to have met the devil  this is clearly robert johnson the great blues singer whom legend claims went to the crossroad and made a deal with the devil  the governor trying to get elected by singing is historically governor jimmy davis who wrote you are my sunshine  in the odysseyodysseus men were turned into swine  this is much to much of a special effect for the coen brothers so they had the sirens seemingly turned one of the crew into a frog  the scene in the movie where the convicts are taken into a theater is clearly an homage to preston sturges sullivans travels where the convicts are shown a cartoon and the only bright spot in their dreary lives is the laughter that comes from the mickey mouse cartoon  odysseus blinds the cyclops with a flaming stick and in the movie the oneeyed kkk monster is killed with a flaming stake to the eye  all in all rich and enjoyable buck white and his daughters do an excellent job with the carter family songs ps as a bluegrass guitar playeri loved the music,black_comedy
you must read the odyssey before you are going to understand that this film is based on that story i can see how someone with no clue about the homerian epic usually required reading in high school would find this film tedious or not understandable at times for me this film was perfect and george clooney shines with a supporting cast that performed superbly the music is wonderful as wellalso check out raising arizona the big lebowsky and fargo by the brothers cohen excellent films allfyi the odyssey is available for free all over the web check it out,black_comedy
although there were some funny parts in this movie it definitely isnt worth wasting the time and money to watch  its difficult to understand both the deep southern dialect and the storyline  there are way too many things happening in the storyline which makes it very difficult to understand  half the time i didnt even know what was going on  it also drags on and on  i give it a twooutoften rating since the actors tried,black_comedy
quite possibly the dumbest movie ive ever seen and ive seen some dumb ones i mean it has its funny moments like all films but overall it was creepy stupid and dumb the plotline was very weak and it dragged for quite a while i think george clooney is a cool guy but i hated his character i give o brother 2 out of 10 stars i would have given it 0 stars but it was very mildly funny,black_comedy
i read on the trivia page that the coen brothers hadnt read theodyssey before working on o brother where are thou and i reallybelieve that  if they had this could have been a really smart movieas it is it vaguely refers to parts of the odyssey without muchthought being put  the few scenes that are inspired by theodyssey are clustered together and late in appearing i got thesirens part but why mix that with circe  why does the kkkmeeting represent hades hades in not hell and is not limited tobad people  what the heck is cyclops doing there anywaythese elements are too randomly included for the movie to bebased on the odysseyone huge difference between o brother and the odyssey is thecharacter of odysseus he wasnt a thief he was a king  hetraveled 10 years to reach his home and lost all his men on theway  his outer beauty reflected his nobility and wit  in a word hewas perfect  although clooneys character is a smartass hes notexactly smart  penelope is of course the other great character inthe odyssey where she patiently waits for odysseuss returnwho  upon his return kills all the suitors who abused thehospitality they were offered  o brother also forgets telemachustheir son if this movie intended to transpose scenes from the odyssey ontothe rural american south it could have done so in many differentways but i guess reading homer should have been the first stepmagic could have been out of it theni failed to find this movie hilarious but i did find the photographybeautiful as well as the incorporation of music  i am not veryfamiliar with the coens films i only saw fargo and that was 2weeks ago but they seems stuck on idiocy and i have a hard timeappreciating that  another thing they seem to do is open with ageneral appeal in o brother the opening lines of the odysseyappear and in fargo we are told that the following story is truewhich isnt because theres a disclaimer with the end credits  imnot sure what the point of these openings is since theyre bothdeceptive overall this movie could have been full of genius with smarthumor and wonderful references but i guess it falls short ofachieving that  the end result is a little weak or not as good as itought to be,black_comedy
never saw such a boring and stupid over rated movie a complete lost of time and money to watch it for me it is totally incomprehensible that it is so high rated poor story poor everything,black_comedy
first off what was the big trip with the soundtrack next what was the big deal with this pointless film it was merely a succession of unbelievable acts thrown together so a man could get back his useless wife who only wanted a man who had his bonafides in place it had a few interesting moments but far more droll,black_comedy
ive tried and ive tried  after reading imdb reviews im sure im about the only person alive who just well    doesnt get it  raising arizona was ok but the big lebowski and o brother were almost painful to watch  and ive searched for fargo in every video store and am yet to find it  if its such a classic why dont the video stores carry ito brother took all my patience and concentration just to understand the accents  maybe thats part to blame on me being australian and not getting southern american accents  the storyline seemed to change every few moments i didnt give a rats arse about the characters and where were the jokes  i picked this up in the comedy sectionthe pace of o brother was incredibly slow excrutiatingly slow and soooo long  i walked out for half hour came back and felt like i didnt miss anythingunless youre a fan of the coen brothers id stay away from this film unless you enjoy mindnumbing entertainment,black_comedy
a good interesting script good direction and photography and excellent score its an all round watch and watchagainable filmfor me though clooney did not pull off the central role and i felt the film suffered as a result there was too much of standard clooney showing in the character there always seems to be in all of his films everyone else in the film especially his two partners did a fine if not outstanding job but i felt the film could have really shone if the central character had been more in characterit may depend wholly on what you think of clooney as an actor as to how you compare the film with fargo and lebowski i felt he was the weak link but your mileage may varyat any rate he does not ruin the film and you could hardly go wrong by renting or buying it i would not judge other cohen bros films by this one howevermixed feelings,black_comedy
well in my humble opinion terrible movie no direction humor was lame george clooked very dapper though john g is a mean guy in this movie and i am not used to seeing him be so cruel,black_comedy
the coen brothers have definitely made better movies than o brother where art thou but it by no means means that this movie is not good the movie is presented very lightheartedly and the story is a bit exaggerating however it is this which makes this movie an interesting farce jokes flood every part of the film and even though the story itself makes little sense it gives us a great shot of fun at least in fact i kept laughing all the time while watching if you are expecting great acting clooney tuturro and nelson wont disappoint you indeed they form a golden triangle much stronger than that in three kings all in all the film is fairly good and undoubtedly one of the best in 2000,black_comedy
while it may not be the most profound movie ever made o brother exudes a cheerful uncomplicated spirit that no other film can match  apart from introducing a great deal of beautiful music the coen brothers have managed to tell a pleasant whimsical and ultimately touching story which is no less than perfect after its own fashion  if you want a movie that makes you think and feel deeply than it might be better to give this one a miss but if you simply want to smile and laugh and feel better about the world o brother where art thou fits the bill,black_comedy
ill say right awayi like the coen brothers i find them to be truly originals they try to show that there are more to films than cliches and in every film they show that what concern the technicality they are superb and this is no difference technically speaking they are superb however it seems that in this film they some how neglected the story the basis for the story is homers odyssey but you wont miss anything if you have never read it because its the characters from the odyssey that the film is full with and nothing morefurther more the films is full with characters who come in to the film and disappear after a few minutes only to reappear in a later stagewith no explanations to their motives or a better insight to their characterswhich were one dimension i also had  a feeling that the whole story was formed as a meaning to serve for the music numbers and that made the film a little bit pointless though i like music and musicals i found it here to be ill serving the moviebut in a strange way i rather enjoyed the film and i wasnt bored from it and in order to enjoy this film you have to be a real fan of the coen brothers,black_comedy
i can see why this film causes such a variety of reviews as an interpretaion of the odyssey it helps to have read the story it really is not an interpretaion so much as a loose following events are based on the epic poem there are numerous factual errors and mistakes that have to be intenitonal the music is an aquired taste but it helps develope the overal tone of the piece living in the south most of the jokes are very funny but i am not sure how some of them carry across the nationworld as a piece of light entertainment it was decent as an interpretation of a classic work it stunk,black_comedy
the coen brothers them being joel and ethan have a pretty good film here recommendable to say the least if its not one of their very best it might be because it goes for so much within the framework of the odyssey that it threatens to run off the tracks but theres a great deal of originality here too from the kkk musical number to the tommygunned cows to the hornytoad mystery following the sirens to a great final hoedown involving men with fake beards its crazy and it works most of the time its an odyssey inspired by homer though it isnt exactly based on it from what i described up above its really a jumping off point as if the brothers took what they remembered from the story after reading it in school and then put on their own ideas for the characters based on who could best play them the film takes place in 1930s mississippi where 3 convicts tim blake nelson john tuturro and in a clark gablelike face george clooney escape to go look for a hidden treasure but like in the original homer odyssey there are their sidetracks sirens and villains john goodman does a good job as this villain about the 4th best coen brothers movie you can find with some enjoyable comedy and some ironic moments definitely fun and with some memorable tunes a,black_comedy
i saw this one a couple of weeks after the grammy awards ceremony in which the o brother soundtrack won for best album  consequently i was painfully aware of the horrific bluegrass music constantly being shoved down my throat throughout the entire length of this borefest  if they had classified this as a musical i wouldnt have been so offended unfortunately no other kind of music can hide the rotting flesh of a film that hides beneath all that awful noise  the stereotypes are cartoonish at best with all the southerners coming across as a huge collection of evil retarded trolls  im trying to remember did i laugh out loud at any point during this snoozer  oh yes i seem to recall myself chuckling at the first reference to hornytoads midway through the story but the next 70 billion references to them hardly inspired glee  clooney and turturro are mildly engaging but holly hunter is a complete waste of a genuine southern accent  the plot is meandering pointless and ultimately boring  what you say the plot is based on homers odyssey  ooh how intellectual save your money for the buddy holly story if you want to hear good southern music,black_comedy
i was dragged along to this movie and figured i would be disappointed at wasting two hours of my life not having liked other films thati was in fact proven incorrect this movie is brilliant the script is funny but also endearing the casting is superb the music is wonderful all in all its an fantastic film definitely worth watching again and again definitely worth buying,black_comedy
very funny definitely entertaining the music might not be eveyones favorite but it suits the story clooney turturro and nelson are great  nelson is especially funny the coen brothers did quite nicely hudsucker proxy greatness ,black_comedy
o brother where art thou 6510i didnt laugh out loud once the coen brothers shouldve went back to the drawing board on this one or perhaps they should have actually read homers odyssey rather than cliff notes or not relied on it at all the whole acknowledgement to homer is just insulting the characters were simply too weird even for a coen brothers film how many blind men were there three or four while i admit that clooney had the best dialogue he was simply too handsomeor out of placefor this film i wanted to laugh whenever he went into one of those pseudointellectual riffs but i couldnt something was wrong about them the film tried to explain it away latereverett went up for practicing law wo a licensebut i wasnt convinced that was just way too convenient storywisethe only genuine thing i saw in all of o brother was the klan scene when it came i couldnt believe it i was right at the edge of thunderous laughter but after 23rds of squat just i couldnt do it i did however rewind the scene its probably the only thing ill remember about the film im not counting the backward trios engaging song im a man in sorrow though while i certainly liked it it was an obvious plot device at its introduction everything felt haphazard truncated predictable i just couldnt get into it which is unusual because im a coen brothers fan so i dont think it was me they the coen brothers were simply off the mark this time go see blood simple or fargo instead 6510,black_comedy
first off i went into the movie a little skeptical yet hopeful that i would be pleasantly surprised  unfortunately the best i can say for it is that it had a few clever scenesbut for the most part i found it to be predictable slowly paced and the writing was well smug is the only word that seems to fit  it strives to be clever for the sake of being clever and the audience pays for it by having to sit through for little to no payoffsorry i thought it was an ok film but nowhere near worthy of the hype it has received,black_comedy
this is a funny film not hilarious as some of these comments may lead you to believe but funny and well written if just a bit disjointed in partsthe evocative super 35 cinematography is outstanding with the colors bleached to an almost mossandwhite spectrum that makes everything look humid hot and smellyclooney as usual is a very limited actor all looks and one expression here he plays the same person he played in er and in the perfect storm  his southern accent comes and goes and his range is from here to here especially when compared to the rest of the excellent cast  hopefully the academy will not confuse him with his costars,black_comedy
the gangs of rockcracking prisoners in the opening scene all singing a dirge in harmony was a great way to start and promised some startling entertainment to follow   but no this contrived comedy with music just went downhill after that  oh dear just tell me when to laugh the ku klux klan scene was quite striking though it did not go anywhere the sirens in their wet clinging garments were nicely seductive the idea of carrying around a friend turned into a toad in a little box was intriguing and a furious escape from a barn all ablaze was exciting enough but may be it was the melodramatic delivery of the lines and the strain of trying to understand the assumed southern accents that got at me  no sir this was a wasted evening for me and one of the worst films of the year my advice brother isforget it,black_comedy
i really had no idea what i was in for with this inappropriately named film i had heard that the music was great but that was like saying that the titanic ran into a little ice  clooney turturro and nelson were comedic kings and the cohens rivaled their fargo for regional humor  the cinematography was beautiful the story just funny enough and i sang the songs in my head for days afterward  it was a real injustice that this film was not nominated as best film among the oscar set and just shows how little they really know i was really impressed at a previously unseen side of george clooney and will see this film again and again you have to just to catch all of the hidden chucklers,black_comedy
the music should costar wgeorge clooney in this wonderful movie about depressionera escaped cons traipsing thru rural mississippi the screenplay is an adaptation of homers the odyssey as cited in the opening credits very strong performances by charles durning john goodman john turturro holly hunter was a big disappointment however she appeared almost as an after thoughtthe photography was beautiful evocative of hot humid summers in the south many scenes were sepiatoned reminiscent of butch cassidysundance kid of years ago the story did drag a bit in the middle,black_comedy
being the fan of the brothers as i am i was scratching at the doors to see this film ive always enjoyed they way they tell a story  this was no exception in the light that they tell a good story but too many cameos and not enought intelligence sink this movie  the brothers never were ones to put the brightest people in there movies barton fink aside  but at least with movies like rasing arizona and fargo the much underrated big lebowski they didnt question the viewers intelligence  this movie went from bad to worse and its a shame because it didnt have to  there was 3 ideas that were used over and over and over again untill the movie was over  not much fun for the viewer  a big dissapointment  3 out of 10 starsrent the big lebowski instead,black_comedy
i have been depressed lately and it has been hard to smile this movie had me and my entire family laughing out loud what a joy to see they can still really make a clean non vulgarfun movie george clooney i forgive you for making the perfect storm and john turturro i love those teeth too see the dvd featurette for this comment and tim blake nelson you are my new idol im throwing away my prozac,black_comedy
a well balanced good time flickthe actionadventure is balanced very with the comedy with a little hint of romance tossed in  the story loosely based on homers epic poem odyssey is very entertaining  the music was outstandingi only had two complaints  first the coen brothers tried to hard to make this picture cute or offthewall  by setting the adventure story in the depressionera south the way they did they did not have to expend all that effort and energy  the nature of the idea alone could have carried it off by itselfsecond george clooneys acting was terrible  he portrayed his role as a charicature as opposed to a character  and that was completely out of step with the whole rest of the moviebut in the end these complaints are trivial in comparison to the final result which is an overall good timenow it is time for me to go out and buy that soundtrack,black_comedy
oof this terrible movie which i regret having wasted any time on is built around racist stereotyping of the lowest sort except the characters are white southerners so i guess that makes it okay  according to o brother where art thou everyone in 1930s mississippi was either a dancing klansmen a  dumb cracker or a generic black victim who gets virtually no lines in the film i think the low point and there were many in this horrible movie had to be putting ralph stanleys sublime masterpiece o death into the mouth of the klan grand dragon as the prelude to a lynching for oldtime music lovers this is roughly the equivalent of what a catholic would feel watching a porn actor belt out ave maria right before a big sex scenegeorge clooney proves once again that he cant act john turturro reminds everyone how well he can charles durning gets a few laughs and gillian welch emmylou harris and the rest of the singers get a paycheck at the expense of their immortal artistic soulshow could the coen brothers makers of some of the best movies of the last 20 years be responsible for this travesty,black_comedy
o brother is a meandering comedy set in 1930s mississippi which tells of the misadventures of three chaingang escapees a highly original and creative piece of work the film amuses taunts and teases as it delivers a cleverly crafted script some unique characters and simple fun with little fanfare as with other coen flicks the hype is after the premier and comes from the audiencethe best kind good fun most likely to be appreciated or understood by mature folkspeople who remember pomade spittoons sparkling oil and phosphates did that car really hit the cow,black_comedy
i have cime to the conclusion that when it comes to films from the coen brothers there is conspiracy going on first it was fargothen the big lebowski and now this each of these films were given rave reviews for being classic comedies the question is why fargo was dull and if it wasnt for willam h macy would have been unwatchable the big lebowski was as funny as piles and now this film takes the biscuit as unfunny as it is boring nothing of any significance happens to make the viewer laugh nothing happens to make this film interesting in any way goerge clooney does his best but the poor script makes it impossible for him to come out of this with any merit who ever decided that this rubbish should be rewarded with a golden globe had fall for what most critics havethe coen con im pleased to say im not following like all the other sheep this film stinks 3 out of 10,black_comedy
a real letdown after the magnificent fargo  one of my alltime favourites  and the highly entertaining the big lebowski for me clooneys performance is nondescript and the movie desperately lacks someone in the lead role with screen charisma the film plants ideas early on that take an eternity to come to fruition  such as the musical talents of the soggy bottom boys  and consequently lacks pace other characters are underdeveloped and sloppily introduced a big shame,black_comedy
this movie proved to be very entertaining in regards to facial expressions of george cloney and supporting cast the overall story line was very good the high level of profanity was very unnerving  i would have enjoyed the movie much more if the language had been cut out,black_comedy
this is not one of those movies that you walk out of the theatre going wow  that was the greatest movie ever but it is good and solid and quite enjoyable especially if you know the odyssey  its fun to see how the coen brothers based their characters on characters from homers epic john goodman as the cyclops is awesome  the visual look of the film is by far the coolest thing about this movieit just looks fantastic,black_comedy
spoilers the coen brothers have done it again in a time where cinematic art and inspiration never ceases to reach new lows they manage to deliver extremely funny and original film adventures with their amazing sense of subtle humor and their unique talent of storytelling the bros present us yet another triumph in a complete series of highlights  not one film of the coens fails to satisfy the audience and that makes them the greatest directors alive at the moment o brother where art thou deserves most of its praising thanks to the sublime structure and the terrific atmosphere the story takes plays in the depressing 30s and the rural way of living in this decade is transferred to the screen terrifically a convicted prisoner escapes but he has to drag along two other not so bright prisoners because theyre chained together the makes them believe there is a buried treasure waiting for them if they stick together they do find many adventures on their way indeedo brother is filled with eccentric and hilarious personalities and each of them has a bunch of bizarre characteristics our three meet a lunatic bank robber whos merely looking for fame instead of fortune a well mouthed bible salesman who doesnt seem to be so religious after all a threesome of wicked but lovely sirens a guitar player who sold his soul to the devil and  top of the bill  they have to face an entire group of the kukluxklan the often melodramatic and depressing subjects are presented with an overload of humor and sarcasm which makes the whole film very unique and typically coen brothers the three heroes even record their own hit and grow to be famous without even knowing it george clooney gives away his best performance ever as ulysess everett mcgillhis charismatic charm and sublime vocabulary fits this movie so well john turturro is a regular cast for the coen brother and no doubt that he does his best work under them very good side roles for john goodman and holly hunter also frequently cast by the coens as well in short few movies come with such high recommendation as o brother where art thou if you appreciate good cinema youll love this film just like all the brothers movies by the way,black_comedy
unmistakably a coen brothers film i first noticed the common denominator between all their films when i was watching fargo for the first time these guys films feel like theyre made up as they go along even if theyre not fortunately the results are always good aside from the disappointing big lebowskii suspect they employed their usual anything goes strategy to o brother this time though whatever story there is seems to take a back seat to what the boys really hoped to accomplish with this film in the liner notes to the films soundtrack the coens describe the film as a sort of valentine to the music of the pregreat depression era there are very few scenes in the movie that dont have an inscreen musical element to them says joel thinking back on the film indeed a scene not driven by music or built around music is hard to find while the boys manage to piece together a quality story by merrying up folklore with the bonafide history of the south its all about incorporating the music somehow some way o brother is about as close as there is to a musical that isnt a musicalto quote the liner notes again before a single frame of film was shot these musicians and others created the canvas upon which the colorful saga of o brother where artthou would be painted so first they had their theme namely spirituality the condition of the soul sin punishment and forgiveness the coens must have felt that as long as they abided by this theme the story would take care of itself any story about the old south could be about the thick mist of good and evil spirits that inhabit it its the american home of both god and beelzebub of more angels and demons than any other region one of the films best sequences features escaped convicts delmar and pete tim blake nelson and john turturro wading into a river to be baptised and cleansed of all sins in the very next scene the convicts nelson turturro george clooney pick up a hitchhiker aptly named tommy johnson played by chris thomas king at a crossroads who tells them hes just sold his soul to the devil so he can play the guitar and make lots of money the four of them then proceed to the next recording studio and cut a hit record together fantasico brother is a playful flaccid romp through the backwoods of mississippi i couldnt help but imagine how much fun these guys were having making this thing and the attitude is contageous its the years funniest film ethans too smart for his own good sometimes though and a lot of it flies right over your head the humor takes you by surprise but doesnt shock youo brother where art thou wont be looked back upon as a coen brothers masterpiece its no fargo or millers crossinggrade a,black_comedy
ive always liked the coen brothers films with my favorites being raising arizona and fargo this one is stylistically good and filmed very well with some fun overthetop performances from george clooney et al but for some reason it didnt resonate with me on any emotional level i found it ultimately fairly forgettable in short its my least favorite of their films i probably wont see it again the soundtrack is wonderful thoughi dont even like countryfolk music as a rule but its stayed in my mind so i just had to go out and buy it its beautifully sung and has some wonderful american folk music on it,black_comedy
this movie is very very unentertaining  its supposed to be a comedy right well it isnt funny nuff said  i saw it in a large sold out theater and the people that were laughing the whole time were people i could just tell didnt get out much  why they picked this movie i dont knowthe problem about o brother is that it was sold as a comedy  now this movie had a pretty good script directing and over all feel the soundtrack is pretty sweet  it just wasnt funny  at all  i think people are trying way to hard to like this movie  i have a huge sense of humor and ever since the big lebowski i have been a fan of coen comedy  but i laughed only once  the good thing is though is that there are plenty of other good movies out to watch instead  your best bet would be to go see traffic and crouching tiger hidden dragon,black_comedy

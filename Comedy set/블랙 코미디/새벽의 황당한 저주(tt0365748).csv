is not only the best zombie flick ive seen in a long time it is simply the best film ive seen in a long time period clever witty sweet and nasty and at times gory and horrific sotd has it all of course i didnt think i could go very far wrong with a film that george romero himself said he enjoyedshaun simon pegg isnt having a very good week his coworkers have no respect for him his uptight stepfather is on his back and his beloved girlfriend liz has had enough of his laziness and inconsideration really shaun isnt such a bad guy but he has no ambition and seems to prefer the company of his unemployed flatulent videogame obsessed slob of a flatmate ed to anyone else and as if this were not enough the dead have risen and are walking the earth in search of human flesh to feast upon shaun doesnt notice this fact as quick as he should but shaun is somewhat of a zombie himself lost in his own world and distracted by his own thoughts as he strolls right past the rotting cadavers that now fill the streets of britain not even news flashes can get through to shaun as in an incredibly hysterical scene he channel surfs rapidly every station finishing the sentence of the one before and giving everyone but the oblivious shaun the grim news of what is happening in the world when shaun and ed finally do realize what is happening it quickly becomes a race against time save shauns mum rescue liz and go to the pub where they can wait out the zombie infestation with a pint and a smoke of course not everything goes as smoothly as planned theres undead flatmates to deal with bitey zombies along the way petty arguments between friends and eds cell phone going off at inopportune moments but shaun armed with a cricket bat is determined to save the woman he loves and nothing is going to get in his waythis film should be seen side by side with romeros dawn of the dead as both films cleverly and sarcastically comment on our zombified society and virtually show no difference between the living and the living dead theres not much gore here but there is one very unexpected and saviniworthy moment in shaun when the zombies rip a living man to shreds yanking out intestines and tearing off limbs i really hadnt seen such a gory scene coming and was too stunned to look away its truly graphic and nauseatingand though i usually hate gore very well done for a low budget film the zombies are pretty menacing looking and there are some genuinely scary moments to be found in shaun theres also several touching scenes between shaun and his mum and dadsorry i mean stepdad shaun himself is forced to grow up and take charge as the zombies close in around them i dont want to give away the incredible ending of shaun except to say that the living dead are not immune from popculture commercialization and though loved ones may die video games are forever see this film you do not have to be a fan of horror movies to appreciate the sublime satire that is i havent seen a movie this good for a very long time 10 stars,black_comedy
is quite a surprising and brilliant piece of work which i suspect will achieve the accolade of instant cult status as word of mouth snowballs this film to richly deserved recognitionsimon pegg both the joint writer and the main star of the film has been a comedic force for some time most notably in the fantastic bbc2 series hippies which inexplicably bombed in the ratings and the cult channel 4 series spaced  both programs hinted at peggs saliently dead pan comedic manner and writing skills which comes to full fruition inin a nut shell this film is a romantic comedy with zombies or zomromcom who appear for no good clear reason although some tantalizing clues are offered  the film is an amazing blend of the funny the violent and the poignantpegg has cast himself as one hell of a serious loser in this film  and not in the american form of i am a loser but i work in tv and have jennifer aniston as my wife  kind of loser as portrayed in tripe such as bruce almighty or dozens of other us loser films  peggs shaun is a genuine loser and extremely recognisable too hes an everyday man who works for an electrical retailer and his life is just plain dull and disappointing  and this is where all the comedy comes from in this film  there are two scenes in the film which seem to summarise this and also shine a light of simon pegg as a very clever and funny writer and both scenes simply involve shaun walking to the nearby corner shop  the first time shaun plods semicomatose to the store we simply get the feeling that he is a loser  however by the time the film shows him making the same journey again we realise that there is a lot more going on  the scene is played with such exquisite subtleness that it has to be one of the funniest scenes i have ever seen in any film not that this film is subtle however there is a stunning array of visual comedy one liners and best of all some digs at other films from the horror genre the funniest being a very subtle snipe at boyles 28 days later  see if you can spot itthe only problem with reviewing this film is that there are so many funny moments in it that it is hard to pick any to write about without spoiling the film  all i can say is that i cannot remember a film ever being this consistently funny with probably five or six serious laughoutloud moments it was a joy to watch and my only disappointment is that i can never watch this film for the first time ever again  every viewing will forever be a repeat viewingis not very everyone though  the language from the beginning is strong and the violence was quite surprising for a 15 certificate film in the uk this film is definitely going to be most appreciated by horror fans who know a huge back catalogue of horror films it will also be enjoyed by teenagers who filled the cinema when i viewed this film which was terrific as they laughed loudest  finally i do have some criticism of this film and that is there is some wasted talent in the movie  black books channel four star dylan moran seemed a bit wasted and so was martin freeman from bbc2s the office  who would have made a terrific zombie  also did i spot matt lucas from bbc3s little britain in this film i am not sure as i was laughing too hard maybethese problems however are so minor and can easily be forgiven  my suggestion is to go and slowly shuffle down to your local cinema to see this film and give simon pegg the money and recognition he deserves so that he can go on and make more films that are this good including what the uk papers have suggested as his next project  from dusk till shaun,black_comedy
isnt your typical zombie movie in fact the zombies dont truly enter the story until almost a third of the way in so whats it really about a man named shaun played by simon pegg who lives in london and is a bit of a loser he works in a deadend job at an electronic goods store and spends most of his spare time at the local pub or playing video games with his unemployed roomate ed one day shauns girlfriend liz decides shes had enough of his lazy attitude and decides to leave him when the city suddenly gets taken over by the living dead shaun finds the perfect opportunity to prove himself to liz so he sets out to save the day win his girlfriend back and keep his mum barbara from being eaten by his stepdad whos slowly turning into a zombiedont let the title and premise fool you this isnt a simple spoof of dawn of the dead its more a romantic comedy that just so happens to be littered with the undead the film is also very clever with a clear social commentary running throughout the jokes that stem from this are absolutely hilarious but will probably be lost on any nonlondoners its actually quite unlikely that this film will translate to anyone outside the uk and this is a real shame and perhaps the films biggest flaw but if you do get it then good for you because there is a lot of great stuff to be seen here the script is wonderful and throws up many comedic moments such as when shaun and ed are looking through shauns lp collection for a suitable vinyl to throw at two oncoming zombies dire straits chuck it or when shaun and his friends beat up an elderly zombie in the pub using cricket bats all to the rhythm of dont stop me now by queen the humour comes thick and fast never have i laughed so consistantly during any film before it only pauses briefly for a few dramatic scenes all of which work surprisingly well in fact the film tends to genrehop quite a lot and while some find this unappealing i think it works in its favour one minute its a comedy then its a drama and then its a full blown horror in fact some scenes are quite jumpy and certainly violent one extremely gory part in particular is a clear homage to another famous horror film that shall remain unamed but if you know what im talking about when you see it then good for you thats the thing about this movie though you dont need to be a horror fan to enjoy it you just need to have the right sense of humour can i explain it well no youll just know if the films for you when you see it i can assure you that most will like it if you dont then i really am sorry for you as this is about the most fun i have had in the cinema since kill bill  ok that wasnt long ago but before that i dont think there was a film that was so riproaringly funny and then unashamedly brutal at the same time there is nothing subtle about this movie and yet it will simply go over the heads of most people i urge you to watch the film and decide for yourself if you love it or hate it its not without its faults though losing its spark slightly during the third act but it comes back with a vengence and gets in some really good jokes just before the credits rollis a great film its funny its clever and its got zombies in it just when the british film industry appears to be dead this gem pops up and shows us what someone with a sense of humour and a real passion for the media can achieve go watch it youll laugh till it hurts,black_comedy

hell kill some zombies too brace yourself for some nonstop zombie action and laughs with the delightful horrorcomedyarmed with a cricket bat razorsharp wit and an attitude shaun simon pegg is perhaps the last guy that youd want to save the world from the legions of the living dead that have suddenly begun to storm the london neighborhood where he lives it could be stated as this is a running gag here that were all dying slow deaths so its no surprise that when zombies begin to eat the flesh of the living shaun couldnt be any more oblivious to the chaos that has gripped most of londonshaun loves his deadend existence of wasting his days at the winchester a local pub with his friend and flat mate ed nick frost the films money shot arrives about 20 minutes in when shaun hungover from a hard nights drinking goes to the store and because hes so hungover and is worried about his exgirlfriend liz kate ashfield he doesnt even notice that the street behind him is teeming with the living deadwhile in the store buying a beverage he doesnt notice the bloody handprints on the refrigerator door and he almost slips in a puddle of blood i was quite amazed at the response this film got from people in the theater it seemed that every time something funny happened the response was almost always with riotous laughterstraight from britain we have what is certainly one of the most original horror movies to come out in a long time even in a genre that embraces gore is fairly light on it at least for the first 45 minutes and is dominated by laughs galoreyou may remember the character of ash bruce campbell of evil dead fame who has remained pretty much the supreme demon slayer in the horror genre but you know campbells pushed past 40 and people today may not be weary of his history slaying evil deadites in sam raimis notorious film series so maybe with the torch has been passed to simon pegg who slays more than his fair share of the living dead in this filmits pretty obvious that sotd was greatly influenced by the works of george a romero the director of 1978s supreme epic of zombie actionmayhem dawn of the dead and 2002s 28 days later directed by danny boyle there are little ittybitty references to the two zombie flicks throughout the moviegranted is aimed largely at the gorehounds who idolized romeros living dead trilogy but its also the first zombie flick to attempt making a hit with the mainstream i guarantee any viewers out there that youll spend more time laughing than you will being frightened1010,black_comedy
here in the states they dont show too many foreign movies even if they are from the countries like uk when they show them however they tend to outdo some of the american movies in the box office although the british movies are rarely shown here theyre a guaranteed success  do you recall the popularity of the last years 28 days later well this movie is even better  its a hilarious combination of comedy social parody tragedy and drama spiced with the references to every zombie flick ever made some references are pretty slim though  for example were coming to get you barbara is a reference to the night of the living dead  a reference that many people including george romero didnt get most of the actors are unknown to an average american yet they played great i hope that movies like will make big wigs in hollywood realize that there are many great foreign movies and that integrity is always better than crude remakes which the states are so notorious for i encourage everybody to come and see sotd  the best comedy of 2004,black_comedy
shaun simon pegg is in the midst of a lousy patchhe hates and is embarrassed about his job he gets no respect from other employees one of his roommates is on his case about the other roommatea slacker friend of shauns his girlfriend is on his case about the fact that all the ever do is hang out at a pub and he hates his stepfather who is also on his case about doing something nice for his mum as if thats not bad enough suddenly everyone is turning into a zombie shaun must both straighten out his life and fight for it at the same timeis a superb blending of horror and comedy ala an american werewolf in london 1981 idle hands 1999 frankenhooker 1990 or the evil dead films beginning with the 1981 original although there is progressively less to more comedy in that series it manages to successfully both pay homage to and spoof a number of classic zombie films and horror film zombie mythology in generalthe film begins firmly in very british comedydrama territory with a number of stylistic directorial flourishes that seem like a cross between darren aronofskys requiem for a dream 2000 and danny boyles trainspotting 1996 the horror material enters gradually beginning with a couple background gags then entering desolation boulevard territory via another boyle reference this time to 28 days later 2002 although that itself was basically a version of the last man on earth aka lultimo uomo della terra1964 based on richard mathesons novel i am legend this arrives in the guise of shaun crossing over to the corner store to buy his morning soda he doesnt notice the deserted streets or store because hes so hung over from the night beforebefore long our ragtag bunch of heroes is in the midst of a fullfledged zombie apocalypseof the traditional slowmoving zombie type acknowledging the cultural differences that strict gun laws bring about they have to use their wits to commit the requisite head busting enlisting unwanted lps after some debate over the merits of each cricket bats shovels and other items for the job of course it would be easier if any of our heroes were the slightest bit athletic and had any aim but they get the job done more or lessfurthering genrefan fun directorwriter edgar wright and cowriter pegg insert a lot of references to other zombie filmsespecially when it comes to explaining the source of the epidemic the scientific explanations given in resident evil 2002 28 days later all of romeros dead filmsbeginning with night of the living dead 1968and possibly even romeros the crazies 1973 and then some are all mentioned in the background but resolutely cut off before theyre finished part of the reason might be that usually the explanations were pretty ridiculous and we didnt really carewe just wanted to get to the cool zombie stuff such as limbs being torn off guts being eaten and brains being blown or smashed out of skullswright and pegg also insert clever nods to the subtexts of zombie films shaun looks and walks like a zombie when hes waking up we see zombie like office workers retail workers and so on theres also an amusing nod to filmic attempts to study and tame zombies as well as organized militaristic defenses both very prominent in 28 days later but present in other films as well there are interesting more subtle and original zombie subtexts in also such as the mirrored scene where shaun and his crew meet up with yvonne and her crewas long as you like outrageous comedy somewhat gory horror and you dont mind mixing the two should provide an enjoyable ride although it is the most fun when youre very familiar with the source material it is spoofing and referencing it is still a great comedyhorror film if viewed with fresher eyes and not so much as a spoof,black_comedy

this is the best mix of beer and blood i have ever tasted has some great comical moments and yet it has been made with lots of professionalism like this was a serious gory horror movie they were making because of this through its seriousness the movie becomes perhaps even more hilarious and really delivers both the fans of the british comedygenre and the fans of mainly zombie movies and other gory horrormovies will be entertained by this movievisually the movie is really good looking its not like many other british movies and has a good looking use of cinematography and lighting the gore makeup and visual effects are extremely good and are even something that i havent even seen in serious zombiehorror flicksyou might think that this movie is just mainly a spoof of dawn of the dead 1978 but its really more than that the movie is good and creates a good story on its own so that it becomes more than just a simple spoof all of the characters are well written and are funny in their own waythe acting is good for comedy standards and the actors perfectly know how to play in both hilariousfunny scenes as well as in seriousemotional ones plus of course it has the wonderful bill nighy playing a role in it this guy really is a terrific actor that always is at his best in comical roles like he plays in this moviebasically this is a very good looking and professionally made movie that also is funny and hilarious at moments i cant see how anyone could not like this movie810httpbobafett1138blogspotcom,black_comedy
the great british sitcom has undergone something of a revival in recent years galvanised by the new wave of smart sassy imports from the us the brits have girded their loins and produced a spate of quality comedies that have banished memories of the bland identikit dross of the late eighties and early ninetiesone such series is spaced a wholly original and delightfully quirky comic bagatelle which has built up a small but dedicated following in the uk now writeractor simon pegg and director edgar wright have teamed up once again to give us which is in a nutshell a featurelength episode of spaced with added zombies happily timed to coincide with the hollywood remake of the 1978 classic shocker dawn of the dead shaun is the perfect antidote irreverent warm and very funnyshaun pegg is your stereotypical sitcom loser an ineffectual slob in a deadend job he is terminally afraid of commitment and spends all his time with his flatmate ed nick frost also from spaced who is an even bigger loser after his girlfriend dumps him shaun and ed seek solace in their local pub the winchester  a good oldfashioned english hostelry with warm beer and pork scratchings which is infamous for its lockins they stagger home in a state of advanced refreshment unaware that the dead are now walking the earth indeed it takes shaun a little while to work it out the following morning despite interacting with a few of them one of the recurring themes is that most of us go through the drudgery of our daily routines in a trance close to inertiawhen the penny drops shaun resolves to rescue his mother and his ex girlfriend and generally stand up for himself for the first time in his life there is not much more of a plot than that the film like spaced relies on a flawless script observational humour and the theatre of the absurd pegg has perfected this in his writing but he is also a surprisingly good actor it helps that he has surrounded himself with the pick of the british comedy fraternity who seem to have been lining up literally in one scene for a cameo the stars of similarly acclaimed series such as black books the office and little britain are all on show here as well as jessica stevenson peggs spaced cowriter who plays a jollyhockeysticks human vigilante with a stiffupper lip and cando attitude ready to give those nasty zombies whatforveteran support comes from penelope wilton a sitcom stalwart from a bygone age as shauns curtaintwitching mother and bill nighy as her fearsome second husband who performs one of the most dignified and poignant descents into zombieness ever caught on cameradespite all the high praise it must be acknowledged that is still a spoof  a comic tool that you could argue is as low a form of wit as sarcasm but where it scores highly is in its respect for the original material most spoofs the scary movie franchise for example are vicious lampoons that unmercifully mock the films they are taking off gently pokes fun but doesnt lose sight of the fact that if something is worth parodying it must have some merit pegg is also careful to ensure that his film can stand up on its own  there is barely a minute goes by without a very good joke and despite the lightheartedness there are some satisfyingly scary moments and ample gorewhat is most encouraging is that us brits have started playing to our strengths it took a long time for comedy writers to realise that making an english version of friends is doomed to failure in the same way that the office will not work with an american makeover we should celebrate the britishness of this film laugh knowingly at the in gags and be proud that it doesnt take a huge budget or movie stars to entertain people at the cinema810,black_comedy
some 5 years before the making of this film the same team behind it wrote and directed series season 1 and 2 of an offbeat uk sitcom named spaced massively overlooked at the time of broadcast yet with a hardcore fan base of loyal devotees a third series was long overdue but never did materialiseis the continuation of what went before of a similar format yet in a completely new setting with new characters plus new cast members and for the first time a featurelength run time for the big screen so how does it play out even with such a departure from the original setting the history of tv to cinema adaptations is a dodgy one to say the least fortunately for those of us who already fans or more likely if youve never seen the series before prepare to be impressedthe style is all its own with inventive direction and editing making the visual impact which fans will instantly recognise to the writing which importantly is firstly genuinely funny interspersed with references to popular culture of the past two decades always with a selfknowing grin a wink to the viewer rather than a pretentious nod and of course several selfreferences and injokes of the tv series all fill in the gaps between the tastefully presented killings there is blood after all this is a romzomcom or romantic zombie comedy  a selfproclaimed new genre and rightly so this is as about as original as it gets they actually manage to pull off humour violence decapitations action romance suspense sadness and joy all within the space of 90 minutesthis is the best film ive seen in ages and a real credit to british film we already knew about fried gold now the rest of the world can see it too an instant classic,black_comedy
is in a word brilliantive seen this movie at least 10 times and it never gets old makes me laugh at each viewing having seen dawn of the dead i was expecting just another spoof as the name implies but was pleasantly surprised to find a completely original story with some great comedy moments and superb acting all around not to mention buckets of gore the first of the romcomzom genre will certainly set the standard for future zombie flicks of its kind and i can see pegg having a bright future in comedy go rent it nowtom patterson,black_comedy
i was really looking forward to enjoying a quirky english comedy but from start to finish i just could not get intoit should be noted that im generally not a fan of zombie movies the genre has always seemed to focus on gore effects and thrills over plot and innovation but i didnt think this would be an issue since shaun is a spoofbut its not a spoof or at least not entirely a spoof shaun is a conglomeration of spoof satire horror thriller fantasy romance and of course comedy very rarely do i enjoy movies that attempt to bridge more than three genres simultaneously the only similar movie i can recall for comparison is mars attacks 1996i had some laughs but overall i could not slip into the proper mindset to enjoy this film even though i desperately wanted to at times it was clever and creative by placing average joes in bizarre zombie situations but at the same time it suffers from all those traits that infuriate and annoy me in horror and thriller moviesin short the primary problem was an inability to empathize with the characters one reason i dont care for horror movies is because the main characters are generally morons shaun himself was no exception he repeatedly makes poor choices and either under or over reacts to all sorts of situations his mother is a cross between senile and dimwitted ed is borderline retardedtruthfully in real life i cant stand people like shaun they are so absorbed in their own problems that they are completely oblivious to their surroundings and events around them they have no one to blame but themselves for their predicaments the characters just dont seem to behave realistically which would be fine if the movie was an outright satire sketch like monty python but its notall in all i give a 6  10 still worth a watch,black_comedy
is set in london where shaun cowriter simon pegg has problems his fat mate ed nick frost is holding him back his girlfriend liz kate ashfield dumps him  then theres the small matter of hordes of flesh eating zombies that risen from the dead to feast on the living however shaun has a plan to save himself his mate his exgirlfriend  his mum  stepdad which involves barricading themselves into his local pubthis british french coproduction was cowritten  directed by edgar wright  i have to say i was left a little disappointed by it  i cant quite see where all the glowing praise for it comes from the script by star pegg  wright is obviously a nice homage to george a romeros dead films although to be honest id sooner watch romeros splattergore films than this odd mixture of comedy romance  horror is all very british  maybe the novelty of it wins people over especially those who dont live here in britian unfortunately i do live here  it just doesnt have quite the same affect on me apparently both pegg  wright were involved in the british comedy series spaced which to be honest ive never heard of  maybe thats where a lot of its fans come from anyway its a moderately successful film  certainly a watchable one its amusing its pretty clever  well written it has plenty of fun references to other films its a fairly fun film but i found it to be too spoofy it goes to far into the direction of silliness  some of the things that happen just annoyed me im in two minds really i will openly admit its a fun watch but i didnt think it was as brilliant as many seem to think i doubt id watch it again anytime soon  i didnt have as much fun with it as id hoped overall id say i was a little disappointeddirector wright does a good job its shot like a tv soap opera at times although he manages to juggle the comedy romance  horror quite well its not scary  i didnt find it laugh out loud funny either but im sure many of you out there dowill i like the laddish approach that the modern british male would barricade themselves in a pub  wait for it to blow over rather than head for the plush  sensible surroundings of a supermarket as seen in dawn of the dead 1978 theres some gore someone is torn apart at the end there are someone gunshot wounds to the head but little else worth mentioningwith a supposed budget of about 4000000 is well made although there isnt a great deal of style or flair to it the acting is good  the cast make their characters pretty likableis a decent fun homage to romeros zombie films to be brutally honest id rather see one of those again than this though worth a watch for sure but not as good as id hoped  i feel its slightly overrated,black_comedy
shaun is in his late twenties and works in a electrical store with teenagers  he hangs out with his slobbish friend and spends every evening in the winchester pub  fed up with this his girlfriend dumps him leaving him with the words of his other flatmate ringing in his ears  sort your life out  his plans take an unexpected turn when he and ed eventually notice that londons populace has mostly given into a virus that turns them into well the z word  shaun and ed devise a plan to keep safe and rescue shauns mother and exalthough the makers were cursing themselves for the unfortunate timing of this films release with the much bigger budget remake of dawn of the dead  however for me this served as a rather nice experience after the straightscares of dawn  a point to note for all those moaners is that this film went into production before the remake did  anyway ignoring this issue it is important to note that the film is a very british affair and is aimed at a very particular sense of humour  in essence if you love spaced then youll enjoy this  the film is not a spoof  it is a horror movie with laughs not unlike evil dead in that regard  the gags are good but not as fast as spaced fans will be used to  instead they are put in with the horror rather than being forced over the top of itthe film has movie references but not to the point where they become the gags themselves spaceds cutaways for example  in place of that we have references to deer hunter and the matrix that are funny but will not spoil things for you if you dont spot them  i laughed throughout but it is important not to expect to be rolling in the aisles  the film is still a horror not a naked gun style spoofas a horror the film is not really scary but does have a good gutful of gore to go around  the zombies are slow and this will not work for modern audiences but it does hark back to the old zombie flicks and also allows the material to work  i closed my eyes a few times as the film provided blood and it does have the odd moment that is touching  of course the laughs are everything and aside from a slow start and a more horrorfocused ending this is consistently funnythe one thing that it also does well is have a slight satirical edge to it it is delivered rather heavily early scenes of hooded youths lumbering around force the point home too heavily but it is still true  having done my shopping in asda just before seeing this film i can definitely contest that many of us lumber around in a semitrance  this is a nice touch  the dawn remake lacked any of the comment that its original made so it is good to have some here  again however nonbrits may not totally pick up on this as we seem to be one of the few countries that has this puborientated culturethe cast are great and will be full of faces recognisable from the tv series that this film will draw the majority of its fans from  pegg is great he is a slightly more advanced version of his spaced character and he makes for a good leading character simply because he is so recognisable  this is not a hollywood film with characters we dont know but instead a bloke from a pub  despite the fact that i would hate ed in real life frost is hilariously exaggerated  he looks very different from spaced but he does well with the material  ashfield is spunky and the only downside to her is that she would never be with shaun in the first place  support is good from moran davis and nighy  there are plenty of injokes for fans including a great cameo from stevenson who also shows up with her own group of friends that mirror shauns friends in terms of looks and pretty much tv series background eg tim from the office and fran from black booksoverall this will not please everyone and i fear that some will not laugh as much as the adverts and hype suggested  however it is a good horror comedy and easily the best british film of the year so far  fans of spaced will notice the joke rate is scaled back but it is still very funny  the humour of spaced has reached the big screen and is doing good things for the british cinema industry  the makers said they threw so much into the film horror comedy romance drama gore because they didnt think they would be allowed to make another film  i hope to god that is not the case,black_comedy
please tell me cause i cant telli cant believe the reviews saying that this was good cause it wasnt i really love zombie movies but this is just horrible the jokes were awful the situations were obvious and very predictable and the story itself was really bad and stupid the end is even worst i think this is the worst zombie movie ive seen this year dont waste your time watching this and dont let them make you think this is good please take my advice keep yourself away from this thingby the way i didnt laugh not even onceangel luna,black_comedy
this may sound odd but what makes this comedy about londoners fending off zombies with vinyl albums and cricket bats so terribly funny is that its so utterly believable every character is someone you know every interaction is something youve experienced every emotion is one you know except with flesheating zombiesa brilliantly observed comedy makes shrewd points about the nature of mass media and consumer culture the banality of everyday life love friendship fear and heroism it also pokes fun at traditional zombie movies with the undead moving so slowly that shaun and ed have time to go through their album collection to determine which records are too precious to be slung at their shuffling assailants the humour is occasionally gross but always funny the observations about how real people would react to an entirely surreal situation are spot onan instant comedy classic,black_comedy
ok i am really not one of these the worst movie ever gang member but this one was really bad i mean it i tried so hard to enjoy a little bit but i didnt smile even one time i dont know how this movie can be rated 8 but first time in my life i am giving such a confident 1 and if there was a chance to give something lover i would from the beginning to the end it is so slow and the jokes are so bad if you really want to watch it fasten your seat belt not to escape screaming and drink one liter of coffee so that you dont sleep it is not only the plot the acting was bad as well i didnt find the characters funny overall bad bad and plain bad,black_comedy
i am completely nonplussed why this torture of a movie seems to be everyones favorite on top of that its inclusion in the top 250 is bloody outrageous not once did i laugh or even crack a smile in this movie on the other hand i was getting irate by the second watching all of em on a nonsensical plot simon pegg was an unexpected nasty surprise in this movie as i did not expect that type of dull performance from the brilliant actor and the way they handle the situation with his mom is absolutely rubbishpoor very poor go for zombieland which should take this ones place in the top 250 oh and btw so titanic should be in the 250 too,black_comedy
zombie films are something that many people have tried to make and many people have failed to make well even george romero and lucio fulci it must be admitted do not have the midas touch in this genre this goes ably to show that even when its a single genre of horror its difficult to pin downmultigenre combinations are typically even more difficult to accomplish successfully and unfortunately thats exactly what tries to do it fails in more or less every way that it possibly can its not wellacted its not funny its not scary and above all its really not entertaining or amusing its depressing and sad and the films end leaves one with a sense of futility and pointlessness a sense of having wasted the entire running time on a completely and utterly meaningless thingthe whole film is spent with unsympathetic and unlikable clods who manage somehow to survive as long as they do through sheer luck and no real ability or even desire to persevere the humour is hardly passable even by todays standards its often either crass and unfunny or simply unsubtle and unfunnythe script is as pedestrian as possible with attempts at tugging the heartstrings merely coming off as manipulative and illogical especially given the subsequent resolution the film gets if the viewer is not furious then he clearly wasnt paying attention and the scriptwriters certainly werent paying attention as the scripts coherency is laughable even for a comedy it ought to be much tighter than this happens to beafter people raving about its easy to go in either extreme direction people jump on the bandwagon easily especially when friends recommend something and eventually it reaches a point where people who havent even seen the film are recommending it to others the overblown nature of the film however makes judgement of it much harsher if it had been simply the smalltime film that it probably was intended to be it might be easier to forgive however as an overrated cult classic it is not worth the praise heaped upon it for being something it is not namely enjoyable,black_comedy
without a doubt is one of the worst comedies if not the worst that hit the big screen in 2004 the characters of the film have iqs all shy of 75 every single one is borderline retarded the zombies has more of a mental capacity than those of the living i did not laugh nor so much as break a smile during this entire film anyone who has left a review that has stated that this movie is funny you have been warned the entire film takes place in about 2 locations with very few movements along the way i wasted over an hour of my life to watch this garbagefurthermore ive browsed some of the reviews that have been previously written where some of you say that us americans cant understand the english comedy due to various reasons trust me when i say that that isnt the problem here the problem isnt the dialect nor the fact that the film boasts primarily english actors the problem with this movie is that the actors are all c class actors the problem is that they all lack common senseintelligence above and beyond the norm the screenplay is downright awful and it was just as pathetically acted poor acting poorly written and poorly thought out  an extremely poor filmthere is no reason to watch this you will not laugh you will not smile you will waste your time if you are looking for a good quality horrorcomedy film i suggest you watch tucker  dale vs evil that movie is without a doubt hands down 10x better than this film here i have yet to watch zombieland but would also be willing to go out on a limb and suggest that that film as well has got to be betterthanks for reading my review and i certainly hope you take it into consideration,black_comedy
2004i know that many people will disagree with this opinion but i really dont care what anyone thinks this is crap of the highest order but more importantly it is not funny no it is not funny not funnya laughable attempt to spoof zombie films which on average are crap to produce the apex of modern cinematic trash im sorry but i cant say much else except that is an insult to british comedy and comedy in generalsadistically boring110,black_comedy
oops to me this movie was a total disappointmentperhaps too much british humor that i dont understand but nothing on this movie reflects the current imdb ratingvery few lines in the movie made me smirk and no line at all made me laughi would not recommend anyone to watch this move but if you are curious about the rating and if it deserves it or no it is a 130h movie so be my guest and watch itthe acting was good i might add but that does not add up for the poor plotwaste of time 310,black_comedy
edgar wright created this masterpiece of a comedy back in 2004 which i still watch today im in love with the characters created not only by wright but also by frost and pegg ill never get enough of these two brilliant movie,black_comedy
2004 is an extremely creative and entertaining film created by famed director edgar wright showcasing some of the snapzooms and whippans that would later serve as his trademarks as well as his use of dark humor and gags this is a film that shows a master of cinema in the making while paying tribute to a genre that has long been rehashed hilarious and even at times touching performances from pegg and frost to boot  just good ol bloody fun,black_comedy
the movie starts great i liked the actors setting camera work and the way the apocalypse got teasedworks for a while but ultimately at one point isnt outstandingly entertaining anymoreit still sort of is cult for the good parts also the ending is alright again after the movie fell off a biti think its comparable to hot fuzz in terms of consistency parts of the movie just are great and cult while other parts feel a bit dragging and forced,black_comedy
okay even though i surely dont regret having watched this film i wont be joining the other reviewers around here who all claim its a hilarious movie andor the best horror comedy in decades the intentions of cast and crew are good there are plenty of good gags and the characters are likable but overall it feels like something is missing it sure isnt obvious to mix a splatterhorror subgenre with comical situations so the premise of this doesnt work all the time nevertheless theres enough ingeniousness and originality to make this a worthwhile film the setting of a grey banal london suburb with its typical inhabitants suits the story really well and the actors do their absolute best to provide this film with a human character but its not as hilarious as it looks and its simply impossible to uphold a lightheaded atmosphere when youre dealing with an apocalyptic theme in case youre not familiar with the plot 29yearold shaun is stuck in his monotonous life of deadend job nagging mother and lowlife roommate his more ambitious girlfriend breaks up with him and just when he plans to make some serious changes to win her back a mysterious disease resurrects the dead and turns the living into an endangered species while the army of ravenous zombies keeps on growing shaun rescues his girl and some friends by bringing them to their favorite pub some of the gags like when the gang learns to move like zombies in order to keep a low profile are really good but the film is a bit too long and the drama eventually overrules the horror actually the very best aspects in are the numerous references towards milestone zombie movies but i fear these sublime findings are a bit lost on wider audiences brings homage to the romero trilogy the evil dead and many italian classics for true horror fans its a joy to track down all the subtle tributes overall this gem sure is worth renting but the hype in enjoys at the moment is a bit unmerited,black_comedy
i wasnt screaming my head off in laughter sad to say but it was a good smile itd probably be better if id watch more dawn of the dead movies i guess overall this movie is begging for a sequel it certainly better than 28 days later but i failed to find the massive comedy everyone was talking about perhaps its because its more like scream than evil dead 2 the latter evil dead movies are very hilarious so that might have taken some of the punch out but i liked it and hope to see more like it maybe theyll cure the guys friend out in the shed  lol  sorry i dont do playstation710 quality 710 entertainment 610 replayable 810,black_comedy
this truly is one of the worst and most excruciatingly boring movies ive ever had the misfortune of sitting through if this is the best of british then we are in an even worse state than i thought i cant believe this is being billed as refreshing and ground breaking comedyits about as funny as a poke in the eye with a sharp stick it follows the trend of so many other brit comedies by going with crass toilet humour jokes about fartingmy how originalwhat a wheezei dont thinkit was funny 20 years ago but it aint bloody funny nowi can just picture the hordes of greasy wacky students rolling in the ailes all over the countrythe rest of you should know better,black_comedy
i guess you could call this a combination of dawn of the dead and snatch the latter used as a comparison because of its modernday dark humor thats what this film is a combination of irreverent modernday attitudes and profanity from young brits and a remake of sorts of a famous horror filmhere we these these 20ish types fighting a mob of the undead as zombies roam neighborhoods devouring everyone our hero simon pegg a shiftless bum who has just lost his girlfriend due to his ineptness winds up being the productive guy who saves the day and gets his girl back along the way we get a number of laughs and a number of grossout horror scenes and a lot of f words and the like nick frost as simons best friend provides the best and most disgusting of the lowlife characters which are unfamiliar over herethis is dark humor to say the least and would would appeal more to younger people although i like dark humor and im an old fartbut others over 50 beware it was good entertainment in a crude way my only complaint was trying to understand some of the sentence and british phrases of the day,black_comedy
 spoilers before i start with the review id like to make clear that i am a huge fan of anything that has anything to do with zombie films i see all i can get my hands on whether they get good or bad reviews and whether ive heard anything about them or not shan of the dead seemed like a cool idea for a movie at least prior to when i saw the trailer after seeing the trailer i thought id give it a chance anyway something not recommended to others since thats those 99 minutes of your life that youre never going to get backone of the main problems with this movie is the characters for good drama you need suitable characters to move the story forward lacks this vital component in many instances its hard to tell what the screenwriter was thinking the following characters inherit this film the main character shaun he is an ugly loser with nothing going for him he feels sorry for himself the whole film through all the way to the ending but its really his own fault that he is a big loser shaun has a friend who lives off him and shauns other roommate this guy is a lazy fat and disgusting slob with no sense of responsibility whatsoever i forgot to mention that he deals marijuana as his only way of income adorable isnt it shauns second roommate has a job  a sense of responsibility and seems to know whats right or wrong constantly throughout the short period of time that this character still survives he is being called names behind his back by his friends and he is the one who dies firsthold up a second here somethings wrong the unsympathetic main characters are morons who nobody can identify with and the only sensible person in the trio gets killed off quickly you cant build a movie like this if you cant identify yourself with the protagonists you wont care what happens to this and then the movie will not draw you in i wont bore you with descriptions the rest of the characters but its basically the same drill as with the ones ive already mentionedanother problem with the film is that its a bit schizophrenic in the sense that it doesnt know what kind of movie it wants to be it certainly is no romantic comedy because 1 lets face it how romantic are zombies really and 2 its a failed attempt at comedy since very few jokes actually are funny maybe the last one is because its a british sort of humor that i dont get anyway the up until the last 20 minutes the movie tries to be a comedy then however it gets 100 percent serious and turns into some sort of splatterhorrordrama this film is not a good film and its one of the worst zombie films ive seen and ive seen some pretty bad ones,black_comedy
everything about this movie annoys me and i mean everything especially peoples irritating affection for it it has cult status well what has happened to the moonies i askits main crime for me is that it isnt funny  the joke is that silly bumbly but really quite lovable sean finds his very normal life turned upside down when zombies come to town well there we are to me that story is worth perhaps five minutes as a sketch or maybe an advert selling spare parts but a full length feature film noin fact the fact that the story lagged and was predictable and dull wasnt what did it for me i just cant stand sean penn he reminds me of jerry lewis in the king of comedy his portrayal of a charming buffoon is rather like being forced fed chocolate muffins he is the adult equivalent of a child star pushing the all the buttons so efficiently but with absolutely no conviction or sincerity,black_comedy
what i cant understand is why this movie is soooo overrated there is nothing in the movie to laugh at allthere are so lame and childish kind of jokes that i hardly even laugh in the whole moviethis movie is actually a disrespect for all the zombies movies out thereand what an idiotic end to the movieyou would be like omg what have i just watchedeven though the genre is comedy but really  this movie is clearly an insult to zombie filmi mean cmon even if your making a zombie spoof make it at least tolerablesave your time and money and watch some real zombie movies like 28 dayweeks later or just watch walking dead rather than watching this i usually dont write reviews but this movie made me write onesuch a poor comedy and directioni dont know why people are giving it so much rating  the movie has such a lousy start and theres nothing till half the time and zombies are such like they would walk like snail i dont even know whats the story in the movie other than zombie which are also poorly madeeven for a comedy movie this movie suck big time,black_comedy
i am a big fan of what i would still call pulp and others would call pulp fiction this is because good pulp can say more than pretentious literature or cinema can even aim to saytells the story shaun an ordinary guy who lives life is a dead end and when his girl friend dumps him his best friend tell him it is not the end of the world but he is wrong it is because the dead have started to walk the earth and feed on the flesh of livingwhat we get is basically a funny little comedy involving zombies on one hand i can argue that pophorror works because it takes itself seriously and uses humour to cover the lack of budget so turns horror completely into a comedy missing the point on the other hand i dont know any movie that has ever really delved deeply into zombies while other unspeakable evils such as vampires werewolves and lawyers have all been suitably looked at so zombies are always good for a laugh and treating a zombie movie as a comedy makes more sensethat sums up the movie good for a laugh never rises above that it contains over 10 times your daily requirement pop culture references and with the best ending to a zombie movie that i have seen,black_comedy
i watched it today on the insistence of many other zombie film fans that stated it was somehow one of the best if not the best zombie film and definitely feel cheated during and after watching which can only lead me to say that its highly overratedit fell very flat to me and i didnt find it amusing at all nor special in any way not to say its bad its perfectly acceptable  but i certainly didnt think it was worthy of this cult classic label that people give it and the high rating it has here on imdbcom and all the talk it gets about ithonestly i have no idea why people recommend it the way they do i get that humor and what people find entertaining is subjective  but i just dont understand the appeal herethere are definitely better zombie genre films with better stories and better characters out there to enjoy compared to this one,black_comedy
this was one of the most awful movies ive ever watched its not at all funny even though its supposed to be a comedy and its a crappy horrorzombie movie really i have no idea why this movie has a rating of 80 out of 10 total disappointmentshauns nearing 30 stuck in a crappy sales job and his girlfriend liz is unhappy with the amount of time he spends with his ultraslacker bclass drug dealer friend ed at their local pub the winchester when liz dumps him shauns so glum he doesnt even realise that londons been overrun with flesheating zombies but somewhere within his consolehappy lazy self a hero is born,black_comedy
to see that people really enjoyed this filmaside from good looking zombies and one well rendered day of the dead homage gore scene this movie is really not funny nor interestingthe humor is meant to be understood and appreciated by our own societys living dead easy adolescent winkwink fratfart jokes and situations are so abundant in this film its just sad to see that people still laugh at that zgrade sitcom crapthe pacing is ridiculous such as the zombies they attack whenever the characters have finally completed their lines and other zombie rules are simply overlooked for the sake of the scripts advancementimbecile characters for an imbecile audience unfortunately this is a winning combo and will sell well to the massmakes me sigh in pity when i read that some say its better in all aspects than peter jacksons braindead,black_comedy
i had heard so many good reviews about this movie  best british comedy in years etc etcso was surprised at how absolutely unfunny and pointless this grueling 100min feature was  i was constantly squirming in my seat and not because i was frightened but because i was desperate to escape this torture i was being subjected toi think i laughed about three times throughout the film and i didnt hear too many other laughs coming from the rest of the audienceif this is humor then you can bash me over the head and finish me off like the zombiesbe warned,black_comedy
i cant believe there are people who actually like this movie the ones that actually gave this movie a good review must really like this kind of humorthis movie is so lame that i watched nearly the first 10 minutes and i couldnt take it i waited a few days and tried again but it is still the bad movie that it isthis move tries to be satirical and funny but instead it fails at everything possibleno laughs not even a sympathy laugh even a great movie two can play at that game was much better than this rubbish skip this movie however if lame supposed british humor is your thing you just might like it,black_comedy
simon pegg cannot act and is not funny so imagine my disdain when i see him trying acting in a alleged comedy the plot is non existent zombies attack and hilarity is supposed to ensueunfortunately like every other movie pegg is in i spent an hour and a half waiting for something funny to happen the credits must have beat them to italmost every other person in the film including his long time friend frost is able to make the audience suspend their disbelief until mr pegg ruins it all again with his stilted freshly memorized acting work take my advice dont get dragged along to see his latest travesty because of how many brainless dolts think it looks mind alteringly funny  deep down you just know it will be worse than showgirls,black_comedy
britain excels at a certain type of comedy any time there is comedy to be had in the mundanity tragedy and petty minutae of everyday life you can be sure that britain is the country to handle it leave the pratfalling to other people  britain has honed this particular style of comedy for yearsso explain how this film got it so badly wrong i loved the office which this film clearly wants to be  but this film seems to have completely missed the point it is like a film student trying to make a tarantinoesquire film and eschewing a good script and hip funny dialogue you know  the things tarantino is actually good at for a series of slowmotion action sequences set to a retro soundtrack in short they have missed the best parts of the comedy style the awkward glances the tragicomedy etc for broadsafe humour and it doesnt workbut people tell me  isnt it great to have a zombie film that pokes fun at the genre isnt it original no its not dawn of the dead was using the genre in a similar way long long before this film came out and was far cleverer and more subversive than this film could ever hope to bei never laughed once during this tryhardtobequirky piece of nonsense watch it if youre looking for an average bit of slapstick comedy if you want something cleverer and more uniquely british watch any number of classic bbc comedies,black_comedy
its time for a serious levelheaded review ofthis movie is one of the most overhyped of the year im tired of everyone calling it an instant cult classic this phrase doesnt make any sense a cult classic is a film that no one sees by has a small but loyal following was a big hit when it was released her back in april and it seems like it will do the same when its released in america thanks to the alarmingly widespread positive wordofmouth everyone seems to be caught up in the offcentre comedy to realize that the film is heavily conflicted and doesnt add upfirst of all this is not a romzomcom or whatever there is no romance just a guy who wants to make up with his girlfriend while zombies get in the way and to call it a comedy would be totally wrong anyone paying the slightest iota of attention would see this film is not a comedy some funny moments yes but not all the waylike most other zombie flicks there is no explanation to why britain is suddenly overrun by the undead the plague slowly trickles to life from the odd zombie stumbling around to fullblown hoards of them amidst this shaun simon pegg and ed the great nick frost make fun of the undead and go about dealing with the holocaust in their own silly waythere are some pretty hard scenes of heavy emotion is this film i want say what but some characters do die that totally contradict the comedy label its been stuck with and despite some scenes of graphic violence this is not a horror film its not a comedy a romantic comedy a spoof or homage it simply doesnt know what it is many people believe they got a breath of fresh or should that be old air when it was revealed the film would have slow zombies and not the faster ones like in dotd 2004 and the dreadful 28 days later i personally do not understand this overused moan slow zombies are not scary there is no threat from them starts out very stupid and slow the opening scenes of people doing the repetitive things day in day out are not subtle at all and hammer the point to the audience way too forcefully then when the zombies first appear the characters and the audience dont fully realizeappreciate the danger until the last five minutes when the film finally becomes exciting and then thats when we get really ripped off the film ends way too quickly and conveniently what a let down after building up so much only to collapse back into the stupid tone the film began inhorror buffs will like the zillions of injokes and references to other horror movies to the casual viewer they will go right over your head its about the only thing thats consistent throughout the whole filmdont listen to the word of overexcited reviewers who are inexplicably giving this film 5 stars it is in no way the classic they are making it out to be good yes entertaining yes the best movie youve ever seenbest zombie movie everyadda yadda yadda definitely not has great potential come from inspiring sources but the end result is not what the hype is telling youalready out in uk the dvd has great 2351 anamorphic picture with dolby 51 sound and zillions of extras including audio commentary from actorwriter simon pegg and director edgar wright audio commentary from actors simon pegg nick frost dylan moran kate ashfield and lucy davis audio commentary from actors bill nighy and penelope wilton audio commentary from the zombies extended bits with audio commentary outtakes the man who would be shaun simon pegg and nick frost impersonate sean connery and michael caine plotholes comic strip sequences with voiceover from lucy davis simon pegg and nick frost including what happened to shaun when he ran offwhat happened to diane when she left the winchesterhow did ed get from the cellar to the shed extended edits of the tv shows within the movie coldplay on t4  fun deadtrishayour nine lives are uptrishai married a monster remembering z day an interview with jeremy thompson electronic press kit featurette vignettes simons camlucys camjoes diary edgar wrights and simon peggs flip chart a presentation of the first draft sfx comparison from double negative makeup tests photo gallery photos by simon lucy and charlotte poster designs from the original oscar poster to the final official poster 2000ad strip theres something about mary tv spots official trailer official teaser trailer fright fest exclusive trailerphew for those with a multiregion dvd player get the r2 dvd version otherwise youll have to wait until september 24 my birthday for the film to be released nationwide in america,black_comedy
as with hot fuzz these directors had the same problem in this earlier production which most story writers have the hardest battle with to create a story line with all the strings tied together into a complete movie with a good endingalthough hot fuzz turned out to be a real story mess feels like it is able to stay on track the longer mainly probably because the story line in a typical zombie movie is so easily predictable to copywith that said i can only say that follows the now typical pattern of a great start with a meh ending,black_comedy
this is such a forgettable little film that i forgot i ever even saw it until i read the movies title on imdbs top 250 so why is this watchable but unfunny comedyhorror movie there there are several explanations for this strange occurrence1 the usual explanation that most moviegoers have zero taste 2 a bunch of brits gave it high marks for patriotic reasons 3 there was a computer or human error in averaging the votesratingsthe gags are cheapobviouspredictable the movies comedy consisting mainly of a bunch of average actors clowning around if this movie is supposed to represent the british revival i dont want to know what would represent its downfall a far cry from peggs later comedies,black_comedy
when my family told me they wanted to see i was less than thrilled i thought it would be just another spoofsatire on all the zombiehorror movies that have previously been releasedwas i in for a surprise although the first 1015 minutes of laying the foundation of the movie seemed to be the typical droll dry brit humor and i do mean dryand very unimpressive the movie took a turn during this first 1015 minutes i was thinking of reasons why i should leave my seat and do anything  go to the bathroom get popcorn etc however i was helplessly stuck as i had already powdered my nose and had a hot dog on my lap all of a suddenthe movie picked up rapidly when shaun and his hopeless roommate find a little drunk girl in the garden zombie and the poor guys came to the realization she was a monster this was the turning point when matters turned from severely dry to utter hysteria the plot was exceptional when you think of two average and less than average joes trying to deal with a zombie in the back yard when they tried to throw kitchen utensils and yes a toaster at her the whole theater was roaring i especially loved the old record collection that shaun frantically used to throw at other zombies and at the same time the methodical and selective process of which albums he wanted to throw and which he wanted to keepthe ways in which this average town first of all overlooked the zombies just another day in town ho hum and then dealing with them and at one point trying to blend in so they could make their way to the winchester pub im laughing even as im typing was hilarious just walk like a zombie dont say a word and they wont know the difference too bad shaun and his exgirlfriend had to get into the inevitable spat and blow their coverthis was an unexpected treasure of a movie with fresh and innovative writing i would recommend this movie to all moviegoers,black_comedy
not a single laugh i thought 810 movie would be a lot better than this movie,black_comedy
this is supposed to be a romantic zombie comedy however its not romantic scary or funny none of the characters are interesting or entertainingthe new zealand film braindead is of this genre mix and is massively better despite being filmed on a much smaller budget over a decade earlier,black_comedy
what is this this film cannot possibly be called a comedy it is barely funny at all the gore takes over the comedy in every way i watched this as a dvd on my 15th birthday and kept me terrified for weeksthe plot sucked just killing zombies and surviving what crap it did have its small moments the walk to the shop by pegg and the plans to get to the winchester over and over i still found the worst part was having to see a decent comedian like dylan moran being ripped apart yes it was fake yes he isnt really dead but this film is not a comedy it sucks edgar wright is lucky he made hot fuzz a masterpiece but should be a reminder of how not to make a film no film can be a horrorcomedy gore removes the jokes leaving a mass of blood and death wright should be ashamed,black_comedy
a friend of mine recommended this film to me as imdb rated it at 7 so i went to see it which was the worst mistake i could possibly make although i appreciate british humour this film just did not do it for memaybe it was the audience that was laughing hilariously at every scene or maybe the film was just plain bad it even got up to a point where i left the theatre to make a call when i got back 5 minutes later i did not even feel like i missed a part of the filmthe only good thing was the way the camera moved around shaun on his way to the grocery store that was brilliant however not brilliant enough to push this film above a horrid 1,black_comedy
i saw this movie expecting a comedy i did not get one i am usually good with switching genre midmovie but those movies at least had something that was supposed to be funny which part aside from the opening lines is supposed to be funny here the part when he needs to kill a family member the part where a man is ripped apart and his legs are then used as weapons if you thought this movie was funny you deserve to rot in hell i understand that there were some british jokes and i understood and was entertained by them for a few seconds then those dear to shaun are brutally killed and its apparently supposed to be funny if you have not seen this get on your knees and thank whatever god you worship if you were as unfortunate as me and wasted money on this i relate if you are someone who thought this movie was funny ive already told you where to go,black_comedy
edgar wrights smash hit self proclaimed romzomcom is set in england during the midst of the zombie outbreak during which fumbling shaun and company decide to wait the horrors out at a local pub and decide to let things sort themselves out over a nice cool pintsurprisingly the film actually has a solid sense of motivation shaun is really just the wrong guy at the wrong place at the wrong time while he is still horrified he decides it is just what he needs to prove his worth to ex liz as a huge horror fan myself i was laughing like crazy in the film everyone is fleshed out as dimensional characters who youre actually kind of sad to see die and trust me when i say that people die hard in this movieas they come is an amazing horror comedy its editing is fast and swift the direction is a complement to the very foundation of film its hard not to say you should totally buy it on bluray,black_comedy
spoilers hereinmovies are nearly always about other movies and heres a great examplein this great piece of writing we have explicit nods to three layered worlds theres the world of the viewer from which the simple artifacts of troubled relationships are drawn at a rather precise rhythm this is brought to the front no matter what else happensthen theres the layer of the pubgoers shaun and girlfriend and under that is the world of the zombies teds law is that when you have a film within a film the abstract distance between the first and second is exactly the same as between the second and third the film starts with liz telling her boyfriend that she doesnt want to be with him any more because she is afraid she will become a zombie the boyfriend goes around the room and takes apparent zombies and makes up a film for each one gangsters porn and so onthen we fall into a movie within the movie as effortlessly as an unwanted even disturbing song comes up on the jukebox it all centers on whether the pub is the place for zombies or nonzombies every action every scene is drawn from prior films and not always straight horror filmsa dog can only look down the levels never up except maybe in the end our hero has avoided the pub zombie disease his buddy has not which means he is pretty much at the end as he is in the beginningstacy schoolgirl zombies is another more obvious exampleteds evaluation  2 of 3 has some interesting elements,black_comedy
im really very anxious to know how this got good reviews i didnt find this movie remotely entertaining and would have shut it off immediately if i had control of the television at the time this was an awful movie i can appreciate the idea of a spoof on zombie films but at least do it properly the attempts at ironic humor and sarcasm were very dry and weak it was neither laugh worthy nor relatively clever i wasnt too fond of the acting or the use of a queen song in the soundtrack queen is one of the greatest rock bands of all time please do not defile their music by featuring it in something as awful as this all in all i thought this film was very stupid if you are looking for a horror movie spoof i highly recommend army of darkness but dont bother with,black_comedy
having consumed our 2nd jar of quality street this festive season my girlfriend and i decided to venture out to the pictures to enjoy what promised to be a movie with a difference   which spoke boldly of being a romantic comedywith zombies sadlythis title is somewhat misleading inasmuch as there is littleif anydiscernible romanceno comedy value of any descriptionand the implication that there may be some horror content is surely just a comment on the witless plotwooden acting and utter pointlessness of this whole sorry debacle this film has im afraid got as much going for it as simon peggs previous masterpiecethe parole officerand will sink without trace only to be found in blockbusters bargain bin 6 months or so from now shame on the cast for even agreeing to appear in this shambling drivel do yourselves a favour  avoidor leave the theatre looking and feeling like a zombieyou have been warned,black_comedy
this movie was such complete garbage that it wasnt even worth the electricity i paid to view it this movie stuns me that it even made it to the box office or for that matter even had a 30 second commercial to advertise iti think half of the people on this website voting this movie an 8 or a 7 are out of their mindsi rate this movie a 1 for awful but if it were my choice i would give it less than that say maybe a 079this movie definitely tries too hard to be like scary movie,black_comedy
something told me from the first time i saw the trailer that i was going to love this movie im glad that i can trust my instincts because rocked hard this has to be without a doubt the best movie of its kind since peter jacksons dead alive and its one of the funniest movies i saw all yearthe plot is simple shaun is a guy not much different from me who works a droning job spends most of his free time with his roommate ed playing video games and downing beer after beer at the local pub in fact when we first meet him hes being dumped by his girlfriend liz who is tired of the same old routine yeah it takes a while for the zombie action to kick in but i was having such a good time with shaun and ed i really didnt care the dialog is so wellwritten and the chemistry between the two are so good i wouldve been satisfied had this been a straight comedy without zombies anyway on a very bad hangover shaun slowly and i do mean slowly begins to realize that all is not well in london he finally puts it all together when a girl shows up in the backyard falls on a pipe which impales her then gets up and proceeds to attack after watching the news the two slowly begin to realize that people are starting to turn into zombies and eat each other in what is probably my favorite scene the two devise a plan to escape their house pick up shauns mother kill phil shauns stepfather because hes been bitten pick up liz then find a nice safe place to hide out and wait for things to cool down the way that the whole thing is shown is flatout brilliant and if something of its kind has been filmed before then im just unaware love that sequencei cant begin to count the reasons why i loved this movie the acting was topnotch the dialog will have you quoting for years to come the directing was brilliant and then theres the zombies and the gorelets just say that had one of the most gruesome death scenes ive ever witnessed in any movie ever all in all this movie is flawlesson a side note i watched this movie once and was able to remember all of the characters names without having to go back and double check myself taking my shortterm almost nonexistent memory into consideration thats really saying something,black_comedy
for some reason it is rated high but this film is low i just cant get it how could people rate it so high this one of the crappiest movies ive ever seen its stupid and its bad its supposed to be a funny horror movie well its not funny and its not scary its yet another of those boring movies you usually encounter while zapping into some accidental channel on your hotels tv in a foreign country where you dont yet know the channelsif you start watching it and think to yourself hmm thats quite bad then dont expect it to get better later on it doesnt it stays just as bad save yourself the timeavoid110,black_comedy
hi everyone im french and i like movies a lot i watch like at least a movie per day i watched last night with two of my friends and we thought the jokes were ridiculous and we would all give this film a 25 i wont develop on how bad the acting is etc but i just want to know what did we miss for example i read that phillips speech was very moving and i hope it was sarcasm the point is so far i trusted imdb a lot imdb was my reference and when a film had more than 75 i knew it was going to be good and now my friends make fun of me because of this film i made them see because it was high rated im very frustrated are there other people who felt the same way ps dont tell me i dont get british humor im fan of monthy python and i like it when people go crazy doing weird stuff and abstract jokes but sorry nothing like this in,black_comedy

a great idea  to sendup zombie movies  just doesnt hold up btw before i get going i havent ever had an opportunity to watch spaced so it could be that some of the problems i found are because the injokes are lost on me but even soi loved the beginning of this movie  the ignored snatches of newscasts the slowly building feeling of things getting out of control all done very cleverly the zday scene in the snackshop was great it seemed to me though that the writer and directory kind of ran out of creative steam and became more interested in little vignettes at the expense of the general narrative most specifically once the escape to the pub begins characters seemed alternatively oblivious to their situation and sharply aware of it for instance collecting weapons then abandoning them  but not replacing them so that after laying about with all sorts of useful implements they spend vast amounts of time getting to the pub and inside of it totally unarmed despite repeated opportunities this takes farce into the realm of ridiculousness as characters spend apparently endless time doing suicidally dumb things like arguing answering phones etc while the zombies take five or something theres a line of farce just like there is a line of suspension of disbelief  disbelief doesnt apply here but once you cross the line of farce the audience or at least me wont pay attention to the attempts at humor any more the viewer gives up as i did and so i couldnt enjoy the second half of the moviea shame really shawn had a lot of potential if the wit of the first half had extended to whole thing it would have been quite a gem it could have been up on the level of the evil dead series but i think it missed the mark rather widely,black_comedy
reading the good reviews and honestly i dont get how its an 8 did i completely miss the brilliant storyline with the well thought out ending i mean i read a lot of reviews and normally disagree with the bad reviews and i am sure that many will probably disagree with this but i love a good comedy movie what i love even more is a good zombie movie so i thought this was a no brainer all i can say now is wow it was terrible i dont think i laughed or even smiled once i think if i could id grab the gun and shoot myself first i hated it because i felt like the dramatic scenes if you have seen it i think you spend at least 30minutes of him saying its his mum and he cant shoot his mum i am not sure in what world these pro longed dramatic scenes are meant to be funny but it was like a really terrible soap opera that never endedi dont think i can think of anything positive to say about this movie sadly the acting by simon pegg i felt was fake the lack of common sense i guess some may find funny but i find completely stupidanyway i guess this movie was made in a time before great zombie films like the walking dead like world war z and plenty of other movies released after this if you are reading this and are a fan of the zombie genre i sincerely hope you skip this movie,black_comedy
beats me the wittier and more intelligent british comedy in years what was the dvds cover said ha ha i fell for itthis film is absolute crap and i dont recommend to watch it not even to my worst enemy i hope he saw it though please if you havent seen it stay away from this  you will thank mebad acting worse lines stupid plot was there a plot im aware this  was a parody but come on there was no irony humor witticism nothing which could save this stupid moviebelieve it or not i felt so dirty after watching this poor excuse of a film that i had to bathe myself after the endi promise i wont see a british so called comedy again ever i feel sorry sad and pathetic for wasting that time watching this  do you see a pattern about the grayed four letters word well that is because sofd is a total complete ,black_comedy
is a cheap and cheerful zombie brit flick with the accent firmly on cheapit looks and feels as if it was hastily conceived by a group of six form students on a media studies field trip more akin to carry on screaming than an american werewolf in londonwhich is a shame really because the horror genre has plenty of comic mileage left in it  if you can get the balance rightand thats another thing is it obligatory these days for british film directors to include at least one or in this instance two unemployed actors from tvs the office ok it was a very funny series while it lasted but its been flogged to death and im bored with it nowlets face it lucy davis was hardly a barrell of laughs in this film was she,black_comedy
i am a huge fan of gar and his dead movies and i have seen the previews stories and reviews for this movie and really wanted to see it and like it sadly i did not and neither did the people who were with me that wanted to see it more then i did some of the audience found it hysterical but walking out i heard a lot of i cant believe we drove over an hour to see this it was horrible however while i did not like the movie all that well it was not disposable either it was mildly funny but i could have waited for it to hit dvd i guess to each is their own but this movie did not deliver all the fun i thought it would have but if you want to see it make sure to check it out for yourself as you may like it better3 out of 10,black_comedy
this was easily one of the absolute worst movies i have ever seen it was supposed to be funny  well it wasnt funny in the least actually what i found hilarious was the fact that i lost 90ish minutes of my life watching this movie i have seen some bad movies in my day and most of the time i can find something to appreciate about them has no redeeming value to it whatsoever i had wanted to root for his character until i realized that he wrote the script i heard a fourletter c word one too many times to tolerate and found that british humor is incredibly offensive  if this is in fact british humor think its because im a girl my fianc who loves toilet humor and parodies begged me to turn it off he said it was worse than having his nose hairs ripped out with a tweezers then having lemon juice poured up his nose thats pretty bad it was simply the most overrated pile of rubbish i have ever seen i do not recommend it and i sincerely hope that the writer seriously considers a new career,black_comedy
good comedy is hard to do because some people think good comedy would be a joke that is built up until it is finally done while others think good comedy is a loud noise like a fart or someone screaming random nonsense its hard to make comedy that will stay funny but thats exactly what does it stays funny after i watch it multiple times on many viewings it was funnier than i remember it being from the previous viewing but its not just great comedy that holds this movie up as my favorite comedythe story is about a man named shaun he cant keep his life sorted out he makes promises to his girlfriend liz that he cant keep all the while a zombie apocalypse has just broken out and he and his best friend ed have to survive the apocalypse and save shauns mom liz and her friendsi love the story of this movie edgar wright made a movie that is a funny parody of zombie movies but is also a good romantic comedyzombie movie alone all of the characters have amazing chemistry with each other shaun and ed act just like real best friends mainly because they are best friends in real life shaun and liz do great at acting like a relationship that is falling apart and building back up again near the end lizs friends dianne and david are completely opposite characters dianne is nice and friendly as best as she can to shaun while david strongly dislikes to even hating shaun for his actions and mistakes throughout the movie every character here stands out from each otherthe movie is also really well made technically to think that they were able to get so many extras to play as the zombies near the final act is impressive to me and the lighting camera work and editing is great theres very little cgi in the movie but the cgi in the movie holds up a little some of the cgi hasnt aged amazing well but it didnt bother me that muchthis is as ive already said several times my favorite comedy of all time and it remains in my top 5 favorite movies of all time list its smart its creative its fun its funny it is a masterpiece i will always love this movie,black_comedy
the movie tells a story of a man with his friends escape from the zombiesi ike this story because the movie is new for mei didnt seen any kind of this a comedy mix with horror creates a lot of fun secondly the films background zombies didnt nervous the hero and theb music is always ridiculous at last hte ending is fun that ed didn dead,black_comedy
the fact that has gone largely unnoticed by the masses is the biggest sin in the world of cinema to this day is renowned director edgar wrights best film to date  his passion of storytelling intricate detailing exciting direction character building world building everything is at its most apparent herei think ive seen more than any other movie and i still find things in it that i failed to see on the other viewings every time edgar wright and simon peggs screenplay is nothing short of masterful and quite simply one of the best screenplays of all time nearly every line of dialogue every shot every action acts as foreshadowing or as part of a beforeafter structure that shows character growth and story progression every second of film here is put to good use and there isnt a hair or screentime you could remove  everything is made integral in the most tightnit story ive seen to this day edgar wrights direction makes everything fun and entertaining from his visual comedy to adding flare to the most mundane tasks such as making toast and teanot to mention every character is superbly written to be consistent and show growth or provide the tools for growth in the other characters shaun has to be in my top 50 protagonists of all time for being incredibly relateable likeable and proactive even while being an everyman the performances help so much too with nick frost being the standout as he makes a character that could easily be annoying if not played right a charming and hilarious addition to the cast these arent your usual zombie movie stereotypes there are characters the film makes you care and root forspeaking of the zombie genre i believe this film is the best example of how to do a spoof of a genre as while conventions are somewhat mocked and poked fun at the story is still intense the characters are human beings and not over the top caricatures and most of all the threat is still very real  i first saw this film when i was 7 and some of the zombie moments haunted me for a couple years before i was brave enough to watch it againcharming indescribably clever and just simply a masterpiece  edgar wright and simon pegg deserve all the oscars for this triumph of film,black_comedy
ordinary man whose life is falling apart experiences zombie apocalypse and gets a chance to redeem himself good well written and masterfully acted characters critique of modern way of life great pop cultural references puns and a sense for style you heard it all if you havent go watch it and realize im telling you the truth its really good i have a few minor complaints here and there but its nothing that can really make this movie bad 910 from me and a warm recommendation,black_comedy
as a hardcore zombiefan i can honestly rate this as one of the best,black_comedy
cool movie i watched back when i was in middle school from what i remember the humor was rather witty the acting was good it had a really heartbreaking moment that i wont say to prevent spoilers and it had a charm to it that i usually feel watching movies from the uk overall a decent experience and nice movie to watch,black_comedy
there is a reason why after 15 years this film still has a high rating and is still a fond favourite of mine to watchthe beginning of the cornetto trilogy not including spaced goes off with a bang edgar wright simon pegg and nick frost delivers a fun packed action zombie thrillerwe are introduced to shaun pegg looking animated in a pub whilst being spoken at by liz kate ashfield about their sinking relationship ed frost is introduced whilst playing a slot machine he is overweight dirty and foul mouthed a bit of a stereotype which has me laughing from the start a series of events with shaun failing lizs needs and being obsessed with the winchester pub sees him being dumped and then to make matters worse the zombie apocalypse arriveswith ed in tow shauns plan is to take car go to mums kill phil grab liz go to the winchester have a nice cold pint and wait for all of this to blow over a perfect plan in shauns eyes but then that wouldnt make a film if all plans went accordinglywith a british star studded cast of bill nighy peter seraginowicz lucy davis dylan moran penelope wilton martin freeman and many more it is no wonder why this comedy has become a cult classic and possible the best zombie film unintentionally out therementions also must be made to all behind the scenes too with a limited budget wright has created a masterpiece for those more into the cornetto universe then keeping an eye out to all nods of pervious enterprises and future is a must especially when seeing tyres from spaces as a zombie in the crowdi will forever live this film and glad it has become the classic that it is,black_comedy
although not inaccurately billed as a romantic comedy with zombies is at its heart a horror film with the same underlying hopelessness that typifies the zombie movie genre to stave off some of this inevitable darkness this well constructed very funny film features not only a witty script full of clever parallels and outrageous situations but also plenty of over the top implausible gore,black_comedy
i am a zombie moviebook lover big time if you want to have some true belly laughs i suggest you watch this movie,black_comedy
simon pegg and nick frost is hillarious this zombie movie is stupidly unexplainably funny just funny funny funny crazy crazy crazy nuts,black_comedy
slackjawed vacant stare lurching staggering gait  im not talking about the zombies in im talking about some of the people i saw after i left the theatreis not scary whats scary is that there are people out there around us among us who live as though they were zombies people for whom life is never anything more than working 9 to 5 in a deadend job then coming home to spend the evening as couch potatoes in front of the tv or video games people with no soul or spirituality people for whom there is no heaven or hell no thought of survival after death people for whom mere survival in life is about as much as they can handlepeople of whom john cougar mellencamp sang oh yeah life goes on long after the thrill of living is goneas it turns out the zombies in are creatures of habit they may be braindead but they can perform menial mindless mechanical tasks  just like any real live workingclass stiffi was led to believe that was a satire on the modern british middle class ghoul britannia so to speak bangers and monster mashbut is universal in its import a comedy with a tragic message and the message is this the greatest thing modern man has to fear is not death it is life in death,black_comedy
the department store salesman shaun simon pegg is a real loser having a routine life that is bothering his girlfriend liz kate ashfield every night they go to the pub winchester with shauns best friend the moron edward nick frost and lizs friends dianne lucy david and david dylam moran shaun and ed share a house with pete peter serafinowicz who hates ed when a satellite returning to earth has some problems over london the dead return to life and eat human flesh of those alive shaun plots a plan to rescue his mother and liz and bring them to the winchester but his sanctuary is surrounded of zombies and things do not happen as plannedis a funny parody of the night of the living dead with potential of cultmovie the story has a british humor and some situations are really funny since the two heroes are authentic morons that recall beavis and butthead or even the lazy characters of idle hands this film is recommended for specific audiences that liked the black humor of braindead frankenhooker or idle hands just to mention some examples the news on tv in the end of the story is hilarious my vote is seventitle brazil todo mundo quase morto everybody almost deadnote on 05 february 2012 i saw this film again,black_comedy
watched it again last night on one of the pay channels starz and was in stitches throughout i have it on dvd and no matter what when it comes on if i am around the tv that is what i am watching this is one of the best  horror movies i have ever seen and i have seen my fair share from good horror movies the thing the original night of the living dead to really really bad ones too many to name being from the south in the united states  typically southerners arent expected to get british humor but i am not like my fellow southerners please understand that this is not a dig at my fellow countrymen but at the sense of humor in this country in general i latched onto this movie the very first time i saw it and immediately got all the jokes from beginning to end blame monty python fawlty towers and benny hill all that being said if you havent seen this masterpiece you need too if you enjoy horror movies zombie movies andor british humor then this is a must see,black_comedy
this film was boring its an hours and half full of nothing this script could have been done in 30 minutes its not a film that will make you laugh never they made a big film with very little content and really lacks creativity im sorry i wouldnt recommend it to anybody,black_comedy
it was awful to watch not funny not interesting not good it was bad as hell please give me back 50 minutes of my life god how can someone would like this movie it was bad from the start and i didnt even finish it it was horrible please dont even try you will lose your time go watch another movie i cant believe the reviews saying that this was good cause it wasnt i really love zombie movies but this is just horrible the jokes were awful the situations were obvious and very predictable and the story itself was really bad and stupid the end is even worst i think this is the worst zombie movie ive seen this year dont waste your time watching this and dont let them make you think this is good please take my advice keep yourself away from this thingby the way i didnt laugh not even once,black_comedy
well people who would have rated this this movie must be either in very good mood or very high on drugs the first 1015 minutes was good sensible comedy then the movie went down exponentially to total disgusting and nonhumorous stupidity some of the stupid scene really bored and angered me so much that i would have wished the zombies would have bashed the brains of the characters for lame acting and immense lack of intelligence also there is lot of bloodshed and gore which is not funny for zombie related movies better to watch other comedy movies from the same lead actors ho fz 2007 if you want to really know the difference between comedy and stupidity,black_comedy
this movie is by far one of the best movies i have ever seen it is quite hilarious the movie is somewhat sad scary and funny at the same time simon pegg and nick frost are hilarious and i truly cant waite for a sequel hot fuzz anyways this movie is a piece of art in my opinion the british can truly make great comedy this movie has won a spot on my top 100 list no doubt heck i bet it made my top 10 list of favorite movies its truly one of the best and im sure many to come will find this movie to be one of the greatest movies if you have not seen this movie yet i suggest you do its a great movie and every fan of comedy should have it in their collection,black_comedy
isnt a spoof of the zombie genre it just isnt the same sort of film as scary movie or even in a sense pegg and wrights later effort hot fuzz its a darker sort of satire not light hearted and at points it is a reasonably effective drama surprisingly its actually a bit scarier than your average modern zombie film because it takes the time to develop its characters and make you feel for them the screenplay is actually human and smart instead of just being a loosely connected series of gore scenes zombie films are and have been for over 25 years now for the most part simply meaningless gore scenes attached to each other remember when romero was out making films that genuinely horrified you remember how terrifying even the dated night of the living dead still is and how its sequel dawn of the dead was a wonderful edgy satire with some truly horrific moments sadly those movies just arent around any more with the exception of a couple of gems like 28 days later zombie movies are now nothing more than extremely violent action films with a slightly supernatural feelits a simple movie really peggs character shaun has lost his girlfriend and realizes that his life is going the wrong way so he vows to get his girlfriend back unfortunately the day he does this is the day when london becomes populated by the living dead but shaun soldiers on regardless armed with only a cricket bat attempting to save his family and friends the film doesnt work as well for someone who is unfamiliar with the sort of film that shaun is simultaneously making fun of and paying tribute to because it is after all a fan film jampacked with references to other films both in the script and visuals the zooming and quick cutting is directly taken from raimis latter two evil dead movies it helps if the viewer is familiar with those filmsat times during one forgets theyre watching a comedy and feels genuine horror and sadness there are only two or three extremely violent scenes but the sense of dread particularly when combined with the generally fun mood of the film is effective and when major characters die you actually do feel a bit sorry for them which is a lot more than i can say about most zombie movies that have been made recently the script doesnt focus on making fun of the zombie genre or more specifically dawn of the dead instead opting to create both an effective satire on the zombie genre and on our society much like dawn of the dead did in 1978 of course shaun is a lot funnier and much less gruesome than that film but they are so similar in the sense that they were more about people and society than about zombies zombies themselves are hardly the most intriguing creatures theyre dumb and slow and really not all that menacing they lack the creepy sophisticated cruelty of vampires or the pure cruelty of regular human villainsedgar wrights direction is superb and the scene with the zombie in the pub involving queens dont stop me now is both an excellent bit of comedy and an involving piece of cinema wellstaged wellshot and wellacted the last half hour of the film is less lighthearted and more serious than the rest of the film and includes some genuinely dramatic moments it is not my intention to make sound less funny than it is but it is absolutely unequivocally necessary to point out that this is hardly just a random spoof of the zombie genre it does mock the genre in areas but it is more of a loving tribute to the genre films of past than a heartless spoof of them which makes it in a sense similar to young frankenstein shaun is also a brilliant satire on society much like the best of zombie films actually is truly one of the greatest zombie films ever made and an instant classic810,black_comedy
well im not sure what everybody saw in this movie i borrowed it from a friend and he said oh man this is like my favorite movie all time and i watched it and i didnt even know what to think i couldnt tell if it was trying to be like a big joke some kind of parody or if it was trying to be serious he starts off by beating zombie people with a cricket mallet or whatever you want to call it and then it turns more serious and his mom gets infected and he is forced to shoot her and then at the end his best friend who is a zombie is locked away in his shed to be friends i really couldnt find the main idea of the movie but i guess its appealing to some people but if your looking for some kind of actiongore movie id rather get lord of the rings or gladiator,black_comedy
 simon pegg nick frost kate ashfield lucy davis dylan moran nicola cunningham peter serafinowicz directed by edgar wrightthe movie written by the director edgar wright and actor simon pegg whom also plays shaun in the movie make a hilarious observation on what is an apocalyptic nightmare shaun pegg is an over worked lackey whos love life with his girlfriend liz ashfield is dying on its feet in his last fleeting attempt to please her he only makes it worse shaun now suffering the heartbreak in the company of his bumbling sidekick ed frost is soon shocked when the recently deceased come back to life wright and pegg make what seems to be an over indulged film genre back to life and one of the best zombie movies out there my final rating 1010,black_comedy
british humor how i love it is full of it let me make clear right at the beginning that this movie can also be watched by people who are not into zombie and horror flicks at all this is a mixture of almost every genre you can imagine theres a little bit of drama a little bit of romance some horror and as i said lots of humor its easy to tell that the people behind this project have a great love for the zombie genre what separates them from geeks like peter jackson is that they dont live exclusively in their fantasy world but that they have a sharp eye for peoples motivations and their way of dealing with everyday problems where dead alive bad taste and even evil dead 2 drew their laughs from extensive use of blood guts and overthetop violence is funny because of its debunking look at the lives of average joes somehow the movie follows the tradition of romeros flicks by unmasking peoples weaknesses but it does that in a much warmer and  again  humorous wayshaun is one of us an everyday guy who has everyday problems and keeps having them even in the most bizarre situations simon pegg nails the character he creates a new antihero  la ash without being a pale ripoff of that character each cast member has amazing timing and knows how to bring the humor of the script to lifethe only little beef i have with is that it gets a little too serious in the end which is a little inappropriate considering for the rest of the time the viewer plies between grinning incessantly and roaring with laughteranyway is an instant cult classic and will gain a huge fanbase it was about time someone took the throne of sam raimi and bruce campbell edgar wright and simon pegg are definitely worthy of that legacy,black_comedy
since everyone in the world here has seen fit to describe the plot of this movie in excruciating detail ill skip all that and just let you know that this was the funniest movie ive seen in a long time the understated bemused reactions of shaun and ed to all thats going on around them at first are they out there nooh wait there they are sets the stage for lifeanddeath struggle against the undead oras they will be known in reality tvthe fun dead that will forever be remembered as zday there is no subtlety herethe zombies are everywhere and the noise is constant which is one thing i might have changed it gets quite tiring to watch all this activity over fully the last half of the film still its hilarious without being meanspirited even though folks being are being gobbled up and ripped apart throughout who needs a superhero to save the world when weve got shaun,black_comedy
my cousin had called me from london a few months ago and told me about this film she also asked if there were any trailers or release dates in the states i didnt know i never even heard of the film but it sounded hysterical i did see the theatrical trailer a week later but i was saddened that there was no theater around that was playing this flick finally it came out for rent and i grabbed it immediately im glad i did the things that got me about this movie is that it reminds me so much of my friends if there is a huge crisis im so much like ed im just calm and with whatever goes and my best friend is so much like shaun its scary how her and i could relate these boys are so hung over from the night before and their reaction the first zombie in shauns backyard is priceless oh my god shes so drunk and ed getting a picture when she attacks shaun because he thinks that shes just hitting on him lol the references to past zombie movies were great were coming to get you barbara priceless i love this movie a lotthis movie is so funny even though dawn of the dead2004 was a great movie this movie brings up all the sarcasms of the original along with any other zombie movie i would highly recommend this movie for a good laugh the ending is the best part and highly touching dont ask good job uk 1010,black_comedy
this film is meant to be a comedy well the dawn of the dead remake had more funny moments i probably would have enjoyed this film more had the auditorium not been filled with loudmouthed chuckleheads determined to shriek with laughter at every oneliner expletive or bit of gore that crossed the screen as though what they were seeing was fresh and witty and in no way done before the plot was formulaic and the jokes dull the only things worth another look were the acting and the makeup which were both passable at best this is very much aimed at the teen market and the townie crowd who are easily entertained if you want something more challenging and funny to watch go and stare at a clown with a knife in its back definately not worth 550 of my hard earned dollars,black_comedy
people loved it critics loved it people who make movies loved itand i really dont get itthe makers obviously do have some interest in zombie films and from interviews appear to have great affection for them yet the film came off as sneering gigglingzombie films themselves have never had pretencions of their own importance even a film such as dawn of the dead which has great social commentary has moments that make you giggle at the absurdity of it has few ideas really how to mock this genre because once it gets past the fact that oh look arent they slow we descend into serious momentbroken by the fat guyserious momentbroken by the fat guy and it isnt good enoughtheir is a cheap survivor gets bitten moment tagged on for good measure but it is forced if you want to subvert the genre have the lead guy bitten or the girl the rest has been done beforea lot may hinge on whether you like simon pegg and nick frost or whether you have seen enough zombie films to realise that what theyre doing isnt as innovative as other reviewers would have you believe,black_comedy
im not from the uk live in nj and not a fan of horror movies but i enjoyed thoroughly i first saw it on dvd and watched it twice plus all the additional material which is rare for me im sure that a few jokes were missed on me for example i only found out about the original dawn of the dead a few weeks after ive watched it but the greatness of the movie lies not in any oneliners or comedic material movies that rely on this are rarely enjoyable when viewed more than once no this movie belong to the same category as spinal tap its appeal is in the offthewall characters and situations and in the absurdity of itand this in a nutshell is what this movie is a theater of the absurd you have people who desperately try to maintain a normal lifestyle while all around them is chaos who try to patch up relationships while being attacked by flesheating zombies in one of the best scenes the main character shaun has his first hearttoheart talk with his stepfather of 20 years just as the old man turns into a zombie in another shaun tries to prevent his best friend ed from throwing an acdc record at a zombie in self defense because it is a first edition and not to mention the laidback ed himself who decides to take a call on his cellphone just when it is imperative that he pretends to be a zombie to avoid being attacked by their kindbut the movie isnt just a mindless comedy theres good directing and acting and the timing and pace are excellent throughout most of it the plot is very strong and even the tv broadcasts which are intertwined with the movie are entertaining one word of advice though dont show this to small kids while less terrifying than your average horror movie there are still some gory scenes,black_comedy
so what would happen if you replaced the hero of a zombie movie with a bubbling slacker well if you are british you get the movie starts out following shaun around his mundane life hes still working at a computer store he still sits in front of the tv flipping channels with his buddy ed who is a bigger loser than shaun is but his world comes crashing down when his girlfriend dumps him oh and the whole city is being turned into zombies not that shaun or ed even notice thats until ed notices a weird girl hanging out in their garden this gives shaun the idea on how to get his girlfriend back sweep her off her feet and take her to safety but shaun and ed are no will smith and bruce willis so hilarity ensuesthe major problem with the movie is that their too many spots in the movie where the scenes are not funny or scary with a movie that mixes humor with gore there should be a least one going on at all time another problem with the movie is that there is some things that are lost in the translation as it is a british film while i was watching it i wondered out load why would shaun have a paddle in his shed and why would he grab that someone then pointed out that it was a cricket bat and there were a few places where the british slang just went over of my headthe dvd extras include the usual trailer documentaries extremely boring deleted and extended scenes good choice taking these out and blooper reel one very inventive feature was the inclusion of comics that plugs so holes in the story no if only every movie did this also during the film shaun and ed flip through the tv pretty quickly so in the extra they show extended versions of what they flipped past including a interview with coldplay who lost some of their members to the zombies and what looks to be the british version of jerry springerwith everything that had be popular oversees i predicted we will get an americanized version of spelled shawn insteadwithin five years with stifler as shawn jack black as ed kate bosworth as liz the nerdy dude from the oc as david some token hot chick as dianne and burt reynolds as phillip and in hopes to rejuvenate his career michael jackson will don the thriller makeup one more time to be the head zombie that leads the other zombie in a zombie dance just make sure shawn grabs a baseball bat out of the shed,black_comedy
many have excessively praised this movie but this boat left me on the shore wondering what id missed yes this film had its moments of hilarity but overall it had the look feel storyline  passable script of a made for tv zombie comedy  which dragged on the movie could have been reduced to a very funny 45 minute sketch as part of a general comedy show my girlfriend even fell asleep half way though it by no means is it the masterpiece of comedy which many are touting  i suspect its one of those cult films which every one and their dog simply has to like to be part of the cool crowd talk of a sequel yawn of the dead,black_comedy
this is a fail movie too slow shaun needed processing time every time someone from his gang got bit guess the story writer and director added the so called crying moments to stretch the movie duration to charge us for sitting in the movie theater 1 star bcz 0 is not allowed,black_comedy
okay what if you woke up one day and discovered that everything was pretty much the same except now there are fleshcrazed zombies out there trying to eat you what would you do well for shaun simon pegg he plans to 1 save his girlfriend liz 2 save his mum barbara 3 go to his favorite pub the winchester and 4 wait for everything to blow over however things dont go as planned because watch the show this movie almost singlehandedly launched simon peggs career and justifiably so in theres a plethora of memorable oneliners quirky characters and yes gentle bloodthirsty viewer a healthy smattering of bloody zombie action though the emphasis is more on laughs than chills this zomedy or zomcom will leave you rolling in the aisles,black_comedy
perfectly mixes buddy comedy parody horror romantic love triangles touching heart and frankly awesome gory action to create one of the best films of all time edgar wright and simon pegg have delivered a clever script that goes along perfectly with great performances that warrant multiple viewings a perfect score that incorporates some of the best songs ever into sequences that make you smile from ear to ear and wright and cos trademark sound effects are just a few of the things that work absolutely perfect and make for a great experience watch it once then watch it again then think about how much you like it and then watch it again,black_comedy
shaun shaun shaun a fantastic and funny movie british comedy mixed with a zombie attack with some heartsimon pegg and nick frost are hilarious together edgar wright did an amazing job and the tribute to dawn of the dead as well as other movies of the same genre is excellent full credit for taking a subject like zombies and making it more fun than it ever has been in the past from drinking and smoking in the neighbourhood pub to throwing vintage records at zombies heads its a fun ride with a reality base i mean how many zombie movies have people throwing wooden spoons at them to try to kill them the scenes with bill nighy are especially fun to watch credit to all involved for taking a broken love story and chucking in a bunch of dead people,black_comedy
shaun is a 29yearold with no real ambition in life much to the consternation of his friends family and fedup girlfriendwith only a loyalty to his lazy best friend ed a deadend job where his employees step on him and the goodol days shaun isnt exactly putting his best foot forwardbut when the undead start to rise in numbers around london shaun must come to the rescue of his girlfriend and mother before all hell breaks loosewith loyal ed at his side to fight the good fight the two will have to pave their way through zombieridden london as shaun must take on the first real challenge in his lifeits easily the high watermark of british comedy in absolutely ages and not only is this hilarious stuff its absolutely genius when referencing other movies and horror stars and directorspegg and wright have crafted that rare beast a comedy with some truly scary and heartbreaking momentseven though shaun is underachieving when we first meet him he has to cope with the many levels of loss in such a short time when the second act commences i know this is looking into it a little too deep but the man loses a lot and still manages to keep it together and if you have seen the film as many times as myself it becomes a major plot arc of the filmif you are a huge horror fan there are so many references to the genre as in forees electrics fulcis restaurant and obviously dawn of the deadpegg and frost are terrific as the arguing friends but ashfield moran and especially davis provide some very good supportits richly narrative and laugh out loud funny in many places and no matter how many times you watch it it feels a lot shorter than what it isa true masterpiece of film making,black_comedy
part 1 of the three flavours cornetto trilogy in the horror genre theres been a few good zombie comedies return of the living dead and army of darkness are probably the most famous titles to grave the genre is by the best zombie comedy since what makes the film so good is simon pegg and nick frosts antics on screen especially nick frost as ed he is just hilarious can easily be seen as the best zombie comedy since army of darkness and return of the living dead because the humour and horror elements are blended together very well to create a unique film with plenty of laugh yet enough horror elements to please the regular comedy viewer and the diehard zombie fan the script is very well crafted and the film is clever witty and over the top funny watching this film is a blast and will guarantee a great time shaun and ed are the main characters and they try to survive in a local pub during an apocalyptic zombie outbreak this film is a treasure and the cast does a phenomenal job with a terrific script and story simon pegg and nick frost are always a pleasure to watch on screen and proves it is a real treat to watch with family and friends and is a good film to watch during the halloween season many laughs and scares will abound in this latest zombie comedy genre and therefore is another addition to the very short list of the best zombie comedies ever made the film should appeal to every horror fan as this has all the elements of a good horror film and elements of a good comedy film edgar wright has done a marvelous job at crafting something great here and remains one of three most memorable british horror films definitely one of the best horror films in the last ten years sam raimi and dan obannon would be proud considering that this film has george a romeros stamp of approval it should be enough for you to give this a look if you still havent its a 10 star zombie masterpiece,black_comedy
i love this film it is one of my favourite films of all time ive watched this film a lot of times and im still not bored of it for zombie film fans like my self  this film is full to the brim of references to so many amazing zombie film  wick makes it even more enjoyable it is in my opinion to spite what the haters say is very well scripted the acting is excellent the editing is spectacular and its laugh out loud funny this also has elements of a romcom too giving the film a perfect balance of horror comedy and romance making it a good allround filmthe two main actors work well together simon pegg  nick frost are an extremely funny comedy duo the film is directed by one of my favourite directors edgar wright who has worked with pegg and frost many times now on thing like the tv show spaced and the film hot fuzz witch i also lovethe only negative thing i would say is that some of its brilliance mite be lost for people who dont get the references but do not lit that stop you it is even with a lack of prior knowledge is a great film also this is a cult film so this would be to be expected worth a watch if you love classic zombie films or not 10 out of 10,black_comedy
what to say about this movie is one of the funniest comedies if not one of the funniest movies i have seen in such a long time what makes this movie different from other films in its genre is that their are zombies added to the mix i especially like the way the characters behave when they are trying to figure out how they are going to survive while their home city is infested with zombies the acting special effects and makeup is just brilliant simon pegg really knows how to act and he plays his role very well and with a lot of conviction i like how his character is portrayed as a slacker and a very unreliable person namely to his girlfriend who dumps him as a result and gets his but off the couch and tries to save his friends from a zombie apocalypse is a fun movie,black_comedy
if this were an american filmi might not have liked it as much so it was natural that it was a british filmfollows the story of a man named shaunsimon pegg who is your typical loser whos life is going nowhereparallel to thata plague is happening and it turns a lot of people into zombies and shaun has to deal with his own problems and the zombie one at the same timethe film boasts a humorous support cast including nick frostdylan moran and bill nighy among othersthe rest of the cast help set up simon pegg to be one of the best upcoming funny men around which in my view is pivotal to this films successon another good noteit beats having to watch another annoying american comedy when there is one available in your own backyardto wrap it all upbloody fantastic,black_comedy
i hired this movie and now own when i heard my friends talking about it often for quite a while this movie is just brilliantshaun simon pegg is a guy with a lousy job shares a house with two friends ed who is an immature man who does not seem like he is ever going to grow up and has no job and pete who works and is absolutely fed up with edshaun has one last chance to make it up with his girlfriend liz kate ashfield because she is sick of having to go to the winchester pub every time they go on a date and she feels as though shaun is not being committed shaun ed liz and her two friends dianne and david lucy davis and dylan moran are always together when they go on these dates at the winchesterwell it doesnt work out with shaun and liz and they break up ed takes shaun to the winchester and this is when people start noticing some strange thingsthe next day the outbreak of zombies is revealed and shaun devises a plan to rescue his mum and kill his step dad bill nighy and rescue his new exgirlfriend liz and wait the zombie epidemic outthere are a lot of funny scenes in this movie i am not even really going to start because i wont stopthere are quite a few touching moments as well especially when shauns step dad apologises and another one later but i dont want to spoil itanyways this is a really funny movie and some of the gross gory bits are actually made funny because of the atmosphere created its a romantic comedy with zombies,black_comedy
there is so many great things you can say about this film is funny scary and at times heartbreaking the cast and director really played every angle perfectly they gave you characters you actually gave a damn about and a story that was entertainingi have truly never laughed so hard in my life and the comedic genius of both simon pegg and nick frost is outstanding not too mention how well they play off each other having been a fan of british comedy for 10 years i had always thought there would never be a film to come close to funny as holy grail now here we have and it is as funny if not funnier than any of the monty python stuff out therei will say i am ashamed to admit i just only recently watched this film and it was only because i found hot fuzz to be a really great film and the poster mentioned it was from the guys whom did well after seeing shaun i can safely say shaun is definitely the better of the two films but hot fuzz is very enjoyablei am not a spoiler type person but i highly suggest you check this film out and if you dont get any of the three emotions i mentioned above then you are a shutin whom should be banned from ever watching another film in the history of cinema,black_comedy
has a big problem the writers love their horror films sadly they love their horror films just a bit too much and spend most of it ripping ideas and scenes from flicks such as dawn of the dead and day of the dead and dropping in references to other characters and pictures as a result you end up with a very british hotpot of something 20 original 80 remakethe premise is good the acting is pretty decent and locations and sets are spot on but when everyone is called ash and shops are called landis and posters on the walls are japanese flicks you begin to grow tired of the cleverness of it all throw in a few spaced injokes for good measure and you have one of the most geeky monster films ever madethe good news is if you grow tired of spot the film reference you can always play spot the comedianrock star notveryfunny cameo game insteadi picked up the dvd of this expecting more instead i got in lesson in how to make 15yearold boys laugh using the cword in the first five minutes should have set the alarm bells ringingits okay if your drunk and eating a pizza but there are better movies around one of channel four on a sunday night,black_comedy
i first encountered simon pegg and edgar wright when a friend of mine introduced me to the english cultseries spaced its clear that these crazy fellows make movies just because they love it its the kind of ultrareferential metamanic intertextual stuff that any moviefanatic loves almost every scene is a reference to another movie and the real sport is guessing what movie it comes fromfollows the same tradition but with romeros dawn of the dead as their maininspiration anyone who tried to analyze romeros work should know that its not just about people coming back from the dead to eat the brains of the living its a critical comment to the modern zombieculture one sees when entering a shopping mall the zombies are consumers and the are uspegg and wright has certainly not abandoned this idea however the zombies are not just mallrats the zombies are lazy unemployed couchsitting playstationjunkies the zombies are our tvculture keeping the idealistic ideology add humour and a passion for movies  there you have is funny original interesting and quite gory its the best tribute to the zombiegenre ive ever seen,black_comedy
this is what the zombie movie genre should have been a comedy i really disliked the original dotd i can see that it started a trend but why is beyond me since its so appallingly bad not only is the setup a bit sillyslowmoving brainless easy to spot zombies taking over the world yeah right but the movie takes itself so seriously and the fans even more so doesnt and thats its strengththe movie starts as a normal relationship comedy and shaun is our regular loser the whole problem of the dead walking begins just as any problem something you hear on the news but ignore because you have worse problems peoples reactions to the zombie plague dont say the zword is actually pretty realistic and also funnythe movie uses gore in a good way and doesnt indulge in it like the 2004 dotd remake since this is not usa the londoners have to use cricket bats and umbrellas instead of shotguns and colts the classic mall is replaced with a pub and when shauns mum tells him shes been attacked on the phone she refers to the zombies as a tad bitey its very british and i love thatthe cast is good especially pegg who shows a great range o emotions the two usual zombie movie emotions fear and expressionlessness are nowhere to be seen the supporting cast is good and the zombie extras are greati recommend this movie to anyone who likes zombie movies and to other people too unless you have a weak stomach this movie is good for everyone,black_comedy
im tired of the crud hollywood puts out lately even the good stuff most of it looks promising but instead turns out to be uneven and lame leave it to the uk to bring us a smash hit zombie movie with brains and heart and blood to bootim not really the one to describe the plot of this movie being its been described countless of times in hundreds of critics reviews but lets just say this movie is what happens when you take an unsuccessful slackjawed employee from an electronics store barely hanging on to the life hes got left and throwing in an army of zombies what would you do if something like this happened to you wing it and make stuff up as you go along which is pretty much what the title character shaun doesive seen movies that i loved and said were my favorite only to change my mind the next time i saw another awesome movie i will never see a better movie than this everhas everything you could ask for in a movie its smart sharp funny brilliant touching disturbing gross and it leaves you with a feeling of knowing you just watched a movie that was worth your time if thats not worth something then i dont know what is,black_comedy
like a veritable color wheel of human emotions is a comedy that covers all the ground and then some i was simply stunned how moved i was by a movie that made me laugh this hard this is no overhyped special edition dvd movie the guy at blockbuster says changed film this film shoots neither over your head nor under it that isnt to say its lowbrow it is sublimely clever but it isnt smug and content with itself as a film and yet it doesnt desperately attempt to entertain it comes across not like watching jim carrey who always tries to be everything to his audience but instead is like bill cosby cosby could hold hundreds in an auditorium captive with laughter for hours and you might find yourself in a similar state after watching shaunam i overhyping this film what ive said above is like somebody saying mozart was just a musician the absolute greatness of this film cannot be overstated is it gory hell yes is it bleak at times is it britishstyle humor yes and with a u if you really want to be accurate this movie is everything it wants to be and more you may find yourself crying at this film you may find yourself laughing uncontrollably you may be frightened to your core it is really really really good best ever no but guaranteed not to disappoint1010 stars,black_comedy
30 years ago the first monty python movie appeared in cinemas and was one of the funniest british movies ever the group released 2 more films before stopping after graham chapman died so for more than 20 years britain has been waiting for a movie to revamp its comedy image and here it is this will be a short summary with some spoilers in firstly this film is brilliantly funny im 14 and understood all the jokes they come out at you when you least expect it almost like an episode of family guy secondly yes this film is gory spoiler but the only scene of a high nature is when david gets ripped limb from limb the homages are brilliant which is what you would expect comic genius and film fanatic simon pegg i cannot recommend this movie enough first there was night then dawn then day now there is shaun enjoy,black_comedy
this has to be a one off film as i dont think i have ever seen anything quite like it those expecting a spoof expect to be disappointed as this is a witty original comedythe idea for this movie was when simon pegg wondered what zombie films would have been had they been set in hackney and the results prove they would have been hilariousthe plot is simple shaun is a loser after losing his girlfriend the end of the world is nigh unless he can save them and kick some zombie butt the cast are all superb in this film as it wallows its way through london to try to get to the pubpegg is excellent as shaun our have a go hero yet he still kept most of the best lines for nick frost ed peggs real life best friend the other cast members all do great jobs too kate ashfield liz plays a straight role to a likable enough degree dylan moran david is excellent with his sht eating grin as liz dumps shaun lucy davies di also does a great job with you feeling such sympathy for her just for the look on the girls face last but not least bill nighy and penelope wilton are as excellent as ever as i think we all expect from them as shauns mom and step fatherthe film pays homage to lots of great horror films with slight references to everything from halloween to an american werewolf in london but what impressed me the most with this film was the way it stuck to the george romero zombie flicks without ever trying to dull it down the gorefest is exactly what you expect from a zombie film and even though this is a comedy it stays true to the zombie genre i was also happy that the zombies moved like zombies and not like the running idiots from the dawn of the dead remake i feel that the slow movement gives a creepier edge to the zombies that modern zombie flicks have losti feel that the hard work of simon pegg and edgar wright deserve to go down in history as a zombie film you should not be ashamed to ownan instant cult classic happy viewing,black_comedy

after hearing all of the buzz online about and seeing the dawn of the dead remake earlier in the year and enjoying it though it had nothing to do with or was nowhere near as good as romeros dead films including land of the dead i had extremely high expectations needless to say it far exceeded my expectations is a fantastic moviefirst off you will enjoy the film more if you like british humor like monty python or mr bean this is not saying you wont enjoy it if you dont like british humor but you may not find some of the jokes funnythe characters are great simon pegg is perfect as shaun and looks good sporting the white shirt and red tie nick frost is laid back as ed and pulls it of wonderfully the always useful bill nighy gives a great supporting performance as shauns stepdad all of the other characters are perfect in their roles as well especially liz and petethe comic genius of simon pegg nick frost and edgar wright is exactly that genius the film has so many hilariously funny parts especially whenever shaun and ed encounter zombies the way they deal with them is gutbustingly funny theres great dialogue between the characters especially between shaun and ed who are obviously friends in real life i wont give away any of the jokes youve got to watch it for yourself the likable characters play off of one another so well that it makes the film ten times better the film also has many amusing and much appreciated nods to romeros dead films when they talk to shauns mom on the phone listen to what ed says before they hang up being a big fan of romeros dead films and horror movies in general i was laughing at things most people didnt getonce the dead rise becomes an effective zombie movie but still retains its comedic elements the zombies themselves are very well done these are the shambling zombie variety which i prefer because i find them scarier the scenes when ed and shaun are driving through london are excellent displaying chaos and lots of zombies i loved the ambulance zombie very clever my favorite scene in the entire film is when shaun walks to nelsons shop after the zombies have risen the movie showcases some topnotch gore with some chunky zombie bites messy headshots and a scene where one character gets ripped in half and eaten if youre a gorehound like me you wont be disappointed yummy finally i loved the music edgar wright utilized some of goblins original music from the original dawn of the dead throughout the film it worked well with the film and was a nice nod to romero the music through the rest of the film ranges from british poprock to queen and it works perfectlythe bottom line a sidesplittingly funny zombie movie with some nice gore and excellent nods to george a romero is the perfect romzomcom romantic zombie comedy,black_comedy
i know i know ive barely started this review and i already fear it smacks of hyperbole but i cant help myself i have such love for this film i can hardly contain my geeky joyi am a lifelong fan of the horror movie in all of its forms from atmospheric and creepy classics to the most exploitative and gory grindhouse flicks my second favorite type of films are comedies from cheap scatological humor to the driest british wit i only mention my tastes here to point out that this movie satisfied me on pretty much every levelhorror and comedy are like two sides of the same coin and yet very few films have really blended them masterfully i would say that the short list of those which have includes an american werewolf in london the evil dead trilogy dead alive braindead and nowi found the horrific aspects of this film wonderfully executed and effective the scares run the gamut from quickcut boo shots to subtle ominous dark shadows to fullout bodyrending gore and the humorous aspects were likewise varied from crude bathroom humor to clever puns and popcultural referencesnot only does juggle laughs and scares with surprising skill but this film turns out to have a heart too billed as a romzomcom the fantastic elements of this film are kept in check by the affection of the characters for each otherthe underpinning of this tale of zombie madness is the everyday life of workingclass schlub shaun his longsuffering girlfriend liz and useless slacker buddy ed the relationship between these and other characters is really the main story with the undead plague providing a backdrop for much better dialog than ive come to expect from a zombie movie by creating characters that the viewer can care about sotd achieves an emotional depth between the gags and the gristle the last frame of the film is truly a moment that made me laugh and cry at the same timeobviously i have nothing but praise for for me it was an instant addition to my top ten list i highly recommend that you see it often,black_comedy
theres no doubt this entertaining british comedy has all the makings of becoming a cult hit much like the george a romero horror films that it pays homage towriters simon pegg who also stars and edgar wright who also directs clearly have a lot fun with this story there are several moments of truly inspired comedy and understated wit much of the comedy here works because the actors take themselves seriously they treat as very real the situations in which their characters get thrown intowhats clever about this film is that it doesnt come off as a pure spoof of horror films that would be easy too easy instead this is a horror film but comes packed with laughsthe best jokes actually have little or nothing to do with the zombies and everything to do with shaun and his friendspeggs ideal as shaun a lumbering clueless twentysomething who works at an electronic store where hes quite possibly the oldest employee his best friend ed nick frost lives on shauns couch and plays video games all day which is what shaun would love to do too but he cant because his girlfriend liz kate ashfield wants him to do more with his lifesome of the comedy is very inspired some comedic moments actually have layers to them for instance when shaun and ed throw shauns lp record collection at the zombies that scene would have worked as it is but pegg and wright add another layer by having the two chaps take time to discuss which records are worth tossingand then theres the moment when shaun hungover walks through his neighborhood oblivious to whats happening around him hes such a creature of habit that he doesnt notice obvious signs of something gone horribly pearshapedunfortunately pegg and wright cant sustain their comedy throughout the film falters in the final act when pegg and wright literally write themselves into a corner the film suddenly turns into a straight zombiehorror film right out of romeros handbook by placing their characters in an untenable situation a place from where theres little chance of escaping the story falls into all the conventional traps of the genre and its nothing we havent seen before right down to characters standing by windows just waiting to be yanked away by zombiesthe flaw in the third act is that pegg and wright forgot theyre making a comedy frankly zombies arent all that interesting as movie characters shaun and his buddies are but turning the film into a standard zombie film wasnt the right thing to do not only does it bring the comedy to a screeching halt it also makes the film drag even at a mere 99 minutes this film feels about 1015 minutes too longhowever the first twothirds of the film are awfully funny its dry bold and inventive too bad pegg and wright just didnt have enough for a better denouement,black_comedy

at last someone has taken the only logical step with a zombie movie made a comedy out of it we always laughed at the campiness at dawn of the dead and other such flicks the filmmakers have made the natural progression to romantic zombie comedyfor zombies are not incredibly scary yeah they eat ya but you pretty much have to be nailed to the floor for them to catch youhas taken this approach with the zombie flick and has done it to tremendous applause this film is funny satirical a bit tender at times but very entertaining it is the best approach to a zombie film i have ever seenit also shows that comedy is not dead its just american comedy thats dead the brits have continued to nail it from monty python to the original whos line is it anyway to office space and nowhollywood can learn something about how to make funny movies from these cats9 out of 10 there is a bit in the middle where it slows down too much but beyond that it is a classicbarky,black_comedy
first i must say that many friends told me rent this one we read on the internet is very funny but when we saw the movie our general comment was trashreally are all of you agree to vote this movie with 78and 9 pointsthere are only two funny scenes in the full movie the rest is simply trash another zombie movie more not funny at all except by the acting like a zombie scene really very funny and the scenes in the gardenthe rest of the minutes of the movie are stupid and with no humor sense try better the real dawn of the dead movie to see a real zombie movie instead of this simply bad movie,black_comedy
what i can say i was bored the entire time it was a horror comedy that was neither scary nor funny the jokes all fall flat and the overly dramatic scenes were too intense for a feelgood comedy all the characters were unlikable and by the end i was rooting for them all to die one of the cool things about zombie movies is the gore this movie had almost no gore instead of having guns or swords they hurt the zombies by hitting them with blunt objects this didnt kill them or destroy their brains it just dazed them for awhile boooring what a terrible movie easily the worst zombie movie ever made and this is coming from a guy whos seen day of the dead and i zombie,black_comedy
this is the worst parody ive ever seendidt even found anything funnywhy are all the reviews positive,black_comedy
this movie is kinda the start of non told series of movies which is the result of cooperation betweenedgar wright and simon pegg  the next movie in the series is hot fuzz and then at worlds endits better not to compare any of the movie in the series with each other because they are separated story wise but the similarities include the same directing team almost the same actors team and the same genrei saw it as a sarcastic movie about the zombies idea the scenes and the comedian parts werent that funny but the good thing that they kept everything simple the idea is simple the make up and eye lenses of zombies are simple the killing scenes and the places included are simple so everything was clear to the pointfinally its a good comedy zombie movie that can get you out of a bad mood although it has some points that may get you bored,black_comedy

taking a satire and turning it into a real movie takes an incredible amount of talent allaround sure everyone including me loves simon pegg and his best boyfriend nick frost and they get huge credit on screen in turning dawn of the deads spoof into a raging success even by todays standards but it was mainly the writing by both pegg and also director edgar wrighti used to be a huge spoof fan until 2000s scary movie one of my alltime favorite comedies put an end to actual funny spoofs four years later unbeknownst by me came another great parody i didnt know about it because it fell far under my radar and i probably didnt see this the first time until 56 years later just recently 83113 i watched it for the second timei am fully aware this lands on a ton of peoples top list and i truly liked it myself but i wouldnt go as far to land it in my top whatever list okay maybe spoofs since theres so few really good ones but thats about itmy only real problem is the movie runs out of breath in the last act gore replaced comedy in the last third and yeah its to remind us this is also a zombie movie but to me it felt more like they ran out of jokes and lost focus on what the first twothirds were all aboutthat said the first two acts were fantastic absolutely hilarious and ingenious use of both comedy and the zombie genre all with deadpan deliveries basically shaun pegg lives the same droll life and this is affecting his relationship with his girlfriend but not so much his best boyfriend ed frost unfortunately for the threesome  eh maybe also the world a zombie outbreak occurs and not coincidentally mirrors shauns existencethere were many opportunities to exploit the potential humor in a zombie outbreak film and i doubt writers pegg and wright missed a single one leading up to our heroes finding out whats going on and a little beyond the acknowledgment it was one hilarious scene following the next mercifully they chose the much preferred by me slowmoving zombies in order to give the cast a lot more time to give us more entertainmentif you havent yet seen this and are a fan of zombie films or even dislike them and would like to see them ridiculed this is your movie it is also the teaming of pegg and frosts absolute best film even though they would make a couple more enjoyable flicksgotta love lines like were coming to get you barbara  ed,black_comedy
my son made me watch this camp takeoff and im glad he dida wonderfully funny homage to george romero its got more zombies blood and gore than any movie ive ever seen though thin on plot its a well written and well directed film more than could be said for any of romeros films great cinematography with long traveling shots well developed characters and i do mean characters and a very subtle build up to the introduction to the first zombies though we all know its comingif you are looking for some good bloody fun and are a fan of camp check out,black_comedy
wow i love this film best zombie flick ever beats resident evil by far it made me laugh so much and sometimes made me jumpp i didnt know who on earth simon pegg was before i saw this but after watching this i made it my business to find out more now i know tons about him this movie is full of great actorsactresses like simon peggnick frost dylan moran and many others the soundtrack fits too  dont stop me now im having such a good time as shaun goes to work with a cricket bat i got the dvd for my birthday and watch it all the time ive passed it around my mates to watch and they love it too there should be more british comedy films like this one,black_comedy
at last a successful british comedy that doesnt involve upper middle class people falling in and out of love see love actually bridgette jones 4 weddings etc the film is manic and a little surreal in places but thrown in are some slower dramatic moments which compliment the comedy superblyit is pretty much what it says on the poster a romantic comedy with zombies there are some nice touches that comment on the modern style of living the laughs come thick and fast top scene goes to a memorable zombie death by vinyl lps a class act we can only hope theyll team up again for another film with them all being big star wars fans who knows darth vader as a zombie anyone,black_comedy
spoilers zombie films are the corner stone of so many childhoods constantly terrifying children since george romeros 1968 classic night of the living dead the notion has experienced a bit of a revival in recent years like so many different topics though its always been a curiosity how the rest of the world would cope other than america in wonderful spoof we finally learn how your every day brit deals with the impending threat of the walking deadshaun simon pegg is a hopeless 29 year old who works at an electronics store spends all his time in the pub and has just been dumped by his girlfriend now just when things feel like they cant get any worse the dead are walkinga masterful idea the entire notion of is pure genius transplanting the story of zombies to a typical london flat and its occupants there are so many potential ideas and it never ceases to exploit them whether bbc coverage t4 playing on the playstation or pub fruit machines the film is wonderful at poking fun at countless different aspects of the british lifestyleled by a solid performance by main star pegg the film has the cream of modern british comedy involved with it with dylan moran martin freeman lucy davis jessica stevenson and countless others the films casting is perfectthere are so many quality lines in this film too there are times you find yourself laughing at the most random of times then again though this is what you want for comedyall in all is amazing starring a solid cast and with some classic lines this film is a brilliant portrayal of how your typical brit would deal with a zombie threat a wonderful idea which is played out superbly well worth a watch,black_comedy
a very funny british comedy and funny parody of the dead trilogy its unlike scary movie or student bodies but it is funny nonetheless the title itself is a pun on dawn of the dead the film is about an average english worker who is trying to get his girlfriend back and making things right with his parents until for some unknown reason the dead begin to walk the earth and shaun together with his buddy ed decide to find their friends and shauns mom and girlfriend and get them to safety it had many funny moments like the day it started shaun and ed are very oblivious despite news broadcasts that the dead are taking over and the part when they pretend to be zombies just so they can get past them the film itself became very impressive to everyone including george romero himself i havent such hilarious stuff like this since student bodies now the guys behind this film simon pegg and edgar wright are now given cameospossibly zombie cameos on romeros forth upcoming film of the dead moviesthey shouldve brought nick frost in it jolly good show you two see you in land of the dead,black_comedy
i have never been a fan of zombie movies and never will but this was a slam dunk the first half is straight comedy and great comedy at that with the second half being more horror with some comedy thrown in shaun is a guy who works a average job but doesnt have much on the ball and no ambition to speak of please stop reading if this hits too close to home which it probably does for most of us guys not to mention the fact that he is dating a pretty girl who is getting way more than just tired of his backsliding and his complete lack of sensitivity and romantic tendencies all he wants to do is drink at his favorite pub the winchester and keep his relationship with her on life support which causes her to break up with him his roommate is a complete ahole and his best friend is a loser who doesnt have a job plays video games nonstop and sells weed he hates his fatherinlaw and he is sleepwalking through life then things start moving when zombies suddenly start appearing and shaun has to deal with them he does the best he can but not being up to snuff on zombie killing he has to try a little harder to save his family friends and even his girlfriend from joining the legions of undead the whole film is of course an homage and spoof of the caesar romero movies that the whole world has come to know and love and i feel it is worthy of just praise i would like to see a sequel and there may be one with all the favorable publicity and acclaim has received,black_comedy
the plot is the pretty standard zombie movie stuff some type of radiationvirus wreaks havoc on the earth reanimating the dead into brainless homicidal maniacs the movie does a good job of spoofing many of the conventions of the genre the title character shaun is so stuck in his hum drum existence it takes him a couple of days to realize that his city has been attacked by zombies he has a dead end job his girlfriend just broke up with him and his flat mates are constantly fighting despite their being several zombies eating human flesh around him and the constant media blitz about them it literally takes a zombie in his back yard for shaun to notice there are a number of truly funny scenes that mimic many of the classic zombie clichshere the zombies walk in the classic slow motion brain dead way they are mockingly slow in one scene sean and his friend ed throw a large crate full of junk at two zombies then have time to run for a crate of records and argue which records are crappy enough to launch the entire time the zombies are slowly walking towards them to devour sean and his friend other scenes have one zombie being beaten with pool sticks repeatedly to little or no effect time and time again there are little digs at the genre conventions while still lovingly following thema quick perusal of imdbs list of trivia for this film will show plenty of references to nearly every zombie film imaginable i consider myself a fan of zombie films but these guys must be nuts about them theyve set up multiple scenes that are exact homage to older films theyve lifted lines right out of the classics of the genre i must say that while reading the list i became more impressed with what the filmmakers created with this picture but while watching it most of the references went over my head as i said i like zombie movies theyre gory violent bloody and often hilarious intentional or otherwise i have seen more than my fair share of good and awful zombie flicks yet here most of the references were naught caught by me i cant exactly fault a film for referencing so many other films yet i have to wonder who but the diehard zombie fanatic caught themmy biggest complaint with the film is that it is too comedic without being funny enough what i mean by that is that the production is made like a comedy the actors play their parts as if they are in a comedy and not the horrible zombie addled situation that is scripted sure there are a few moments of anguished screaming and fear but those are over acted and far between the story is truly frightening the dead of came to life and are devouring the city this is not a light hearted romp though often quite funny zombie films play the situation straight i felt let down that everyone was playing the situation for gags and not allowing the comedy to be more organic or to flow out of the conventions of the genre itself in the end i didnt find the movie funny enough for all that it was played for humor all the way through yet i wasnt laughing nearly enough some of this comes from not getting all the in jokes some of this is also likely enough because it is a british comedy at heart there are a number of bits that seem to play better for the british sensibilities than my american in france heart there were several moments that i could see the joke play out and get it but it wasnt enough to really make me laugh this is not to say the movie isnt funny because it is often hilarious even its just that the tone of the film was of great comedy and the buzz i had heard matched this yet while watching it i didnt find it as funny as expectedwhile thinking about this review i began to wonder how i would make a zombie spoof better it wouldnt be right to go the zucker brothers way i got over that type of comedy in junior high and the genre well the horror genre which zombie movies are a subgenre of has been spoofed in this way enough see scary movie slap stick spoofs were perfected by sam raimi in the evil dead series in the end i decided that what the filmmakers were trying to do with this film is exactly the way to do it i just think they missed the mark a little i think i was partially disappointed because the genre itself has produced enough unintentional humor zombie movies are so often insanely bad they are great fun it is difficult to spoof a convention when the convention itself is so awful it seems a spoof unto itself likewise some of the conventions such as the ineptness and slow walk of the zombies has been revamped by the likes of danny boyle instead here i would have preferred a darker bloodier movie i dont believe this would have hurt the comedy the references and homages could have stayed in tact and comedy could come out of horrific situations,black_comedy
a tribute to george romero a comedy gore galore zombies abound what more could you ask for i thoroughly enjoyed this movie wish i would have gotten the chance to see it on the big screen but the nearest theatre playing this was 30 miles from my houseso i dl it off the internet loved it only negative thing was that since im not british im sure i missed out on a few jokesbut otherwise it was awesome i loved the way they meshed certain parts of romeros series into the film especially when the credits were rolling they played the music from the mall in dawn of the deadi pray that there is a sequel if there is i think i would drive the 30 miles to see it next time1010,black_comedy

im american saw this in nyc at a screening set up by fangoria magazine now to set up this review i have been a fan of britcoms for years from python to black adder to fawlty to father ted to black books to young onesetcso needless to say i enjoy the dry dark humor mixed perfectly with slapstick and sarcasm and i have been a fan of horror movies since i was first scared sless watching halloween home alone stupid thing to doi simply just loved this movie at first like some shows from england i had to hear the verbiage they speak quicker than me and have an accent obviously but once i found the pacing i was drawn in as usualclever doesnt do this justice it blended all the zombie movies i loved with some members of the office and python sense of humor not many movies can blend them fright night lost boys fearless vampire hunter and esp american werewolf in london are some of my fav blendings there were some hilarious moments even when people are dying there were some laughsand at the screening i was at there were some huge jumps from the screen its cool to be in the middle of the theatre and see hundreds of people jump in fear at the same time anyway i digress last year zombie movies were revived by 28 days later a truly scary and intense movie and dawn of the deada kick ass fun ride this cements the humor blend dont think anyone could do any better from hollywood although i would have thrown the sade album without thinking anyway would have loved to see these slacker gits tackle vampires and such instead of van helsing but thank god this movie had plot deep characters and a fun sense of style and spiritthanks for a refreshing happy moment here in america britian i certainly needed the charge to my creative life and the sense of fun again in my movie pleasures ,black_comedy
possible spoilerswhether or not you like simon pegg and the odd but refreshing british comedy he has introduced over the last few years remains to be seen but i think he has answered his critics with   there are some good zombie films but i am not a keen fan but if i was to say the best one then is miles ahead compared to the rest because i thought it was bloody brilliantthere is nothing you can say that would convince me that this film was a bad film  everything about it was just amazing from the story the gags the violence and the classy fast paced editing   i wouldnt even call this a cheap shot at dawn of the dead even though it is clearly better though i do like the original dawn of the dead  has the right to call itself an original zombie film as it has its own story and no one elses instead of shopping malls weve got pubs which is more better watching especially if youre british because you get al the jokes better   also we have our very own hero in the shape of shaun and what makes this even better is its sense of humour   dawn of the dead had this but shaun has it much more and is a black comedy more than anything   the beginning scenes where shaun is oblivious with what is going on around because of his own problems is just great and hilarious to watch because it doesnt look obvious that he is ignoring it  it just happens to be that he is looking elsewhere and has his mind on different things at the start of the chaos  what i loved a lot about it also was how everything that was happening around shaun but he wasnt noticing all the news reports and military trucks going past every five minutes until shaun becomes aware of the situation  it was great to see so many comic characters together in one movie as well like lucy davis from the office and a tiny cameo from martin freeman  bill nigh also was good as always but had a more serious role more than a comic one and of course simon pegg who is not the next anybody when comparing him to other characters  you could say he is the next ricky gervais or steve coogan but he is not he is simon pegg and he has just brought the best screen debut film for an actor to the big screen for the first time and has outdone everything he was capable of  there is even enough time to have some very emotional parts which will get the better of youthere are many british comedies that have be turned out over the last few decades but i can honestly say that this is the best since monty python bring brought a film to the big screen and thats a fact,black_comedy
lots of fun gore and not a serious zombie movie a must watch for uk teen comedies and uk horror fans,black_comedy
to be honest i dont have enough information to evaluate a movie as lighting  camera technics or shading i can classify movies as i like it or i dont like it i can clearly say that i dont like this movie also i feel really confused from its rating let me explain the topic shortly shaun is sales manager in a company one day he breaks up with his girlfriend liz then zombie apocalypse emerges so he wants to save his mother and ex girlfriend with his friend ed and the events develop let me criticise some facts about movie  people who wrote something about this movie say that it is the combination of horror and comedy but i neither laugh nor scare in this movie the other thing that people wrote about this movie is in the tarantinos favourite list  how can we say that this is terrible  i dont know you but its so easy for me to answer its just my pleasurei dont advice it  totally waste of time,black_comedy
beyond awesome ive seen it so many times ive lost count one of the best zombie movies ive ever seen bar none            ,black_comedy
this is one of my favorites movies of all time mash ups between horror and comedy is hard to master but this is flawless only uk could spawn a movie like this with the subtle wit in all dialogue frostpeggwright is truly a dream team,black_comedy
this is the only 2nd comic horror film i have seen having been put off by finding young frankenstein unfunny perhaps a letdown after the brilliant producers but i surprised myself in finding this film hysterically funny what prompted me to try it was the wonderful simon pegg who i saw in an episode of black books and the starstudded cast of other comic actors eg dylan moran bill nighy we all know these people the nerdy but nice fellow in a crap job who lacks the social skills to keep their friends girlfriends and other folk happy simultaneously but it was wonderful to watch this ostensibly sad character become the hero in the face of a zombie invasion this film was entertaining fast moving and gripping to the very end and the elements of sadness romance and conflict added to its charm it has whetted my appetite to watch more movies of this genre,black_comedy
this is so hilarious from the start cracking lots of jokes about how to overcome the zombie apocalypse that they are facing,black_comedy
a definite must see for the zombie lover fun and entertaining right to the end great when you need to lighten the mood but dont want to leave the zombie movie genre,black_comedy

the zombie comedy film is a subgenre that has been around for virtually as long as the zombie film itself a lot of people love them usually i do not i had head that this one was good so i decided to give it a tryimmediately i noticed the good production values and strong humor it toed the line between the dumb comedy that ruins most of these films for me and the sort of hilariously clever jokes that you cant help but laugh at that is the sweet spot what i call comedy gold recommend,black_comedy
enjoyed thisa lot of dry humor and sort of meta jokes,black_comedy
the zombie first appeared on film in 1930s with white zombie still they did not become horror staples until night of the living dead 1968 over the years zombies have morphed and evolved from slow walking chumps into ravenous hell hounds for over 70 years zombies lived on solely within traditional horror simon pegg and edgar wright changed that notion forever with their breakout comedyshaun pegg is a droll waste of human existence whose mediocrity is only surpassed by his flatmate ed nick frost after his girlfriend dumps him it seems only the apocalypse could make life worse for shaun to viewer delight that is precisely what happens armed with a sturdy cricket bat a scraped shovel and childish enthusiasm shaun and ed set out vying to survive there is a sense of familiarity in these protagonists which warmly draws the viewer we feel shauns worthlessness after the breakup this is in part due to long tracking shots as he accomplishes his daily tasks furthermore as shaun grows to be a champion and a leader the shots quicken and character movement grows exponentiallybetween laugh out loud brit humour and animated gore there are honestly sweet moments that further beg us empathize with shaun and that is the sign of a geat film a film should grab hold of the viewer place them in the heros shoes and excite them until the credits roll for those reasons alone remains a cult classic worthy of praise seldom offered horror films or comedies it defies two genres wholeheartedly while making no enemies along the way,black_comedy
this film is needless to say entertaining revolutionary take on the classic genre of zombie horror providing a new perspective and a less than scary view into the lives of apocalypse survivors shaun and ed this movie is a delightful comedy that seems juxtaposed to the dramatic nature of the world in chaos that is collapsing around the oddball pair by breaking the norm and giving a funny insight into a zombie apocalypse instead of a morose morbid one the death and destruction seem ironic and cheesy instead of terrifying the film has a very british sense of comedy and the pacing and jokes contribute to the lack of severity,black_comedy
the first of the cornetto trilogy comedy takes its cues from george a romeros zombie masterpieces but primarily from dawn of the dead the violence the gore and even the biting for a lack of a better term social commentary it just makes sense that when english humorists get their hands on this material it would become sharper and funnier is pretty damn funny edgar wright is the cinephile filmmaker of your dreams because he knows his zombie movies he knows that you know your zombie movies and it all comes together in a great time all around have a pint and watch the whole thing blow over,black_comedy
i was listing programmes on tv when i found this masterpiece so i decided to rewatch it its comedy gold and acting is just perfect and hillarious directing is amazing and you can see how good is camera working especially when it is following characters simon pegg and nick frost are best duo ever,black_comedy
this film is pure genius it launched edgar wright and simon pegg into the lime light and so it should have wright and pegg wrote the film together and directed and starred in it respectively shaun is in need of a kick up the backside and who wouldnt be motivated by the zombie apocalypse the tagline summarises this movie brilliantly therein a romantic comedy with zombies,black_comedy
for edgar wright simon pegg and nick frosts first film collaboration they took a simple story that they could get every bit of comedy gold out of while its definitely my least favourite of their work it was still the perfect note to start their trilogy ontheirs no way around it the casting and performances in this film are pitch perfect its clear every part in this film was written specifically for the actors who played them pegg and frost obviously have perfect comedy timing but they pulled of just as many dramatic scenes as well all the supporting actors made the roles their own and played of the two leads wellthe directing in this film is vibrant and alive like all of wrights film it feels like i could watch this film for days on end and still discover new hidden details and references he put in the film for viewers to discover the comedy in this film is some of the most inventive ive ever seen theirs so many examples of visual comedy as their are in the scriptthe romance in this film really didnt do a lot for me it was by far the most generic and cliche element of the film and i was far more invested in pegg and frosts friendship than i was in pegg trying to win back his girlfriend as much as i love watching this film i dont consider it much more than a very clever comedy but for wrights feature debut i couldnt have asked for anything elsei really do love this film its endlessly hilarious and visually inventive the characters are likeable and its absolutely a film i could watch at any time and still enjoy it every time8710  a fantastic,black_comedy
this review contains spoilersis a horror comedy movie directed by edgar wright and written by edgar wright and simon pegg the movie stars simon pegg and nick frost the movie premiered in 2004 and is about a zombie apocalypse in london from the perspective of a tv salesman without much direction in his life the movie primarily follows shaun played by simon pegg and ed played by nick frost as they navigate the zombie apocalypsethis movie is a cult classic there are countless hilarious scenes that this movie has there is a wide array of humor here as there are funny dumb moments and funny moments with a long pay off the humor in the movie does die down in the later parts of the movie with character deaths this is luckily helped by the good direction in the latter half of the movie the movie also paces its humor out well as the movies scenes have many fun small touches that might only be seen by the audience on a second watch one of the scenes that had me in tears was shaun walking through the neighborhood after the zombie apocalypse in a mirror of an earlier scene the movie is filled with these moments that make the movie incredibly enjoyableedgar wrights direction is certainly helpful in this movie the film moves at an electric pace matched by the electric direction and editing it was even a joy watching the more mundane parts of shaun and eds lives the cutting style in this movie helped a lot with making every moment seem fun i do not think i was ever bored throughout the 99 minutes of running time in the movie there is not a scene or dialogue wasted in this moviethe main leads of simon pegg nick frost and kate ashfield work incredibly well these actors have great comedic timing and delivery it is definitely easy to root for shaun to prevail as he is this lovable buffoonthe plot of the movie is basic anyone that has watched dawn of the dead or any mainstream zombie movie can predict the story does not do anything new to the zombie genre story wise the newness comes from the comedy in the movieis an incredibly well done movie i highly recommend the movie to both audiences that do not like the zombie genre and existing fans the movie is one of 2004s highlightsfour stars out of four stars for,black_comedy
i found my new favorite movie everything from the acting to the writing was phenomenal,black_comedy
really it was total fun to watch it they made the movie horror with lots of humour i seriously enjoyed it a lot,black_comedy
may be a perfect movie i hits all the right notes it never has a misstep all of the performances are great the jokes are so funny the sad parts are played just right a big part of this movie is the editing it creates such a great flow that the movie just pulls you in unfortunately these guys turned out to be onehit wonders thats a shame i was hoping that they were going to have a great run that said is one of the most entertaining movies i have ever seen,black_comedy
as another brit comedy flick certainly has some illustrious peers such as lock stock and 4 weddings however while its certainly not in the same league as any of these it still holds its own reasonably wellsimon pegg is shaun an average joe sales assistant in a fairly crummy flat with very little to look forward to ed is his best friend and flatmate and when everyone begins to turn into a zombie this one aint overly realistic they put together a motley crew and set out to survive the onslaught of the dead walkingyes more than a nod towards the romero dead trilogy is in evidence here not least of all in the name plenty of other homages are showcased but it obviously helps to have seen the originals otherwise you just wont get themthis is a comedy but it lacks a lot of laughs and that is the main criticism when it tries to be funny it succeeds but it doesnt try often enough this is a huge shame there are many moments of amusement which arent belly laughs but for a comedy you expect to laugh out loud a little more oftena very clique cast is featured here with actors and actresses who are known as offscreen friends playing most of the main roles that chemistry works on screen in places but not allthe direction does what its supposed to without being especially inspiring and the acting is sitcom standard overall its decent enough entertainment but ultimately it could have been a bit better,black_comedy
the british penchant for understatement and the audiences perfect understanding of slackers mix to make zombie spoof both funny and appropriate for a society that fosters couch potatoes and underachieving 29 year olds so universal is the satire that hollywood moviemaking and dear old mums are not sparedobviously from the title george romeros dawn of the dead and numerous other zombie flicks are cannibalized as they rise themselves from the dead heap of old b movies to amuse audiences and in this case scare them as well director edgar wright who has many british tv series in his resume knows enough about contemporary 20something working class blokes to amuse everyone shaun simon pegg an electronics store employee cant live up to the ambitious expectations of his girlfriend liz kate ashfield most of his time is spent defending his authentic slacker roommate buddy ed nick frost who trashes the living room with junk food detritus and watches endless tv and games eds comic ability at surprise flatulence or imitating an orangutan amuses and endears shaun to himthe fun comes when zombies begin roaming london streets and shaun is so distracted by his own challenges that he doesnt see them when he does and he is called upon to act heroically the winchester arms pub a home for the guys and source of irritation for liz becomes home base against the armies of the nightas in harold and kumar the humor is low but the pace is leisurely enough not to force the satire as lost skeleton of cadavra did last year the characters are fully fleshed enough to make us sympathetic to them a remarkable feat for movies about zombies where characters are usually as undead themselvesby the way if you want a real contemporary zombie flick see28 days later by british director danny boyle trainspotting it is the best horrorzombie film since george romeros night of the living dead and maybe betterzombie conventions are fully lampooned in george romero would approve its funny stuff so see it in a theater before you turn into a potato watching it on your crumby couch,black_comedy
before we go anywhere please consider this you dont hear europeans state of american films which populate 80 of our cinemas that was a waste of time because we didnt get all the jokes that happens in all movies some films aim at an intellectual level which some people dont get and on the other hand we have modern cultural gags that the academic elite will fail to understand i have seen many us movies that a damn big selection of jokes and this includes the simpsons or whatever that will go over my head i just dont get all the cultural references but hey thats ok it doesnt spoil the film in its entiretyso hell yeah there are british references for the british audience but that doesnt detract from the overall message or story and yes the british do swear that much maybe they dont swear enough in the film considering the issues they facefinally go see this film its not the greatest film ever maybe not the greatest film you will see this month but its funny sad gory and a great slash at the slacker generation that you either hate or fear becomingalso as you may think its not a spoof movie the laws of physics are standard we dont have celebrity gags or visual perspective jokes and on occasions the pathos and depth of feeling in this film are quite stunning you will never see a horror movie like this in a long time and at least you will be helping a small independent group of talented writers and actors earn their duesalso i hope the rest of the world has swingball too and yes english cricket bats are that strong,black_comedy
anyone who likes spaced will love this film as it captures all the style and humour of the show although it isnt loaded with movie references this is the funniest film to come out of the uk for a long time and despite its low budget looks good too like spaced there is lots of flashy camera work which doesnt really add much to the film although it gives it a bit more energy which is always welcome the cast are excellent and are clearly enjoying themselves whether theyre playing fruit machines or having their intestines pulled out the violence is fairly graphic but there isnt as much as youd expect considering the subject matter one of the best things about the film apart from it being hilarious is how unpredictable it is i was expecting everyone to come out of the pub alive and i was definitely expecting shauns mum to make it luckily this film avoids following any formula and saves a satisfying twist for the final scene the only criticisms i have are that dylan morans character was too serious i was expecting a lot of laughs from him after black books and others were underused a whole line of british comic talent including matt lucas and martin freeman was wasted as they only appeared for a few seconds these minor flaws aside this film is a mustsee gem cant wait for the dvd,black_comedy
please do not watch this movieits totally unreasonable stupid full of silly lines awfulthe main characteristic of cinema is that you should actually believe what you see no matter how weird it seemsi did not believe the characters even for one bithow can someone experience the apocalypse and have comments about a sport car how stupid are we to believe in this storylinei dont want to say more its just a silly moviei love zombie films this is just silly i love zombie films this is just silly i love zombie films this is just silly,black_comedy
if you like the other two films in the trilogy youll like if you didnt you wont in all honesty its as simple as that really there a very thin story in place but really the strength of the film is the interaction between pegg frost and co as they battle seemingly endless undead zombiesbill nighy pops up and steals the film as ever and he is one of the many famous faces that appear here along the wayhot fuzz is probably the best of the trilogy but there is a lot to like about this film,black_comedy
the comedy starts very well with the team that later would do hot fuzz putting out a lot of funny ideas i especially liked the view of early morning people that look and act like zombies anyway then i loved the way it all gradually translated into the zombie thingbut then it all fell apart bill nighy had the smallest of roles when he could have added a lot of humour there the puns and jokes just went silent while they were either bashing zombies or running away from themjust as hot fuzz it started really well and then stalled like an airplane going straight upbottom line funny zombie movie definitely worth watching but a bit disappointing,black_comedy
shaun never pays attention to his girlfriend liz lives with his flatulentdrug dealing flatmate ed and never has time for his mum hes been going out with liz for three years and she still hasnt met his mumwhen liz finally dumps shaunhes left feeling alone and unwanted while all this is going on the world has become overrun by the undead literally overnightwhile all the world is panicking about this ordeal shaun and everyone else around him are oblivious to their surroundings when shaun and his mate ed finally do come around to the idea that they might actually get eaten alive they realise their are three things they must dofirst rescue liz second rescue mumoh and kill philipsorry philip and thirdly go to the winchester put their feet up and wait for all this to blow overyeah right,black_comedy
what could have been a complete misfire in a tired genre that now features spedup undead monsters comes as a fresh genuinely hilarious farce that for about an hour and forty minutes takes us on a ride that never lets upa nice subtext that seems to say that the reason people are becoming zombies is the fact that their routines are the cause of this shaun emerges as the lone antihero that will confront his own deadend existence and by way of craziness regain his girlfriend regain his own sense of self and regain his routine of playing video games with his best friend ed even when he has to be chained is a cleverly written story full of very british humor completely aware of its poking fun at the zombie genre and is a great movie to watch and be entertained by without looking too deep into it,black_comedy
from the opening credits with goblins music i had somewhat high expectations i knew it was going to be a comedic spoof of dawn of the dead what i didnt know was that it was going to be a stupid comedic spoof with british punchlines it was also very slow moving and i couldnt believe for one moment that a guy like shaun who was so anal about his life the dry erase chalkboard on his refrigerator and the way he coached his employees at the tv store didnt notice all the chaos occurring all around him practically every tv station in england is showing dead bodies and widespread sickness and shaun and his bumbling roommate are changing the channel to play video games the rest of the movie reminded me a lot of a guy ritchie film with the camera angles and scenes shooting back and forth like lightning i think that the next time george romero sanctions anyone to do a remake or spoof of his classic he should do the final edits and ask for more money by the way folks nothing against the british,black_comedy
i had pegged as one of those straighttovideo movies that pops up every once in a while featuring a clever lampooning of something popular in movies at the time in the wake of a spectacular remake of dawn of the dead it was not hard to come to this conclusion but not only in more than a straighttovideo sideshow hoping for a few minutes of attention its a tremendous installment in the horror genre that shows that romantic subplots can indeed have a place in scary movies what is truly amazing is that jerry bruckheimer can screw up romantic subplots in movies that seem to demand romance and yet director edgar wright is able to make it work in a gory zombie movie this is outstandingthe best parts of the movie are the gradual evolution from a romantic comedy and into a horror film that takes place over the first third or so the movie opens in a serious conversation between shaun and his amazingly beautiful and adorable girlfriend liz in which they discuss how unhappy liz is with the way their relationship is going they each complain about the others friends all of whom are sitting right there listening shauns inability to find anything else to do other than hang out at the same pub the winchester and work at the same deadend job have led to liz issuing an ultimatum change things or shes outta here i love that the movie is so effective both as a horror film and a romantic comedy while at the same time going significantly out of its way to make fun of those two genres my favorite is the way the sound is manipulated early in the film horror films constantly manipulate sound to create scares and tension such as the screeching cat scare and this movie makes fun of that tactic giving extreme closeups and vastly amplified sound for things like brushing teeth and spreading jam on toast as shaun goes through a typical day the day after his conversation with liz he notices things here and there that seem out of the ordinary like lines of massive military vehicles rushing past his workplace a man obviously terrified running past him at full speed and a staggering man across the street who picks up a pigeon with the intention of eating it if you think about it most of the more wellknown zombie movies start out in the middle of the crisis they dont take the time to show normal society they just start out focusing on a small group of people the last survivors in what is by now an almost complete decimation of the human race which has consumed itself you might say here everything is normal and the movie takes the time to show what it might be like for the average person if the walking dead started eating people and turning them into walking dead as wellthere are frantic news reports that offer vague theories as to what is causing the crisis but like the military vehicles and other strange things that shaun noticed he always gets distracted before he catches on to what is going on which allows room for some of the most memorable scenes in the movie like when shaun and his best friend ed one of lizs major complaints leave the winchester that night pleasantly intoxicatedin the morning shaun wakes up and walks across the street to the corner store like he does every day and doesnt notice the chaos that has erupted overnight when he gets back there is a hilarious scene where he and shaun find a zombie stuck in their backyard apparently unaware of where she is or where to go this is a perfect example of where the movie most sharply departs from the traditional zombie movie shaun and ed dont react like actors in a gore movie they react like normal people would in such a situation when the zombie girl turns around they look at her shocked and then laugh at how drunk she must be when she falls and suffers a significant injury only to get right back up the looks on shauns and eds faces are absolutely pricelessfrom this point the movie turns into the more traditional horror film but it maintains its originality and romantic comedy portion by stopping occasionally to remind you that the other plot has not been forgotten there are times throughout the movie where the characters are surrounded by zombies and stop completely to argue about their personal differences at one point they are literally surrounded by hundreds of zombies only a few feet away and ed stops to sit casually on a nearby bench and talk to someone on his cellphone shaun smacks it out of his hand and essentially tells him that thats exactly the problem with him i think that where is most successful is in the blending of these two seemingly incompatible story lines a lesser movie would have tried to mix together a romantic comedy and a horror movie and ended up screwing them both up trying to please everyone and ultimately pleasing no one however tried to please everyone and succeeds because it doesnt disenfranchise anyone it doesnt start as a romantic comedy then turn into a horror movie that solves the romantic comedy because liz fell back in love with shaun who in the course of the horror portion had become a hero thats how you screw up a movie with a premise like this instead the movie weaves this tapestry of horror and romantic comedy each infiltrating and playing off of the other becoming in the process a success in both areas and something truly unique and even if it had done nothing but make a zombie movie unique it would have been a success but there is so much more there dont miss this one,black_comedy
romantic comedyhorror film taking place in england about shaun and his friends trying to stay alive when the dead come alive and eat the flesh of the livingyepit had to happen eventuallya comedy about flesheating zombies surprisingly it really does work this is one of the few movies that successfully mixes horror comedy and drama the only other ones i can think of are the howling american werewolf in london and abbott and costello meet frankenstein not all the jokes work but about 95 of them do and the dramatic moments actually are wellworked into the plot and this movie has plenty of blood and gore for an r rated film if this had been done seriously the ratings board probably would have demanded cuts now i did like it and was laughing out loud more than once but it has some minor problems most of the characters are extremely unlikable especially shauns best friend the film has its share of dead spots and some scenes are way too tragic for a film like this still that aside this is a very funny gory movie a must for horror fans try to see it with an audienceit really comes alive that way,black_comedy
hearing so much about built my expectations high is a parody of zombie movies with ever day life any generation xer will get the factoryservice industry humor xers live a very left out hard paced brain dead zombie existence i can relate to this humor with my job and the people around me over educated xers expect more and have seen a depressing decline in the quality of life while parents and other generations sometimes do not understand us the family part of the movie explains this perfectly life seems pretty bad after college were one makes all their contacts there is a lot of social humor about gen x in this film many people who live in such situations need a childish friend like shaun has which shaun needs for stress releases no one else understands why shaun hangs out with his loser friend but this friend keeps shaun sane the zombie humor would not work if done on this side of the atlantic the british have a flair for dryin a good way like dry red wine foolish humor the shes drunk scene was great along with the dad turning off the car radio comedy is hard to do and the films makers got away with making a funny movie with such a hard concept worth renting the dvd over the going to see it 6 or 7 out of 10 but i probably buy the movie i love dry humor one part of the movie that surprised me is how similar the service industry is marketed with north american style best buy and walmart shops,black_comedy
its 27th february 2011 its sunday and i am trying to find something funny and interesting to do thank god for film industries and thank god for napster for making my usual boring days a bit interesting i feel like watching a zombie movie that i havent already watched before i thought i wasnt going to find anything by typing top zombie movies of all time in google but i was wrong i have seen several lists containing as their number 1 so i open an imdb site like i do it for every movie im about to watch and find this movie in it and wow over 100 000 votes rating this movie with 810 as a british zombie comedy without any famous actors it should be great and it should be unique i thought but i was wrongat the beginning of this movie i have seen a few decent jokes which made me produce some kind of a heh sound with a bit of exhaling but thats all im talking about first 20 minutes at this moment i was still expecting something that main character starts realizing the whole town is filled with zombies so i was at least expecting some funny killing or whatever but no it was just getting worse and worse total lack of story humor and horror so am at the point of the movie when i realize that this movie is rubbish and im thinking the only way this movie could get so good reviews is because of the brilliant ending and thats the only reason i decided to watch this movie till the end the guy ends up playing playstation with his best friend who turned to zombie there are people who could make that scene funny but simon pegg isnt one of them140 000 people rated this movie 120 000 of them are british and rated it 9 or 10 if someone would remove all british voters from here the movie wouldnt get a decent 410 which is still too good for this movie i will forget this movie in a month or so but until then i will always regret why i spent 100 minutes of my life watching this peace of low budget crap,black_comedy
my son dragged me to see this ive gone with him to his comic book movies his other zombie movies and on and on so i was set for one of those dadis willingtogiveupaday things this utterly tongue in cheek masterpiece had me from the getgo there are so many sight gags and pop culture references so many goofy encounters so much character to the undead i really enjoyed this i see now why it became a cult film because it is infinitely quotable and full of absurdities it also has a really fine cinematic sense i also loved what the role of the zombies is at the end of the picture if one has ever worked with high school boys or lazy male young adults you will find a great deal to enjoy here really,black_comedy
this is a perfect example of a movie that holds up with age this came out in 2004 when i was only 14 im now 26 and i love this movie even more than when i first saw it and that really says somethingso whats there to tell about three adults in their late 20searly 30s who live together in a small apartmentwell its a classic situation if youve ever seen one shaun works pete works ed just sits on his fat ass all day smoking weed and playing video games we all know that one person right shaun and his girlfriend liz live apart and seemingly dont spend that much time together apart from hanging out at the same pub over and over and over again which causes tension between shaun and lizafter shaun and liz have a rather ugly break up due to their anniversary celebration going pear shaped shaun and ed hit their favorite pub the winchester and basically get blind drunk go home carrying on like lunatics and play loud music till roughly four in the morning which only gets put to a stop when pete comes downstairs in a fit of rageafter they wake up the next morning obviously hungover as hell shaun goes to the corner store again to get his paper and snacks as part of his morning routine not even realizing whats going on around him this is easily one of the funniest scenes of the entire movie theres dead corpses in the streets zombies staggering towards him people running away in fear he even slips on blood in the convenience store and flat out doesnt even realize its almost as if the film wants us to believe shaun is that hungover that he doesnt even remotely see the zombie apocalypse erupting all around himafter shaun and ed finally get the gist of whats going on they make plans to go and rescue liz and shauns mother the hilarity only continues when zombies try to break into their apartment and they resort to throwing vinyl records at them as a means of defense also they not only make plans to kill shauns father inlaw phil whos played by bill nighy but ed ends up driving phils much treasured jaguar which hes always wanted to dothe finale at the winchester is basically just slap stick comedy but its enjoyable all the same if you like some funny adult jokes at appropriate times slapstick style action sequences and just plainly watching a bunch of fools doing what they can to survive with jokes thrown in wherever they will fit this is the movie for you terrific comedy any way you look at it this is the film that made me want to go to london ,black_comedy
ill kick off this review by saying simon pegg and nick frost work so well together if a film has these 2 actors in its bound to be greatthis film is totally epic its a mashup mainly of 3 genres action comedy and horror but with some elements of romcom and thrillerthe action is extremely overthetop and gory full of blood guts and brain splatter also it has some very funny scenes including the dont stop me now bar scene but also some very sad character deathssimon peggas usual gives a great performance as shaun a 29 year old loser with a dull easy life and a job in an electronics store when hes not working at the electronics store he lives with his goofball best friend ed nick frost who also gives a great performance in a small flat on the outskirts of london where they mainly mess around and eat cornettos but his girlfriend liz kate ashfield wishes desperately for shaun to grow up and be a man when the town is overrun with zombies shaun must rise to the occasion and protect both liz and her friends and his mother penelope wiltonit has some very good acting performances and funny dialogue but also some very sad scenes overall it is a great mashup of genres and it all works and comes together to make one hell of a movieso i give a 97510 or 5 stars,black_comedy
it has been nearly 10 years since the release of one of the greatest zombie movies ever made this film started the infectious zombie craze that still lingers today im taking about edgar wrights starring simon pegg and nick frost a cult fan boy film from the start shauns mix of dry british humor and graphic zombie violence has made its claim as one of the best its a romantic comedy with zombies its a buddy picture with zombies its many things to many people but above all its just a fun moviesimon pegg plays shaun a regular guy who likes nothing more that to spend time with his friends at the local pub called the winchester his best mate is ed an overweight and crude but harmless schlub who has been friends with shaun since primary school liz is shauns way to hot girlfriend who is fed up with there stale and predictable relationship shaun also lives with his older and more put together brother who tells him to get your st together shaun works as a supervisor at an electronics store with a bunch of unmotivated chowder heads who dont pay any attention to him or what he has to say to round out shauns circle of people is his kind but spacey mum and cold and stern step father phillip played by bill nighyafter a long night of drinking at the winchester shauns usual surroundings start to look a little off unknown to him and ed it seems that the zombie apocalypse has struck its kind of hard to notice these things when everybody acts like zombies in their everyday lives shaun and ed finally come to the conclusion that something is not right and hatch a plan to rescue their friends and family and find a safe place to wait out this annoying apocalypse thing the premise is simple but extremely well done the script is packed with several memorable one liners and gags that make it fun for multiple viewingswith their true to life characters and the smart insightful dialogue filmmaker edgar wright and simon pegg seem to be channeling kevin smith and his debut film clerks along with 2007s hot fuzz and 2013s the worlds end these three film created the cornetto trilogy a cornetto being an ice cream cone something like a drumstick that appears in each film if it isnt already obvious shaun is a movie that should be bought and watched regularly,black_comedy
is a zombie comedyhorror movie directed by edgar wright and starring simon pegg and nick frost the team behind the tv series spaced and the movies hot fuzz and the worlds end which together they form the cornetto trilogythe movie stars the titular shaun a man who doesnt have a clear direction in life he doesnt like his job he has problems with his girlfriend and his family and must always stand up for his lazy housemate jobless friend ed all those seem to be the least of his problems when apparently theres a zombie apocalypse taking place outside edgar wright does a brilliant job directing the movie and proves to handle with great touch both humor drama and action in the beginning of the movie we are presented with lots of tips and imagery that the zombie apocalypse is impending however since shaun has to deal with all his personal problems he barely notices all the signs theres even a scene where all the news channels talk about this problem but he just flips the channels carelessly its a great comedic touch considering how much it takes for shaun and ed to realize there are actual zombies invadingis clearly an homage to every zombie movie ever made especially george romeros movies the script written by pegg and wright is full of references and tributes to classic zombie movies like dawn of the dead day of the dead and so on the trio of pegg wright and frost really treat the genres of movies they love with lots of respect the same can be said about hot fuzz which is clearly inspired by buddy cop movies or the worlds end who has its roots in classic sciencefiction stories if youre a hardcore zombie fan this is the movie for you but it also works great for a casual viewer who maybe is more interested in the comedy aspect that than the horror the movie combines excellent touches of humor with some powerful drama there are a few strong full of impact scenes that are clearly needed so that the viewer will know that this is not just a silly parody its a real solid movie with great performances and a funny clever script clearly worth a watch 8 out of 10,black_comedy
brilliantly deliberate in its writing and dry satirical jokes is a top of the horrorcomedy genre jokers are subtle and littered throughout viewers should easily be able to pick up something new each time watching the uncomfortableness of shauns life scenarios ends up being a tremendous setup to the end of the world zombie outbreak the dialogue is terrific script and story is flawless and the characters are all purposeful and welldeveloped simon pegg and nick forst are a great duo hilarious and complement each others performance perfectly the gore is definitely there still and its definitely unforgiving to the characters in the film even the likable ones is a classic and a film that will go down as one of the most memorable and quotable horrorcomedies,black_comedy
is a 2004 britishfrenchamerican horror comedy film directed by edgar wright and written by wright and simon pegg and starring pegg and nick frost shaun simon pegg is a 30something loser with a dull easy existence when hes not working at the electronics store he lives with his slovenly best friend ed nick frost in a small flat on the outskirts of london the only unpredictable element in his life is his girlfriend liz kate ashfield who wishes desperately for shaun to grow up and be a man when the town is inexplicably overrun with zombies shaun must rise to the occasion and protect both liz and his mother penelope wilton,black_comedy
2004 dir edgar wright  cast simon pegg nick frost kate ashfield bill nighy penelope wilton hilarious and sickening both at once the film addresses deadpan lifestyles reduced to routine shaun works at a dead end job and comes home to his lazy roommate ed who plays video games all day at night they hang out at a local bar where his girlfriend expresses her desire to either move forward in their relationship or call quits great background information surrounded by the reality that the dead have risen and zombies stagger aimlessly about the funny thing is that shaun doesnt notice them as he goes about his day satire of zombie movies that only disappoints in its violent and graphic finale director edgar wright does a fantastic job at keeping everything coherent simon pegg is hilarious as shaun who must rescue his mother and set things right with his girlfriend played wonderfully by kate ashfield nick frost plays the lazy ed who has his resources in the zombie fight but his video game days will conclude through dead eyes bill nighy is amusing as shauns stepfather who will become infected but not without issuing an apology penelope wilton plays shauns mother whom he goes through gory hell to preserve in human form and fail very gross comedy that succeeds in mocking a very dead horror franchise score 8  10,black_comedy
2004clearly ridiculous and clearly funny for some it doesnt get much more comic and hilarious both exaggerated and subtle actually by luck good or bad i have seen several british movies with the same comic team the same actors namely simon pegg but also some background people like director edgar wright and there are more similarities in the plots and funny moments than you might expect which means fewer original laughs the main culprit is the worlds end which is also a good time but there is the pub at the center of things and the zombieandroids in both and a feeling of friends helping friends fight the evils its funny once but be careful twice or im sure if you think one movie is stellar youll possibly love the other these two and another called hot fuzz which i havent seen are officially a trilogy and so are naturally overlapping such is successthis is the classic and the first and has its own reputation that goes beyond just another zombie movie see also zombieland from 2009 which i liked even more also a spoof the funniest aspect of shaun is the sense of not noticing the zombies then the kind of normal approach to having a zombie in your yard or in your house or car or finding that your best friend or mum is a zombie etc it brings it away from the horror film genre almost completely even when there is chaos and near annihilation there is also a feeling of hilarity there is always a ray of hope and there is love sort of that constant rescuer in films of all flavorsthe zombies are terrificthey stay to what i think of as the necessary romero styled zombie style with the rules of walking and acting a certain way unlike world war z which was hyped up in that sense if you worry about zombies entering your world and want to know what to do see this one and see of course the very original from the current era the archetypal night of the living dead which as some quality of perfection that cant be ignored here of course it makes fun but it does so in a way that says its all for real toosee it,black_comedy
this was 2004  the first installment and the cheapest which is obvious and the weakest of all three i like good films with excellent and sparkling humor here and there i like brilliant sketches and funny gags this films has almost nothing nothing just a blatant remake of american zombie flicks with a typical englishness added to that  london streets beer id hate beer after watching it so much in three parts pubs horrible dry english accent and tons of silly profanities that add nothing mean little and bring even less simon pegg and co do some decent job here and there but in general this is a very boring overrated and unfunny film with all unnecessary gore blood violence and shooting added to the broth the result a huge shrug of mere disappointment and boredom couldve been much better but big buts remains,black_comedy
is a quite hilarious british bloody comedy that is successfully making fun of romeros zombie film in an appropriate manner the script undeniably delivers few laughs which is the purpose of the film and duo simon peggnick frost are fit to make that happen unfortunately the movie falls short with nonserious issue and idiotic character everything in this movie is only for jokes nothing more than that even they solved the ending also with illogical jokes shaun character is like an unnecessary hero that drag all his relatives into zombies invasion while ed character is too dumb and sometimes annoying overall edgar wrights makes a zombie film less painful than ever with some smart and funny lines but strangely the movie troubled with the joke itself its too nonserious for a zombie film even for a parody and some jokes arent placed in a right time that makes it still few steps behind zombieland,black_comedy
at a time when idiotic unfunny and offensive horror movie spoofs  la scary movie were in prime bloom who would have expected a genuinely amusing parody to come along well probably nobody and even less so in the case of it making fun of the zombie subgenre against all odds however the hilariously talented british comedy trio simon pegg edgar wright and nick frost took a try and did exactly that with the applaudably originalone reason for that is the gory fun refusing to be a stereotypical cinematic spoof and zeroing in on an at least mostly viable plot a storytelling trajectory with an actual start and finish and a realistic and relatable protagonist yet the less positive side of these three arguments also includes that there are a couple of instances of over the top weirdness spontaneous digressions in the central part and clichd supporting roles providing for nothing but laughs and that you wouldnt mind to see served as a midday snack for the undead lurking behind every corner what makes worth watching in the teeth of all these flaws is its dark and referential humour even if the gags dont come at minute intervals and rarely are laugh out loud ones as they in return are subtle ones and sure to maintain their amusement at a repeated watch in addition the film is quite surprisingly superbly made on a technical level making great use of quick and long shots different camera angles multiple forms of lighting and believable bloodshedis far from perfect even when regarded as nothing more but a comedy but has something exciting up its sleeve on every level of filmmaking  the pub shootout accompanied by queens dont stop me now is a truly masterful application of music as a means to improve a scene for example  and is lethally entertaining in every one of its 99 minutes of running time,black_comedy
when it comes to off beat comedies the poms are in a unique league they really know how to make a good comedy and is one of the best watching it for the first time i had no expectations of what to expect and i was not disappointed the plot centered around shaun and his mates trying to get through a zombie apocalypse while still getting to the pub for their pint it had lots of funny moments in it and i can see myself quoting some of the lines for years to come this is one of those movies i will be watching again to catch some of the funnier scenes that i missed the first time like kinky boots which i only watched recently as well this was another surprising english movie highly recommend,black_comedy
anno 2004 talented director edgar wright already proved himself rock solid having made spaced a hilarious tv show that never got the success it deserved and ran from the very late 90s to 2001 starring most of the same actors youll see in but enough back story the question awaiting the release of this movie was of course if wright had enough going for himself to provide the wit his tvseries had for the length of a fullfeature film and he sure did shaun an insanely sarcastic simon pegg and ed two immediately likable slackers who also happen to be best friends live together in a house they rent find themselves face to face with a zombie apocalypse caused by a virus right after shauns girlfriend broke up with him long story short shauns sole target is to get the girl and save his friends and family while still maintaining his charming sense of humour i could ramble on and on about how much i love this movie for all it has going for it but youll just have to discover for yourself think your typical zombiemovie with entertaining yet humble personalities and laughoutloud typically british humour this is the worlds first zomcom and believe me when i say its an absolutely blast,black_comedy
there is more fun in the backgrounds and the foregrounds of the sequences of this movie than the original screenplay this has to be the single reason why it is a great piece of cinema in its new genrecomedy  horror rarely go together unless it is some blownoff horror flick which tickles your bone but shan of the dead is different as it directly jumps into the scene what follows is the survival strategy of a group who are not in good terms with each other human emotions galore as zombies try to eat the sapiensvery strong cinematography pumped with good music makes this a good comedy with all the gore involved the horror is lukewarm performances are absolutely stunning especially by simon pegg  the girl who played his girlfriend zombies did great tooalthough towards halfway the plot does slip into monotony and carries on to induce ennui for some time butt hats forgettablebottom line highly recommended because there are not many movies like it 810can be watched with a typical indian family yesprofanity strong  vulgaritynuditysex no  alcoholsmoking strong  drugsporn no  violencegore infinity,black_comedy
with so much craze about the zombies me and my friend decided to watch something not so new a movie which came out a bit before the zombie fashion we actually had no idea it would turn out this goodthis movie started out slow and if youre thinking during the first fifteen minutes whether or not you should turn it off trust me it gets better we were literally shouting at the screen and couldnt get away from the screen  the movie was a thriller masterpiece and it was not like usual zombie movies or walking dead when people with no fear kill zombies straight away  these were normal people with no plan a lot of fear and a wish to survive so the two friends  shaun and ed decide to round everybody up and hide in their favorite bar until everything cools off good plan right well the plan always sounds good in theory but in practice theres usually a lot of mishapsit is actually interesting how from the beginning shaun shows similarities with zombies  how he gets up from bed his all morning routine is worked out and he does not have to think at all  just follow the schedule life seems simple actually when the zombie fever hits he only notices that when one of them wanders into their yard and even then they think that the girl is just totally wasted and not dead the realization only comes after they think they killed the girl by accident and then she rises up to attack them this is quite scary as it shows how people themselves have become zombies or unaware of their surroundings and their activities that they cant recognize what is going on right in front of their eyes mike rugnetta from pbs idea channel was saying check out his video here  he has great ideas on the zombie topic that the craze for zombies started out as a fear that technologies will take us over and in zombie apocalypse the only thing you can trust is yourself and your skills and that is true as none of the technological wonders like cellphones or computers are really helping out when you need to get away from the zombie horde that is chasing youbut why i loved this movie was because it was funny sad and a thriller at the same time and because of the ending the zombies become a part of the civilization being pets loved ones  or even having jobs as funny as that sounds it is quite scary i mean it is imaginable to be replaced by a machine as civilization grows but can you imagine being replaced by somebody whosalready dead,black_comedy
i have never seen a movie that is more quotable then i watch movies quote movies and let them impact my life in many ways but very few have a greater effect than the title spoofs dawn of the dead but this is nothing like it a zombie movie yes but this is an edgar wright film with simon pegg and nick frost this trio has made some great movies but this is the one that put them on the map an idiot and his friend try to survive the zombie apocalypse by going to their favorite pub the best part of this movie is the little details any fan of the movie can appreciate from the opening credits to the very end everything is connected in the opening credits there is a girl at a cash register and a black guy checking his phone these people return later in the film as zombies maybe you noticed it maybe you didnt but i noticed everything snake hips john his wife the other old lady and even nelson characters we see for three seconds or have two lines come back in some way every line is on purpose and everything is connected the 17 year old kid is the same kid who is frequently calling ed i know everything about anything in the universe for the record dogs can look upi quote movies all the time i have never seen a movie that i quote more than i probably say you got red on you at least a few times a week when i was 17 and somebody asked how old i was i would say 17 just like the kid in the movie in fact whenever i say 17 i say it like that kid in the store every scene has something funny in it through the script the chemistry between nick frost and simon pegg drives this movie they comedically play off each other all the time theres a girl in the garden that entire scene is a riot the throwing of the albums and kitchen objects was great the zombie tackles shaun and ed goes in the house to get a camera i laugh every time since i have seen this movie i call my mom mum instead of mom or mama that is the effect this movie had on me the cinematography and camera angles are also really good the beginning where the camera bounces back and forth between shaun david liz and the other girl was great the scene where shaun and ed are trying to come up with a plan was even better it is little things like the teeth being brushed to the toilet flushing to the pinning of the shaun name tag makes this movie great that and the constant laughs every character in this movie was great i love ed sympathize for shaun understand liz hate david and am annoyed with shauns mum and the other girl i can never remember the name of the story is at times obvious like david being in love with liz and that causing a love triangle between liz him and shaun now throughout the movie i wanted david dead he was so obnoxious all he does is complain and be an idiot but that poor guy did not deserve what he got ed is obviously the best character with laughs from beginning to end he is a guy i would easily get along with and as dumb as he is the friendship he has with shaun is real they have a real brotherhood and i love every second of itbottom line this is a zombie movie a very funny zombie movie but still a zombie movie so that means a few things the zombies the gore and the endgame the zombies in this movie look fantastic and the gore is great when the zombie goes through the pole and her guts go everywhere was unexpected and disturbing but also kind of funny i really hope somebody laughed other than me this movie did get serious as well and had some really emotional moments as well there is one scene that is just so hard to watch and that is the climax with shaun vs david that scene was so well done and watching the chaos was so entertaining is a rollercoaster of laughs but i guess i need to address the big question of is it better than hot fuzz no plain and simple the reason queen that scene when queen comes on the jukebox is one of my favorite scenes in movie history shaun ed and liz are beating the bartender with pool sticks the zombies are trying to get in the fire extinguisher going along with the song everything in this scene worked i can just see the writers laughing over it as they write it and edgar wright directing it with a huge smile overall is a rollercoaster of laughs there is not a single thing i dont like about this movie if i had to choose it would be that it is a british comedy and the accents can be too much and some of the language is hard to understand but who cares it never slows down the laughs never stop and i could watch this every day i watched this movie countless times with an old friend and i suggest you watch this with as many people as possible i have never met a person who has not liked this movie so it has to get the willyt seal of approval when simon pegg nick frost and edgar wright are together expect a seal of approval,black_comedy
this has to be one the most original comedies in years it mixes the genre of horror spectacularly with the comedy with such a depressing subject which has been explored by people such as george a romero its not the first zombie comedy but i do think it is the best the lines are great the irony is clever and each scene leaves you with a smile edgar wright is a brilliant director and i am a fan of his works that ive seen what works in his movies is the characters are so realistic and you can immediately identify with them an example would be ed he is such a jerk but hes the kind of friend youve known forever i think everyone has had this type of friend in their life at one point or another edgar wright also has great symmetry with his movies such displayed early on with two near identical long takes that are just beautiful to behold also nearly every line has a just payoff making the dialogue also very clever the comedy is hilarious the characters are great and the editing is fastpaced and brilliant which leaves this movie impossible to keep your eyes off,black_comedy
shauns nearing 30 stuck in a crappy sales job and his girlfriend liz is unhappy with the amount of time he spends with his ultraslacker b class drug dealer friend ed at their local pub the winchester when liz dumps him shauns so glum he doesnt even realise that londons been overrun with flesheating zombies but somewhere within his consolehappy lazy self a hero is borni cant even begin to emphasise how cool and funny this british film is the amount of time it takes for shaun simon pegg and ed nick frost to realise anythings wrong is genius director edgar wright who cowrote the film with peggdid an amazing job all the timings are bang on and the comedy through out is brillianti could not recommend this film anymore  its a clear 10 from me,black_comedy
is a movie that would please both comedy and horror fans this film had me laughing my brains for the duration of the film there were also some creepy moments as well this movie is the first movie in the trilogy starring simon pegg and nick frost this is the way to start off a comedy trilogythis film is pretty much about some guy his best friend his family and his girlfriend trying to avoid zombiessimon pegg and nick frost have great chemistry they were totally hilarious i was surprised to see bill nighy he also delivered the goods in the filmoverall this is a hilarious horror film but be forewarned most americans will be surprised at the british humor in the film but im sure they will get used to it i rate this film 910,black_comedy
what a film truly one of the funniest british comedies ever made certainly the best romcomzom i have ever seen there are many reasons why it is worth a watch one is the broad range of humour as it combines witty intelligent humour with simple slapstick comedy to make a wide spectrum of humour also meaning it is harder to get bored or find the humour less powerful director edgar wright stylistically gives us a false sense of security as well as the humour surprisingly whilst it is a comedy and one of my favourite funny films off all time and some moments of the film are daft it is more profound than at first glance the power struggles within protagonist shauns life are underrated and it is all about him mainly the relationship with him and his girlfriend liz showed how he struggled in everyday life to cope with keeping her romantically interested with the pressure of his kind of friend david the relationship between him and david shows that he is a decent character as they both wrestle psychologically for liz even though david is in a relationship with dianne whilst the disaster of the zombie outbreak causes his davids character to surface in a negative and he becomes weaker and more resentful shauns character emerges in a more positive way as he steps up to become the leader and hero of his gang the relationship which put most strain on the shaun was his with ed as well as pete shaun struggles to defend ed who is almost blind to what shaun has done for him which leads to shaun doubting his own friendship with ed when pete asks aggressively about why they are so close as friends but the funniest relationship of the film which gave the film a distinct sense of character was the hilarious relationship between ed and shauns mother barbara there was a tentative nature from ed showing his child like mentality and there was something endearing about it as well as it being funny and because she is so funny barbara is the embodiment of the typical british mother so concerned about everyone else as she doesnt want to cause a fuss in a stereotypically british way she offers a different character ark to the usual characters in a zombie film someone so oblivious to what is going on although the lack of response from anyone is also funny particularly the scene when shaun goes down to his local shop and is completely oblivious to the carnage around him and in a typically london argent way goes about his business edgar wrights sense of direction can easily be forgotten but the way he plays around with our expectations of this genre by using miseenscene and sound to make us both scared and make us laugh the media are cleverly employed to spell out to shaun and ed and add their own brand of strange humour and the montage bit it is a clever part of the film to address the zombie issue overall it lacks significant development in plot as well as enough technical features to be considered an absolute classic but still it is a pioneering film which brings a unique and quirky brand of humour with intertextual references to the deer hunter reservoir dogs and the invasion of the bodysnatchers add extra humour to this awesome film and should be watched by all fans of film,black_comedy
let me say this this movie was friking hilarious the characters were well acted and i can say that ed was the most funniest although this movie is very bloody and gory it didnt really freak me out because it was meant in a comical way i can also say that this movie was very touching and sad when all of shauns friends and family died by the zombies this movies plot is very simple it is just about 2 friends who teams up with shauns family and friends to survive the zombie attack i really recommend this movie to comedy fans or horror lovers but i have some concerns about this movie i can say that this movie was very very very short and if it was a little longer it wouldve been a lot better and it ended abruptly but still this movie is very fun so overall 810,black_comedy
is a great film no questions asked its very funny and has great horrora great story and has some excellent acting the first thing i like about this film is how amazingly funny it is although this film may not be that amazing to people who havent watched any of george a romeros zombie films as most of the jokes in this film are spoofy but even if you didnt find this film funny it would still be a great movie not all great films are comedies the second thing i like about this film is the acting almost everyone who has an acting part in this film has played parts in bbcitv dramas or comedies casualty and programmes like that and in they really do their job well the films set in the rough areas of a rough area of england so their are no american actors putting on a stupid english accent and all the actors play their parts very realistically especially ed shauns best friend the story is great in its very clever the way they seem to place shaun and the gang in the same situations as the characters off george romeros films and slip in little jokes you might of watched the film many times before you notice some of these little hidden grenades of laughter and if your a fan of zombie films which you must be really if you want to get the best experience then there is also some violent scenes too so overall this isnt just great film its incredible funny smart and probably the best film of 2004 if you havent seen this film then dont just watch it but buy it and buy dawn of the dead make shore its the 1970s version and watch that before watching this will help you to understand all the jokes this is also a pretty good dvd there are loads of extras for a single disc edition,black_comedy
i watched this film in secret first time round because i wasnt 15 but i didnt care if i was caught because it was the best film i have possibly ever watched the british acting talent in this is great as well as in hot fuzz which ids why i was a bit annoyed when i watched paul because it was filled with americans despite it still being a good film this is my first review so i decided to write it on a film i liked but i am hoping to write more in the future i can actually turn the spoiler alert off because i havent wrote anything about the film apart from it being great please watch this instead of zombieland because as far as romcomzoms go this is the best,black_comedy
if i could say one thing about this film it would be that it is pure comedy goldthe sheer fact that most of the best of british comedy were involved speaks for itself what i cant believe is that this film is not in the top 250 on imdb i mean seriously this is a film that will stand the test of time and that generations and generations will watch this and still laugh at it for years to comeso for all those people reading this review i will firstly applaud you on your choice but mainly i absolutely insist that you rate this the same as i did its a damn shame that this isnt in the top 250 british comedy is an art form that isnt recognised worldwide yet the actors involved in such titles as this very film get involved with big budget american moviesi am indeed british myself and proud too which is why i think that this film deserves to be higher rated than it is right now even if it makes it to 250 i will feel like ive made a difference to the british film industry,black_comedy
as a normal moviegoer i feel as though its rather difficult to find a quality modern horror film a lot of the films you buy tickets to watch today lack originality they dont grip you like some of the classics would they feel void of meaning blasts through all of these barriers providing its own unique approach to the genre engaging you in the plot and provides a meaningful theme that even a lot of classics dont haveits hard to sustain anything other than adrenaline when the focus is on horror alone this is why its not uncommon to see horror films paired with comedy  it induces a little thought into the movie they live american werewolf in london and the holy grail of the combo at least for me army of darkness all employ this tactic successfully extreme cheesiness the likes of which we see in reanimator sometimes works out great and one might expect that in a selfdescribed romantic comedyhorror strangely enough the cheese is absent so what does provide that is unique the peggfrost force plays out great and the subtlety the oneliners the goofiness all fit together perfect and complement the horror the movie delivers on its promise it is a romantic comedy with horror coming second youll get a kick out of the way the issues of basic survival take back seat to the characters concerns for their relationshipsit is these relationships which illustrate the characters above the twodimensional it is a contradiction as a horror movie youre waiting for these characters to be food for a ravenous horde of zombies by the end youre on the edge of your seat to see how the characters relationship problems work themselves out its not enough to scare the crap out of you wouldnt be very funny if it was but it is enough to keep you concernedby the end you can see how the plot works full circle it speaks to the mundaneness of life the main character was not fond of the cycle implied by the banal routines of himself and those around him he was trapped in because it was pushing him away from the person he loves small changes did not help him it required a huge change in order for him to break this routine and possibly reestablish his relationship and this change is practically forced upon him by the disaster he and his friends experience this is true for all the characters as they are able to speak their minds and resolve conflicts in relationships as the movie carries on in a parallel fashion we can look at ourselves and find aspects of our routine that we dislike and cant seem to break out of maybe you tried to quit smoking by smoking fewer and fewer cigarettes each day did you fail try quitting cold turkey taking up exercising and reforming the relationships you have keep those routines that you are fond of and move away right now from all of those which bother youis an excellent funny movie if you havent seen it yet youre seven years behind,black_comedy
much as i loved the simon peggnick frostedgar wright vehicle hot fuzz from 2007 theyre earlier film collaboration 2004 is a hell of a lot funnier for me the main reason that hot fuzz worked was because it was more a great homage to all those 80s90s action movies with a bit of british horror sprinkled in there with many nonstop neat nifty references throughout that reminded me lovingly of those flicks i grew up watching and admiring yes hot fuzz is a comedy and a well done one but at the same time it is definitely more of an homagetributeactionoriented vehicle than it is a comedy whereas falls more into the comedyparody category and a damn funny one at that directed by the supertalented edgar wright shaun stars simon pegg in a hilarious performance that was oscarnomination worthy as the titular hero shaun a lazy unambitious bloke who manages a london electronics store shauns frustrated girlfriend liz the gorgeous and funny kate ashfield implores him to make something of himself and stop hanging around with his even more shiftless best friend ed the eternally hilarious nick frost liz lives with her best friend dianne lucy davis in a wonderful scenestealing performance whose boyfriend david played with stoic solid humor by dylan moran once was in love with liz shauns mum mary gracefully played by penelope wilton is married to phillip vet bill nighy a man that shaun despisesthis eclectic group gets thrown together one crazy day when flesheating zombies is there any other kind overtake london and they must work their way to the local pub which should be safe along the way the group runs into shauns friend yvonne hilarious jessica stevenson and her group an utterly funny scene then before they navigate their way to the pub dianne a wannabe actress gets the group into character acting like zombies to fool the ones blocking the pub once in the pub personal issues come to a boiling point that coincides with the groups chaotic situation just like in any disaster filmwhat amazed me about shaun was how fastpaced it is it almost plays like an action movie once the zombie attack starts the film never really slows down and when it takes time for characters to confront each other it never loses sight of the severity of the situation and in come the zombies the humor is dead solid perfect especially the way the characters naturally react to their undead attackers and use their wits what little they have to overcome the situationironically although im a sucker for horrorslasher flicks the zombie subgenre is the one that i like the least im more into the psycho killer type flicks but shaun is just so funny that it won me over shaun blows the doors off the much ballyhooed overrated remake of dawn of the dead which came out the same year and slowed down to the point of being a total bore and also had less talented actors in it than shaun does shaun is about as funny as real comedy gets,black_comedy
this is often marketed as a parody to romeros dawn of the dead but its so much more than that the clever writing makes this a movie with many layers first of all its of course a brilliant pileup of genre clichs and nods to the source material its been three days since i watched this movie and im still unbelievably amused by were coming to get you barbara then its a straightforward laughoutloud comedy my favourite moment in the entire movie is when they try to kill a couple of zombies by throwing lps through their faces that scene was already in the theatre trailer so i must have seen it countless times by now but it still gets me every time surprisingly this movie also has some good straightup horror value i really didnt expect this to be so gory the cartoon violence is definitely a plus and fits right in i also liked how i actually cared about which characters lived and which characters died for a change thats pretty rare in recent horror efforts so it was unexpected to find this quality in of all things long story short is effing awesome,black_comedy
its good not brilliant im not really a simon pegg or nick frost fan this film is funny and worth the watch it just isnt the kind of film that will leave you mesmerised even though im not a fan of simon pegg i am looking forward to seeing him in the new star trek film i want to see the boat that rocked with nick frost in so the comedy duo aint all that bad but i just didnt find this film to be as amazing as everyone else thinks the story takes place in england and basically theres an infection and everyone but pegg frost and some others are infected becoming blood thirsty zombies so its a funny fight for survival film theres not really much else to tell about this film if you feel like watching a film for a good laugh then this is right up your street its worth a watch if you havent seen it 610jd seaton,black_comedy
i was very surprised by how much i loved this movie throughout the past few years every once in a while something by simon pegg edgar wright and nick frost others including spaced and hot fuzz which i will see very soon caught my attention but never enough to make me buy it since i saw it for a very low price i took a chance ill never regret this movie was a terribly fun homage to zombie flicks mainly the romero trilogy and horror films in general mixing in a very unique brand of comedy only these people could make this movie easily takes a twist from a horrorcomedy to a dramahorror and back to a comedy less of a horror this may sound like a very harmless horror flick but some violence gets very graphic one of which is a homage to both dawn and day of the dead overall watch this movie for its a lot of fun,black_comedy
ah those epic zombie gore dramacomedies such a great genre of film i absolutely loved last years hot fuzz so it was a given that i would have to check out this one too and oh man it did not disappointis a film that transcends genres and forces you to roll with it as it jettisons through a huge romp full of humor blood n guts and some downright tearjerking moments that honestly surprised me given the lighthearted nature of hot fuzz this is not a stupid movie as it knows what it is doing and does it well all of the jokes are well placed and brilliantly timed and everything ties together in the way youd expect  but that doesnt make the ride any less glorious superb film,black_comedy
when i was browsing my local dvdstore for other films i saw the cover for at first i looked at the cover for a while but decided not to buy it then it started to haunt me something told me i had to buy it so two weeks later i didi had never heard of the film at the time so i didnt expect much there is no better mindstate than not expecting much when you watch this film because it blew me awaythe comedy part of this film is so ingenious i would compare it to the cleverness of say monthy python combined with more conventional comedy types i have watched this film many times now and still i discover new details that are sometimes hard to notice but are so clever you have to smirk when you see them it actually challenges you to look for easter eggs the zombie part was gory enough to please romero fans and horror junkies but it never gets cheap the zombies are convincing enough and thank god slow moving moaners as i really dont like running zombiesthe following is not meant to be insulting or anything but you have to be somewhat of a thinker to watch this and enjoy it some of my friends didnt like this film at all because they didnt get some of the jokes with that said if you havent seen it go watch it asap,black_comedy
dont get me wrong this film is alright but it is far from brilliant and i have no idea how it picked up its hype and highstar ratingsits a nice comedy but making the imdb top 250 pleaseis similar to most zombie movies youve probably seen before with the twist of being more of a comedyspoof and less of frighthorrorgore movie and while it does get some laughs out it never reaches dropdead funny cult classic only if you consider any zombie flick an automatic cult classiczombie films are a popular genre so popular in fact that the multitude of zombie films out there could be cataloged into subgenres this one goes straight into the makesanicedvdrentalwhenyouvegotnothingbettertodo zombie genre which is probably the most wellstacked shelf at your local video rental store,black_comedy
as far as romantic zombie comedies go is the best of the genre what its the only one of its genre no way but thats where excels its original its audacious its hilarious the funniest zombie movie intentionally funny at that most zombie horrors take themselves far too seriously and pokes fun at them every step of the way the script is an absolute cracker the cast not one of them can be faulted are uniformly excellent bill nighy has great fun in a relatively minor role and adds weight to the film i saw it and promptly went out and bought it on dvd so that i can enjoy it over and over again the soundtrack is best of british one scene in particular with queens dont stop me now is absolutely inspired a british comedy masterpiece,black_comedy

has been dubbed a zomromcom meaning a romantic comedy featuring zombies yet it really works only in terms of the zombies and there less on its own merits than in the way it channels famous past films about the undead it was amusing at times impressive but never engagingshaun simon pegg works a london electronics store his life as dull and pointless as any other in his sad city his main problem is reconciling his responsibilities with girlfriend liz kate ashfield with his other longterm relationship involving layabout buddy ed nick frostthings will change i promise shaun tells liz he soon discovers how right he is after bumping into assorted people with shuffling walks deadeyed stares and a tendency as shauns mother puts it to get a bit biteywritten by pegg and director edgar wright is less a sendup than a celebration of the zombiefilm culture playing the comedy less in the manner of a mel brooks spoof and more in a way that respects the whole notion of zombies appearing in ones world attacking loved ones the laughs come as much from shaun and eds deadpan reactions and the films way of teasing the audience with allusions both to other zombie films and to the british television work of the films starsthats too many injokes for me not to mention a singular lack of charisma by any of the films principals if not as deliberately offputting as the work of other british comedians like sasha cohen and ricky gervais theres a strong whiff of au currant kitchensink misery to shaun that deadens a lot of the pleasure to be had ironically shaun was shot in part at ealing studios making it an ealing comedy though of a different kind than alec guinness would have knownbut thats my cultural take from someone admittedly not a part of that culture im over 40 and this film was not made for me fair enough does shaun work on its own terms at timesmostly it works as a fairly involving zombie film with real violence and some comic relief not as lovable as return of the living dead or as clever as evil dead 2 it nevertheless keeps things moving and has a good narrative arc all the way to the final big scene a showdown at shauns favorite bar that rivals the alamo sequence in saving pvt ryan for desperate intensity there the three principals and their companions must stave off a wave of zombies and the buildup gives otherwise lame ideas like a poolcue beatdown in time to queens dont stop me now a real liftif only i cared enough about the characters to fret over their horrible fates good zombie films manage some emotional remove and shaun does too but that works too often at the expense of the rom and the com pegg and ashfield play well off one another and theres a fine turn by bill nighy as shauns unloved fatherinlaw but i quickly tired of ed and found myself at times bemoaning the zombies slowfootednessan okay movie that could have been better shaun works at times on its own selfreferential terms but when people werent getting killed i wasnt laughing thats a strange thing to have to say about a comedy,black_comedy
treats itself the same as the zombies it features does itself in with a blow to the brain for onehalf to threequarters of an hour its an observant and inventive comedy about a meek clumsy loser played and shot with much originality so much that it sometimes skirts incomprehensibility one can still work out whats going on the big fault in this section of the film is the sameness of it the jokes all have a nearly identical tone and substance its all really one long joke about the heros schmoiness and so eventually it becomes rather tiresome in the manner of the tv series the office it doesnt go anywhere doesnt developbut soon we find out the filmmakers didnt mean it to its all been a setup for what they really have it in mind to bring us which turns out to be a parody of george romeros zombie movies this is a letdown at first if one was interested in seeing where the characters lives were heading and then it becomes a retardant the longer it continues the shorter a distance the script has to go and the less it has to say until by the end its stopped going anywhere or saying anything a parody of the romero movies was unnecessary they were already parodies of themselves and had exhausted the possible variations in zombiebashing slapstick by now an old and stupid trick im not high on comic gore anyhow i dont find pain and death funny but on this occasion i especially resented its taking over it got the movie in the head too,black_comedy

anticipating the release of hot fuzz has made me want to see the simon peggedgar wright career works having heard how great the uk series spaced was i bought an import from britain and just recently finished it the show was great pop culture abounds hilarity from start to finish and much like the office they knew when to stop and not let the show take a fall with filler and repetitioncoughus the officecough what better segway from those two seasons then to go right on to the crews first feature film now i own a lot of movies on dvd and as a result dont get to watch them often and in some instances have never seen them yet however i must have watched shaun four or five times in the past three years i find the humor great and the characters well fleshed out and just having a blast with each other it never gets tiring for medirector edgar wright shows the ability to appropriate camera shots from other films like he did with the numerous homage moments in spaced and also a deft handling of the medium especially with the long one take of shaun walking into the convenience store both times the way he was able to recreate shots and moments from the beginning of the film to later on is effective and funny its good to see that he has kept a working relationship with writeractor simon pegg because the two go together brilliantly pegg cowrote and starred in spaced with jessica stevenson included in shaun with a small role pegg is naturally charismatic and has perfect comedic timing throughouthelped im sure by the fact he is usually playing against best friend in real life nick frost the thing with simon pegg is that he isnt your usual comedian trying to show range the guy really can act he plays the serious moments with the right amount of emotion and reality and his expressions are always true to the moment sure the physical comedy is there but his characters always work so well without the gimmicks that when the slapstick comes it actually workswright and pegg have definitely stamped themselves all over this film using their influences and love of the horror and comic genres they have created a monster that stands all on its own equal parts spoof and real zombie scareer is a genre masterpiece breathing new life into a type of film which has been stale and redundant for the past decade or so besides the great 28 days later which has a shot taken at it here besides the need for survival amongst the living dead though we also have shauns quest to become a man and sort out his priorities the most important being getting his girlfriend liz back the fusion of this common romantic comedy plot device and its polar opposite with horror works surprisingly well both in the script and the acting whereas most horror films just make you bide time as each character is taken out one by one we are treated here with a group of friends that truly care for each other and meet fate together rather than alone these people know the genre and never stupidly go into a situation to conveniently be killedthe humor could never have been as successful as it was without some spectacular actors kate ashfield as shauns girlfriend liz really adds depth to the film playing the straight character to the many goofballs running around im not familiar with anything else she has done but i would assume it is mostly serious stuff as she is one of the few here not playing for laughs penelope wilton is perfect as shauns mother and peter serafinowicz once again shows how he excels at playing pricks like his spaced character also like so many films of this ilk we need to have the token serious actor to give it some credibility bill nighy is that person here and he definitely adds professionalism while fitting in naturally with the crazy castwhile this is wright and peggs film they never could have done it without the help of nick frost for being a regular guy and best bud to pegg while he was starting out in the industry frost landed an integral role in spaced on the behest of his friend pegg wrote into the series a character based on one of frosts personas that he would do to get laughs knowing no one could do the role better he got nick into the show despite him having no acting background whatsoever it was a fantastic move because he is a natural and in shaun shows the maturity and growth he has undergone the guy is a fullfledged actor now and steals every scene he is in while never being just a copy of his tv role frost has range and one of the best deliveries for comedic gems the few times when the film started to lull frost was always there to save the day having a familiar rapport with pegg also helps us believe their relationship and understand the two and where they are coming from i cant wait to see what the wrightpeggfrost trio can do to the buddy cop genre with this years hot fuzz if the trailers have anything to say about it it should be on par with spaced and shaun if not exceed them both,black_comedy
this great comedy amusingly described by the poster as a romantic comedy with zombies comes courtesy of the crew who also gave us the excellent tv series spaced to be honest the film can feel like a tv episode that has been stretched out and this would probably be a problem if the film wasnt so damned funny it may be lowbudget but this is a film which is to be watched for the gags almost as if the zombies were mere coincidence in the story with the simple premise that shaun is a loser who is virtually a zombie stumbling through his life and who has just been dumped by his girlfriend suddenly finds himself the only one capable of saving his few friends when zombies take over theres a fantastic scene where shaun is walking to the local shop and back whilst in the background you see the zombies taking over all the while without shaun noticing its simple yet remarkably effective the story is all in the writing and it certainly shows shauns first reaction to seeing a zombie is priceless oh my god shes so drunk and his best friend ed nick frost is definitely worth a mention as the only person who is more of a loser in life than shaun the film does begin to stall whenever they attempt a serious bit but the jokes are flowing like the beer in the winchester pub they are trying to reach its not a particularly gory film only in one scene towards the end does it get a bit bloody but the film succeeds so well because it proves that it doesnt have to be gory to get attention this one is definitely worth a few viewings  you will not be disappointed rated 8510more reviews at httpwwwthelazyloungenet,black_comedy
oh yes despite my criticism of said movie i rather enjoyed it and i will say an 8 is a high ranking for a snooty individual such as myself see my other rants about aliens titanic and i think i did one about gladiator but thats neither here nor there i am a sappy horror struck individual who loves the zombie related i think i orgasmed the first time i played resident evil and this movie gave me my zombie fix oh yes delightful and yes it was indeed a romantic comedy but somewhere along the line it stopped being a comedy at all was it when he had to kill his mother or when they were trapped in the basement of the pub and ed was begging for his death i couldnt tell you but somehow somewhen it slid out of the comedy genre and into the realm of drama i was distraught where was the lighthearted witty banter the comic smashing of records against a zombie head by the by ruining a perfectly good dire straits record but i digress this was real acting i felt bad i was sad for shaun i felt despair and hopelessness these are not feelings a romantic comedy brings to me somewhere along the line the movie switched from being a spoofromcom into a serious piece of filmmaking dont get me wrong the actors had chops oh man did they have chops the scene where shaun turns the gun on his mother i almost cried i empathized with him so but i dont know that something that heavy has a place in romantic comedy or even romantic zombedy so i must sigh and rate this fine piece of work an 8 instead of a 10 and declare it a 7 movie a movie i would purchase were i to see it for 699 or so but no more worth seeing mayhaps even worth buying if only to have amidst your collection but not a true and sparkling gem,black_comedy
what do you do when zombies attack throw sade records at them of course if you cant kill them at least youll put them to sleep so begins the first line of defense against the undead in edgar wrights sometimes cheeky often sentimental zombie flickthe film stars simon pegg as shaun a loser who decides its time to take control of his life and relationships just as the world happens to be suddenly overrun by the living dead it also stars kate ashfield as liz his girlfriend who wants more than endless nights at the local pub and nick frost as ed shauns long time best friend whose crude nature rightfully annoys those around shaun the story begins with liz expressing her concern over her relationship with shaun they spend their evenings at the winchester a local pub of questionable repute liz is ready for shaun to grow up a little and for the next phase in their lives together shaun fails to prove his commitment to change and liz decides its time to move on just before zombies overrun the world heartwarming hilarity ensues as shaun begins to finally show his resolve and rescue his close friends and family from the undead thematically one of the films central insights shows that those who resign themselves to apathy may as well be dead or in this case undead this theme is particularly evident in a climatic scene where shaun and the remaining members of his group are barricaded in the winchester shauns mother barbara reveals that shes been bitten by a zombie and dies david shauns antagonist and friend of liz berates shaun and cruelly tells him to kill his mother his apathy enrages shaun who punches him after killing his zombified mother the director edgar wright uses a high angle shot to catch davids reaction further emphasizing davids cowardly and low nature before david has a chance to fully come to terms with his apathetic nature and apologize to shaun zombies abduct him illustrating the theme of apathy being a kind of death wright employs other film elements throughout the picture that may support this theme as well for example prior to the zombie invasion shaun and ed say youre dead or the next time i see him hes dead in a youreagoner manner to several other characters in the film who each turn into zombies later this small ironic motif may be wrights way of further illustrating shauns perception of others apathy of course this review would be remiss without mentioning george romeros dawn of the dead a cult classic that also makes similar social commentary as zombies roam the american shopping mall in search of flesh brains and the best sales in town while wrights shaun is a more tongueincheek approach the similarities are clear and there are numerous subtle references to romeros work throughout is not a typical horror parody nor is it a typical romantic comedy by utilizing different film elements wright actually makes a clever social commentary defying the horror genre by incorporating elements of comedy and romance proves many times over that apathy is perhaps the most unfortunate living death,black_comedy
many fans view the night of the living dead as one of the greatest horror films of all time because of that status this irreverent take on the inside jokes situations and characters of notld has brought this work to immediate cult statusmany reviewers have painfully detailed each and every reference to notld to be found in shawn of the dead but the entire film is an homage to that which it spoofs george romeros lowbudget sleeper hit film of the late 1960s why then would anyone feel the need every scene every detail is homagicif you love the zombie genre this one is a definite mustseeit rates an 8410 fromthe fiend ,black_comedy
i saw this not to long ago and i can safely say that it is not funny but hilarious is an excellent parody of dawn of the dead and night of the living dead shaun is your average british guy who lives with a friend that mooches off of him ed and a girlfriend who just broke up with him liz and a mom who has a very distant relationship with him barbara during one odd day shaun and ed notice that the townspeople seem to be staggering and groaning weird it becomes weirder when they start biting and even weirder when the news starts warning people to stay inside their houses because the townspeople have turned into zombiesthe film is wellknown for being funny apparently shauns dry wit of the situation makes the viewers able to laugh my friend and i had to replay the scene where shaun encounters a zombie and makes a bit of a song with him it was that funny the other scenes arent as funny but still worth a decent laugh shaun certainly provides the silliness needed to pull of big laughs i also thought the sense of irony made it funnydavid while shaun is off fighting zombies and whats shauns big plan sitting around in the dark eating peanuts shaun perhaps ten minutes later would anybody like a peanut aside from that the film is also a good horror and thriller yes it is a comedy but it isnt a comedy so silly that it messes up the story line just to get a decent laugh the story is the same as night of the living dead except perhaps a bit sillier who says parodies cant be thrilling i also thought it could qualify as a drama various scenes of death and revealed secrets make it fairly emotional zombies eating and killing everybody doesnt exactly make you feel good the characters slightly fall apart as emotions take over logic which causes the characters to need to pull together and fight harder in the situationthere were two main flaws in the movie the first is that it may be way too gory for some people yes it is a zombie movie but is viewing somebodys insides fully necessary the second one is that the film lessens as a comedy and becomes more of a drama during the part when the group enters the pub it takes away some of the lighthearted tone and takes a more serious tone i do like drama but that was kind of disappointing for me because i really loved the witty comedic moments had to offernone of the jokes are overdrawn or too stupid to prevent a laugh they come by the minute each one funnier then the next it really made my day8510 good funny lighthearted witty and makes a decent horror thriller and comedy bad its pretty gory and seems to put an emphasis on horror and drama halfway through the film which decreases its comedic level,black_comedy
the recent surge of horror remakes has been replete with glossy flashy movies full of generic scores mixed with meaningless numetal music unoriginal story lines carnage suitable only for cookiecutter teen audiences and the problem of taking themselves all too seriously whats happened to the inventive darkly funny horror films of yesteryear such as the evil dead and dead alive hollywood has all but forgotten what once made horror films great but it seems that the uk is out to remind them first with 28 days later a film that put a new spin on the zombie genre and now with a hilarious romantic zombie comedy or romzomcomis about well shaun pegg a man who is at a crossroads in his life he works a deadend job he lives with his slob of a best friend ed frost and he was just dumped by his girlfriend of three years liz ashfield in the midst of trying to sort all of this out a zombie epidemic just happens to break out and this only exacerbates things for himright from the first frame we get the feeling that this is a thoroughly complete horror comedy as right away it features the goblins score for the original dawn of the dead the references to classic horror films and filmmakers just flow and flow constantly as the film gives a nod to everything from romeros dead series obviously to the evil dead to lucio fulci the way the film approaches the zombie invasion is extremely clever and wellhandled featuring several brilliant sequences one of which shows shaun routinely walking the streets of london on a perfectly average morning and then walking them again on the morning of the undead or dare i say it the dawn of the dead insert eyeroll here without even noticing the difference but what really makes the film outstanding is not just the horror element but the fact that this would be a hysterical and wonderful film even without the zombie twist the acting is excellent especially from simon pegg who delivers gags with perfect comic timing pulls off heated confrontations expertly and even nails the films demanding emotional scenes including a scene where he is forced to shoot his own zombified mothernot only does the film keep the laughs and the inventiveness flowing but it also delivers what so many of the sleek hollywood horror remakes of late have been forgetting gore its complete with squirting blood gushing bites headshots and even a disembowling also the ending though something of a deux es machina is still extremely inventive and is most certainly a crowd pleaseredward wright cowriterdirector and simon pegg cowriter have delivered a film that will satisfy the demands of horror purists romantic comedy fans and just about every other kind of moviegoer there is except for maybe the teens that are in love with the grudge and dawn of the dead 2004 for it is truly a film that doesnt forget any of the elements of a great horror movie comedy or drama910,black_comedy
this is a great movie i hold this up to the likes of monty python it is one of the best spoofs i have seen in years ed is a great character funny as hell just the way it was made was genius i couldnt stop laughing they did a great job with the zombies to the effects were very good as well that one scene where david is yanked out of westchester and is torn open by the zombies actually looked really good tosing the old records at the zombies beating them with cricket bats genius in the end everyone uses zombies for everyday tasks on the game show and the jerry springer spoof i loved every minute of it 810 british humor at its best,black_comedy
i loved this movie zombie movies are fun enough when they are serious and scary but this was laugh out loud funny it is however not just a parody of zombie movies but a funny romantic comedy that gets many of its laughs from the relationships between characters if every instance of walking dead people were excised from the film it would still be a fine film the main character shaun experiences much that is familiar to young people who have gotten too old for school but have yet to settle down he has a girlfriend who wants more out of life a couple of roommates who alternate between slovenly and uptight and a boring dead end job his girl doesnt get on with his best friend and he isnt exactly fond of her friends he is determined to resolve all of these differences and still tries even when it seems that the dead have risen and start to terrorize the living if youve ever had a dysfunctional family or a fight with your girlfriend or boyfriend you will relate to the characters if you like zombie movies look for the constant though sometimes very subtle references to every zombie movie that has ever come before highly recommended for fans of british comedy romantic comedy nuts and devotees of zombie cinema,black_comedy
was simply one of the best films of 2004 and one of the best zombie films ever to be put to celluloid everything in the movies works the acting is top notch without relying on any big hollywood heavyweights well at least not big names to us uncultured american swine the special effectsmake up were great too all the zombies look pretty convincing not that ive had the misfortune of ever meeting a real zombie edgar wright and simon peggs script is what really carries the film the cyclical nature of the dialogue the subtle references to other films and the flat out funny moments elevate this movie from a standard zombie film to a movie unique among its genre the overall running length of the film about 100 minutes is essentially faultless the film is long enough to tell a complete logically flowing selfcontained story but short enough to never drag wrights discreet direction adds another dimension to the film with everyone minor character or event returning or being referenced at one point another also doesnt lose appeal in repeated viewings if anything it strengthens the movie a small detail for example eds phone call in the first scene at shaun pete and eds house and the conversation the kid has on his phone at shauns work place could be overlooked quite easily the first time around became an instant cultclassic in the states upon its limited release in theaters and will probably stay that way but deservedly so while i havent found anyone i know personally who dislikes the movie its understandable why it didnt have major boxoffice appeal british film satirizingmaking a homage to a particular niche of the moviegoing audience isnt exactly financial gold overall if you like comedy and like zombies see this movie now even if youve seen it see it again,black_comedy
although some may see this movie as silly and stupid it is a comic great destined to be a cult classic theres nothing better than a cult classic right well this movie has many jokes that have to be thought about to seem funny although eds shauns friend fart is well timed and a quite funny fart joke in the first place you have to realize that he cut the cheese in the middle of a zombie invasion when death is practically imminent eds inconsiderance for this fact is really what makes it flat out hilariousone of the better jokes that kind of runs throughout the entire movie is that no one knows why it happened and in the end shauns girlfriend changes the channel on the tv right as you are about to find out thats funny toosean pegg is a very good actor in this film because he captures the little things in every day life the way he twitches his fingers when hes talking to his girlfriend about breaking up the way he forces you to believe that his girlfriend still likes himself just like he forces his own self to believe that fact and his dazed look on his face while hes showing tv channels to his customers are all very well done he has done work extending to hbos miniseries band of brothers look that up and worked on spaced in case you already didnt know thatthe end of the movie loses its humor as shaun is forced to make some very difficult decisions regarding his mothers life and leaving his best friend behind but the humor gets injected back into the movie in little increments like the point where shaun contemplates how he would kill himself and his girlfriendall in all this is my 2nd favorite movie of all time topped only by pulp fiction i know that may seem like a stretch but for me this is the perfect movie,black_comedy
meet shaun his girlfriend just broke up with him his flatmate is a slob he forgot to get his mom flowers he cant make peace with his step dad and to top it all off the world has been over populated with zombies now to save his life and his relationship with everyone around him shaun and his flatmate friend ed must go up against blood thirsty zombies save him mom make peace with his step dad save his girlfriend liz and hold up in a near by pub with the safety of a cricket batis a instant classic youll love the mix of horror and comedy along with the sad family issues aside from the jokes is the gore thats right gore in a zombie love story spoilers gory parts include when david gets grabbed by thousands of zombies outside the pub and gets ripped apart a homage to day of the dead shaun blowing zombies heads open with a gun shaun getting a dart in the headouch and so on the acting is done quite well and youll love the assortment of characters you got the everyday loser shaun the slob flatmate ed the pretty girlfriend liz shauns caring mother barbra the take charge and stern step dad phillip and so on youll start laughing just at the first shot a zoom in on shauns face get a riot from the garden sequence with zombies mary and the hulk the queen sequence white lines acting as zombies to get to the pub falling over a fence oh i could go on for hours now do yourselves a favor and go see this movie you wont regret it,black_comedy
this was one of the best movies i saw in the last year or two the acting was good the plot was fairly well thought out and it was very funny it helps if you are a zombie movieie g romerofan and enjoy british type humorlike the monty python troupe but if you are neither it will not stop you from enjoying this movie it is a weird mix of several genrescoming of age buddy movie comedy love horrorbut it definitely works on all levels the main charactersshaun and edwill definitely remind you of some slacker you knewor know the facial expressions dialogue and general behavior of these two make for some of the best scenes in the movie there are also some very good makeup effects and a decent amount of gore this is definitely one worth owning,black_comedy
my screen writing professor had us watch this in class one day because it followed the jack epps style of writing the title put me off i thought i would have to be subject to another cheesy horror film that i was forced to watch by my older siblings when i was a kid but i was pleasantly surprisedi liked this movie for its roundabout british humor and the zombie action i have watched many british films and shows and so i understood a lot the humor whereas my fellow classmates were lostshauns character is hilarious i like that he is almost 30 and still lives in a flat with his friend from university but then has his best friend who is practically a schlep and goes on shauns dates with liz i liked shauns mum as she was trying to not get into the way the step dad cracks me up with his rigid ways and then trying to keep the jag all nice and neat while driving through london throughout zdayoverall this movie has great humor and makes great impressions of the zombies i wasnt put off by their actions in this film as they can be absolutely annoying in other films i would watch this any day to keep my spirits up,black_comedy
i loved this movie the characters were rich and funny the cinematography was excellent the pacing was quick there are jokes that i didnt get the first time through but i did the secondit is a touching story about relationships buddies girlfriends parents stepparents its about getting up off your couch and doing what needs to be donewith all that being said it is a zombie movie there are blood and guts and people being torn limb from limb and shot and splattered if youre not a fan of horror movies do not go in expecting an adam sandler romantic comedyits a horror romantic comedy it is great,black_comedy
the movie is a great british comedy that deals with the every day pressures of one man shaun simon pegg and the inconvenience of his town inhabited with zombies unlike the scary movie series this movie is actually funny the story surrounds shaun and his best friend ed who take it in their own hands to destroy the zombies living in their town pick up shauns ex and mother and get to the pub for a pint of beer like i said before this movie was way better than what i expected the actors are funny the script is smart for a zombie movie id recommend this movie to any one who is interested in british comedy,black_comedy
this movie offers plenty of laughs for the most part and is a very enjoyable zombie spoof movie not quite as good though as peter jacksons dead alive it still offers plenty to the viewer to see and laugh about this movie is about a guy going through romantic problems and other problems as well such as a dead end job and two other roommates that are on opposite ends of the spectrum causing headaches for our hero while all these mundane things are going on there are numerous reports of strange happenings being announced but our hero just switches the channel or ignores it and is completely oblivious to the fact zombies are going on a rampage it is a bit of a slow set up but it is funny watching him totally unaware of the fact people are being killed then the zombies attack in full force and the movie really picks up unfortunately some times in the movie it seems to be an airplane type spoof then in the next turn it gets a wee bit too serious for its own good these scenes just dont seem to fit in with the rest of the movie however it does not deter from the movie all that much and in the end it is very much a comedy first romance second and horror a distant third some rather nice zombie effects here and there as there is a scene where a zombie falls on a pipe and another person gets pulled apart but for the most part it is not a gore fest in fact in scenes where people do get killed it seems a bit out of place seeing how light hearted the movie is at times worth a look and worth more than a couple of laughs,black_comedy
this is a zombie film spoof and there have been plenty of those before but this one is a bit different its different in the sense that its not quite as goofy as others like the notable evil dead series and peter jacksons excellent dead alive this one is played with a pretty dry sense of humor shaun is a pretty regular guy who is supposed to lead this whole group of people to safety in the face of a zombie invasion there are some funny gags i especially liked when shaun left his house and walked to his car not even noticing the zombies sorry no change the plot involving several girlfriends works well enough to propel the story though it isnt really explained why all these other people join him in his strange quest to get to the local pub as if that represents safety and security shaun resembles homer simpson in this respecti think this one will be remembered by a small group that loves it but for most people this will pass in one ear and out the other,black_comedy
directed by edgar wright presents us the tale of shaun simon pegg who also cowrote the script who is an average joe living in london who has your normal run of the mill problems he has an unsatisfying job girlfriend troubles no one gets along with his best friend ed the hilarious nick frost and zombies are hunting him he not only has to try to survive the day being surrounded by them but has to protect his friends and some of his family while trying to defeat the living dead for a guy who is very content to live his life in a rut this proves to be quite a challengeluckily the jokes in are a hell of a lot funnier than my summary line for this review i cannot remember the last time i laughed so hard and so much at a film that didnt have anything to do with the coen brothers not only is the humor in about as dark as it gets but there are such witty moments that i was left shaking my head at the brilliance of the script there are several moments where the humor is subtle yet uproariously funny a good example is when shaun wakes up the morning the zombies have taken over and incredibly hung over walks in a daze to the corner convenience store he doesnt notice that there are huge bloody hand prints on the cooler door then suddenly slips on something the audience doesnt see but assumes is some kind of blood or gore this could have gone two other ways  either he wouldnt slip at all or we would see what he slips on but the way it was presented made it one of the many times i found myself crying from laughing so hard simon pegg and nick frost are also absolutely brilliant as best friends and our main protagonists their fantastic and natural acting coupled with the real feel of the dialogue made for some truly standout performances i am not familiar with either actor but if they are not already stars this is surely their breakout filmthe only criticism i have of the film is something that i may have even missed with all of my laughter  i have no idea why there was this sudden plague of the living dead for a film as entertaining as this one however that kind of explanation is something that really isnt necessary something that i am normally a stickler for there were also some unexpected poignant moments that seemed out of place but none of these criticisms diminished the overall effect the film had on me i so thoroughly enjoyed this film that it is disappointing to say that this is not a film for everyone make no mistake is at times extremely violent and quite gory and its blackest of black humor is not going to appeal to many but if you want to see a brilliant comedy that is going to make you cringe while making you laugh out loud this is your movie i havent had this much fun at the movies in a long timeshelly,black_comedy
listen i know how it is sometimes when you go out to the movies you wanna laugh sometimes you wanna watch two nice people fall in love and if youre like me you wanna watch zombies rip people apart but sometimes when you go to the movies dont you just long to see a romantic comedy in which zombies rip people apart fear not reader is the film for youfollows our hero shaun simon pegg 24 hour party people on journey to win back his girl liz lucy davis tvs the office make amends with his mom nicola cunningham and to fight off a small london suburb of zombies shaun enlists the help of his slacker best friend ed nick frost tvs spaced and dianne lucy davis tvs the office and david dylan moran notting hill lizs two best friends who dont seem to like shaun very much but they follow him anyway cause liz follows shaun its all very complicated but once you let the characters take hold this film is a tripdirector edgar wright tvs spaced has crafted a silly and yet surprisingly rich film full of characters worth rooting for gore that harkens back to a simpler time when it was okay to disembowel in horror flicks and conflicts that enlighten our characters with humanity its a film about how mundane and zombielike our lives are and about our search for that hero inside but more importantly the film is about being funny laugh out loud guttbusting funnypeggs shaun hits the right chords as a guy who wants more out of his life but is drawn back into his slacker existence because he doesnt know any better hes every tom dick and harry who looks at themselves 10 years after graduating from college and wondering how did i get here thats easy hes been sticking up for a buddy who has as much drive as a broken down ford pinto and thats what makes him a great hero hes empathetic to a faultbut most are probably wondering what about the zombies works because the screenplay loves the material as screenwriters as wellpegg and wright dont allow the material to become mean spirited they love the zombie movie ill bet they sat up many late nights watching night of the living dead and dawn of the dead over and over theres even a small wink at 28 days later wont fall on deaf ears they know the material well and walk the thin line between spoof and homage to a nice degreethe best scene in the film concerns one characters death by being bitten by a zombie nobody wants to shoot that character who will eventually become one of the undead and theyre torn on both sides a showdown of broken bottles and a corkscrew tests the characters will and in the end brings them closer together the scene works because there is real tension although this is a comedy these characters are in peril it was exhilaratingthe films only major flaw is that it takes far too long to get started the first twenty minutes drag on like they were being paid by the minute the laughs at the beginning seemed to be forced and if id left before the zombies begin to show up i might have panned the movie as boring but once the zombies show up the film comes to life with really good laughs and even a few good scares chucked in for measure would have done well to have had the early moments of the film reimagined or shaved a little but ill forgive the film this one small flaw i really liked itat the end of the day though the most surprising thing about is what its not its not a horror film its a romantic comedy turned on its head and it works almost flawlessly in fact my wife called it forces of nature with zombies instead of weather i dont know if id go that far but i will agree that there is a little romance for the lady in your life if youre looking for something a little different if youre looking for a silly movie with heart or you like to watch people get ripped apart limb from limb does not disappoint i promise youll like it12 out of 5,black_comedy
but gets a bit sluggish towards the end i have this issue with many movies  too long shuan starts off great funny stuff good special effects  nice plot the firs 34th of this film is excellent i laughed out loud several timesbut when they are baracaded in the tavern  it is legitimately about 1520 minutes too much the laughter slows to a tricklethe ending is good so you have a great flick and a good ending sandwiching 15 minutes of blandness not bad for a film these days though i give shaun a 6 i also hope there is a sequel where they take my advice,black_comedy
i wish i could recommend this movie but i can not i wish i could comment on how awful this movie is but words fail me i really dont know which is worse the overrated british sense of humor or their world worldclass horrible cuisine i pass on eitherkumar goes to white castle is finally off the hook as the lamest movie to be released in 2004 in fact if there is a category for lamest foreign movie at the oscars next year sotd should win hands down although it may be to soon to say since there are 3 months left in the current year and i can see a few more stinkers on the horizon 12 start out of  and thats for having the balls to release this in the states,black_comedy
i dont know what else to say but the summary the movie is good but unfortionatly its not really unique and has been done before still good for a laugh the acting is good and there are some pretty nice filming which seperates the movie a bit from others however some splatter films come to mind such as braindead and from dusk till dawnmost of the scenes in the beginning is where the cool camera tricks fascinated me but as the film moves on i didnt see the same excersise of the camera a pityx,black_comedy
has its moments if you have ever seen the television series spaced there are several parodies between the series and this film of course as the title suggests it parodies the old zombie horror films its worth a trip to the cinema to see it for the sake of seeing it and it has a dozen laughs or so however i feel that the film loses the appeal toward the last 40 minutes of the film this is when it turns more horror and less comedy it seems as though they wanted to wrap it up quickly all at once i recommend it for the socialsociety jokes and parody humor that made the series spaced brilliant if you are in need of a laugh i would recommend this film for its light humor i rate it 510,black_comedy
first off im english so the comedy plot etc should be right up my alley i bought this on dvd after everyone said its hilarious and brilliant then saw a 30 second preview and it looked okay what a waste of 14the story goes that shaun is a bum in a crap relationship and has a fat friend and a step father whom he hates suddenly zombies no reason for them being there they just arrive it makes as little sense as the big twist at the end of scream the rest of the plot is so formulaic and predictable  his mother is obviously going to become a zombie that annoying prick boyfriend guy is gonna die but you wont care hell get the girl back the fat guy will try to be funny by being fat and a comic relief character they decide to round themselves up and barricade up in the pubthe only part of the movie that raised a chuckle is when shaun tries to vault over a garden fence which collapses but save your money you can see this in the 30 second previeweach character is as 1 dimensional as a mr man fat guy is just a typical fat guy shaun tries to take control but hes a doormat what a terrible carwreck of a film,black_comedy
i really didnt care much for the way this movie presented its main characters and their relationships to each other we have the clichs  lazy friend clumsy man jealous male rival girl wanting to break up but is undecided  the norwegian movie united from 2003 used many of the same clichs but where the romance in that movie was wrapped in video games and soccer team supporters in this movie its wrapped in video games and zombiesits the same heterosexist maleperspective tripe weve seen a million times before its well done with a talented cast direction photography and lighting but its nothing newthe zombie sequences are well done in a classic style that shouldnt disappoint those looking for homages and clichs if you like stuff like garth ennis hitman youll probably love this movie personally i thought it was ok but id rather rewatch my boyfriends back,black_comedy
minor spoilers withini waded though several positive reviews and decided to catch this one at the local retro read discount movieplex apart from a couple of amusing though unoriginal moments the movie was completely forgettable the main character starts the movie as a loser his girl sees it and ditches him the movie ends and hes still a loser but hes managed to drag his former girl down with him nice ending guys the weak social message thrown in at the end seems to be a last minute addition and has no hope of redeeming it save your time and your moneyif youre expecting something like evil dead you should look elsewhere this is not it,black_comedy
this movie was ok but not even close to as good as army of darknessplz keep in mind im not saying this movie was bad ash is much funnier than shaun aod has better action the actors around bruce campbell were better i also didnt like the was shaun who was a geek that people treated badly then all of a sudden hes the leader i did think the fat roommate was quite funny and the acting overall was pretty good ive seen a lot of worse movies but have also seen a lot better ones including army of darknessthe great idea of running to the bar was kinda dopey too especially a bar with a loaded gun hanging up where anyone and everyone can get at it,black_comedy
at release time in 2004 it was awesome comedy zombie movie but now i feel so irritating with many of character,black_comedy
i loved the film so much it is now part of my bluray collection the movie is one of the best zombie apocalypse movies ive ever seen on top of that its a parody movie its funny and filled with a serious amount of disaster and mayhem i personally love all of the characters in this film its just like the movie zombieland to me but less serious having the main characters as two stoners just adds to the greatness of this film they have this i dont give half of a sit attitude and theyre just naturally funny in this zombie situation i love how the zombies move so slow that just adds to the comedic value of the film to they have enough time to go inside and grab a collection of vinyl records come back outside and target practice on the zombies heads before they move 10 feet i laughed so hard the quirky moments in this movie will brighten up anyones bad day throughout this whole fun filled film shaun just keeps getting crapped on to his job sucks his girlfriend liz leaves him his best friend lives with him and hes a moron so on and so forth its all part of the comedy just his stupid reaction to things him and his buddy also have an obsession with this pub called the winchester this films dialog is very well done it will have you laughing and glad you watched the film in no time flat i think this film is one parody that can be enjoyed by anyone i would definitely recommend this film to others if theyre in the mood to laugh,black_comedy
is a coming of age movie set inside of a zombie apocalypse with a heavy comedic undertone the film does not exactly following the guidelines for a traditional horror or comedy film and that is in no small part what makes the film worthwhile the mashing of genres while still staying the path of a theme in which the main character is learning about himself and getting some direction in his life makes this film appealing for many different audiencessimon pegg stars as shaun a man who has grown into adulthood with no direction and not much going for him he has a job at a small store where he commands almost no respect he lives with two friends ed played by nick frost and pete ed has even less direction than shaun and spends the majority of his time playing video games or drinking with shaun at their favorite pub the winchester pete sees both shaun and ed for the men that they are and calls shaun out for it early in the movieshauns troubles do not end with his work or roommates shaun has a less than ideal relationship with his mother mainly because of his stepfather with whom he has a very strained relationship shaun is also on the verge of losing his girlfriend liz who is played by kate ashfield after a last straw liz calls quits to their relationship and shaun ends up drinking with ed at the winchester the next morning shaun and ed wake up to a zombie outbreak which is taking over their town shaun and ed devise a plan to rescue shauns mother now exgirlfriend liz and make their way to the winchester to wait out the catastrophethe explanation of how they plan to save the day is done through a montage of scenes that show the group under ideal circumstances rescued and enjoying beer while waiting for a solution the comedy used in the montage is similar to that of another zombiecomedy movie zombieland these montages add to the comedic element of the film showing perceived comical events from a third person point of view outside of the characters ownshauns first chance to begin to change his ways and show he is growing up happens as soon as he rescues his mother and step father phillip liz and her roommates phillip has been bitten by one of the zombies and is going to die shaun is able to reconcile with phillip before his passing and ultimate reanimation as a zombie he is seen shedding tears for phillip and has to break the news to his mother showing he is ready to start taking some responsibilitylater after making some more laughable yet poor choices the group finally makes it to the winchester where they decide to hold out once there the daylight fades to night and the lighting used to convey the scene is noticeably darker than the remainder of the film this is likely used to help the audience anticipate the coming tragedies of the film since the movie is a comedy as well and is not meant to shock the viewer like a true horror film shortly after dark and due to more hilarity on the part of ed lizs roommates are lost to the zombie hoard and ed is also bitten the remaining three find their way to the basement ready to call it quits and contemplating suicide when an escape through a freight elevator is discovered since ed is already infected and going to die he decides to stay behind this is also another turning point for shaun who has had ed has his safety net and companion while making nothing of themselves shaun has to say goodbye to his friend and take control to try to save himself and liz once in the street the two are rescued by the military the scene reopens a few months later and it is learned that the zombie outbreak has not only been controlled but the zombie are being used as labor for the survivors shaun and liz have moved in together and shaun seems to have found his feet and trying to make something of himself in the last scene shaun is walking out to the shed where it is discovered that zombie ed is still around kept there by shaun where they play video games and still enjoy each others companyoverall this film is very enjoyable strictly for entertainment value but still follows a coming of age theme for a viewer who may be looking for a deeper meaning or value within the film the comedy makes it lighthearted and easy to follow and plays very well in todays zombie obsessed industry this is a must watch for anyone looking for a fun movie that does not require a lot of emotional investment or thought,black_comedy
i thought that wouldnt be my style i seriously thought i would hate it but noi loved it some parts do drag especially the beginning which took a little too long to get going but i loved the films deadpan and offbeat style and effortless mix of undergraduate humour and hardcore horror if you love blood and gore you have found your match with and if you love offbeat and sophisticated humour delivered in a deadpan way you have also met your match the cinematography is innovative and unique the music just adds to the atmosphere the screenplay is extraordinarily clever and hilarious and the story is original and well constructed another strong asset is the cast simon pegg is just wonderful and nick frost is hilarious then we have great actors like penelope wilton and bill nighy who are terrific as barbara and phillip overall just a great film although it is a onejoke concept it actually works 910 bethany cox,black_comedy
i cannot quite understand how this has gotten a high rating i found it very dull  uninterestingnot the slightest bit funnyi rented this on the basis of the write up on the latest simon pegg filmrun fatboy run which stated that shaun was funnier it seems we saw different filmsnow to be fair i will admit not being a fan of zombie filmsi did not even see 28 days or the sequel i also do not care that much for comic horror moviesi like psychological horror movies where all the frightening scenes are in your mindin the acting was fair  the production was ok if this was supposed to be a comedy i wasnt laughing it did not come over as a horror movie either i was dozing off every few minutes it was so boringratings  out of 10 52 points out of 100 imdb 4 out of 10,black_comedy
zombies are boring theyre not scary theyre not intimidating they move slower than a snail and all they can do is eat you i suppose in the early days there was more of a thrill to them but that was lost as the years progressed george a romero captured the fear in his original night of the living dead and used the zombies as satire of american commercialism in his overrated sequel dawn of the dead but by the time his third film came around  the forgettable day of the dead  the zombie genre had been ruined by the outpour of romero ripoffs all of which lacked the brains of his first two moviesunderstands how lame zombies are no one responds to the monsters people carry on as if its just a bad day or something and tomorrow everything will be back to normal when shaun simon pegg runs through a crowd of the undead and swings a cricket bat at them totally unfazed by their presence its one of the films cleverer scenes because director edgar wright and writer pegg know zombies and zombie movies suckis the best modern zombie movie ever its the funniest most entertaining most emotionally captivating and surprisingly one of the darkest too lots of blood was used herepegg plays shaun a downonhisluck brit who lives with his friend ed nick frost and is about to be dumped by his girlfriend liz kate ashfield when the zombies begin to attack shaun immediately uses their presence as a way to scheme his way back into his girlfriends heart its the perfect excuse for him to go over to her apartmenttheres more heart and understanding of the human condition in this movie than most dramas it carefully balances the physical pain with the heartache  shauns cruel stepdad the always reliable bill nighy gets bitten by a zombie and as he bleeds to death he apologizes to shaun for his behavior over the years and explains that all he ever wanted was to be accepted as a father figure its a touching scene at a totally unexpected place in the movie and makes the zombie attacks more than just random acts of comedy punctuated by bloodletting  it makes them humanthis is a romantic comedy about forgiveness broken relationships estranged parents accepting your best friends flaws recognizing your own andzombies what a concept,black_comedy
as a rule i like the zombie genre regardless of how classy or trashy the finished product is according to popular opinion i found this one a bit hohum unfortunately yes a different angle to the usual but it must it always rain in zombie movies the ending at least was nonstandard and actually funnyi liked barbara i found the other characters annoying i suppose they were meant to be annoying to various degrees but i found myself wishing theyd all succumb to zombieness and get it over withi liked the fart joke i liked the quick sequences outlining what they intended to do kill philip rescue barbara etc i liked a couple of other bits but most of it was painful for me now on my list of films to avoid,black_comedy
i havent seen a movie fail to live up to the hype this much since the blair witch project remember how it was supposed to be the scariest movie of all time then do you remember sitting in the theater cheering for the witch to kill off the three crybabies who kept fussing over a stupid mapwell if you go into expecting one of the funniest movies of the year and a masterpiece in the spoof genre then youre going to be very disappointed as you stare at the screen and wonder when the humor will start please dont believe any of the reviewers claiming its a laughaminute the only way that would be possible is if youre referring to the trailer it took almost 30 minutes before the first laugh ever camethats not an exaggeration about the first 30 minutes of the story are spent showing us how much of a slacker shaun is and how irresponsible he is in his relationship with liz i guess this is all supposed to make us like him more when he decides to save liz and everybody around him from the zombies doesnt work i was just sitting there bored out of my mind waiting for something anything to happenthe best i can possibly say about this movie is its merely ok i think a viewers enjoyment will be largely based on his perception going into the movie after watching the trailer i was expecting an allout comedyparody and there are a few funny moments for example shaun and his friend act somewhat nonchalantly towards the zombies at first as they use cricket bats and old lps to do battle but most of the humor can be found in the trailerthe main problem with is it has major identity conflict it doesnt know what it wants to be it spoofs the zombie genre for a bit but then we have to sit through emotional moments that put a damper on everything i thought this was supposed to be a comedy so why do i have to sit through a scene with shaun crying while trying to make decisions about what to do to certain people who have turned into zombiesand then you have some pretty graphic moments that make it seem like the movie wants to have a legitimate horror movie feel this doesnt work because the movie isnt the least bit scary the result is the movie doesnt know exactly what it wants to be for that reason i think the mainstream american audience wont connect with itthe people this will connect with the most are the coffeehouse artsy types wholl love discussing the social commentary but for me the social commentary is about as effective as shaving with a rubber band exactly way too much time is dedicated to trying to show us that we all live zombielike lives we sit glazeeyed in front of the tv playing video games we all follow our own little cliques we head to work in the same routine every day yeah thats great you couldve expressed that point in a single sentencethere are a handful of funny and clever moments particularly the end but i wouldve liked to have seen more shock value moments played for laughs unfortunately looks to be throwing ideas against the wall to see what sticks plus the film makers are apparently in love with repetition i hear the wedding is in april for example the camera pans up from someones feet as he stumbles about we see the figure yawning and making a weird sound oh its shaun look hes acting like a zombie how cute apparently a critic somewhere mustve laughed insanely during a press screening so they decided itd be great to repeat this gag once was enoughand please dont tell me i just dont understand british humor folks i get the joke it just aint that funny if this is the best the british have to offer these days in regard to comedy then ive never been prouder to be an american the gisti have no desire to see this again and i certainly wont recommend it if youre looking for some good british comedy then i highly recommend checking out john cleeses fawlty towers but if youre in the mood to chuckle once or twice during a movie and then fight the temptation to fall asleep then will fill that bill let me put it as bluntly as i possibly can dont believe the hype,black_comedy
good movie but not as good as hot fuzzbut its still pretty good,black_comedy
the best dark comedies are the ones that are equally dark and humorous its a fine balance to walk even more challenging is a movie that goes the extra step trying to gracefully transition back and forth between those two extremes you can never tell whether or not let alone when to take them seriously or notthere are parts in that were really horrifying disturbing even there are parts that contain very serious drama and emotional moments with enough impact that they are hard to forget and leave me with knots in my stomach in a way that few actual horror flicks manage to pull off then there are moments of wry humor so expertly executed and so delightfully irreverent that this is easily one of the most quotable and ridiculous movies of the last few years campy doesnt even begin to describe its high pointsthese things are not mutually exclusive somehow shaun manages to capture very different moods mastering them and navigating between them andor blending them at will its an odd and lovely experience that will leave an impression or possibly several,black_comedy
this is my first time watching the cornetto trilogy and i was blown away by this film the jokes in this film are so funny i burst out laughingoverall this is a great comedy for everyone to watch,black_comedy
a lot of fun and unique with a lot of good editing and cinematography obviously a lot of effort went into this film the acting was very good and really brought the film to life just wouldnt be the same with simon pegg or nick frost however frosts character ed can be extremely unlikable despite adding humour it can be hard to understand why shaun lets him ruin his life but adds to peggs character once he stands up to him the makeup and effects are very timeless and will probably never age when a certain character dies it is extremely gruesome and silly all at once stands out from many other typical zombie films,black_comedy
is one of the most perfect comedies ever all the jokes are hilarious the characters are likable all the decisions the characters make are sensible it has surprisingly affective drama and it also works as a zombie movie i have no doubt that this will become a comedy classic in no time all the actors are great its great to see visual comedy in a time like now where so little comedies use camera placement lighting and music for endless jokes that you can only pick up on your second or third watch also just as i said this movie is incredibly rewatchable its not like your standard comedy where once you get all the verbal jokes there isnt anything to laugh about on your second watch ive seen this movie three times and all three times i found something new i never noticed the first time i saw it i recommend this movie to mostly anyone and i give this a 910,black_comedy
i dont know why this movie is so highly rated in my opinion this is a very ordinary movie nothing special i didnt even find it funny,black_comedy
mannys movie musings simon pegg and nick frost star in a british comedyhorror about two best friends who are caught in the middle of a zombie apocalypse in their hometown first order of business find a way to rescue peggs mom and exgirlfriend then head to a secure place the winchester pub but as everyone knows theres what you plan for and theres what really happens fans of british comedies and zombie flicks will love this great collaboration of the two genres giving its core audience lots of funny jokes zombie action and gore silliness and a few well acted scenes of drama my most memorable movie moment of is the scene when peggs group runs into another group of survivors led by peggs friend and both groups are nearly identicalmannysmemorablemoviemoments,black_comedy
the main plot is that enders get embroiled in apocalyptic london the soap opera points are played for laughs as is most of the filmthe soap opera itself is too underplayed to make a suitable impact and therefore the pathos is mainly of comedic nature which unfortunately does not engender sympathy for mostly unlikeable characters except simon peggs yes even ed hasnt enough depth to bring him alive and therefore his end is rather benign heroics notwithstanding the one poignant scene is the stepfather telling the stepson how much he is lovedas for the zombie portion of the film there are a few gruesome scenes which will keep any hardcore fan nodding lethargically but there are some real issues with continuity andor the arrow of time for example in the bar the windows are smashed out and the zombies are comin in but a few minutes later the windows are not smashed out and the zombies are back out again a serious error when the rifle is utilized it is shot from longer range rather than point blank but if simon is brave enough to use a sticky wicket or other handy instrument a running gag why not get closer with the firearm curiousthe star of the film is simon pegg and he is worth the price of admission cool under fire from some bad scriptwriting and various staging problems he rises above to create a character worth watching his comic timing has never been better and in effect he drags up the other actors who otherwise would borethe other star is the swift editing which is a nod to sam raimi as is the line join us speaking of lines night of the living dead gets at least one obvious smilebringing referenceas a whole the film is slightly ordinary having a somewhattense waiting period at the start with media clues in the background of daily life building to the inevitable a hackneyed caughtinthestructure sequence and a catchall ending before the surprise oneoff punchline for sheer chutzpah return of the living dead did it better and evil dead 2 is the king of absurdity while still maintaining complexity and chills has a place in the canon but not as high as dawn of the dead or zombieland because this is after all cheech and chong meets the living dead,black_comedy
is a romantic zombie comedy and one of the first films of edgar wright this british film shot in 2004 actors who are starring in this film are simon pegg and nick frost wellknown by films like hot fuzz and paul release date is 9 april 2004 the protagonist shaun riley is a 29yearsold manager at an electronics store his employees dont respect he cant make relationship with the girl and her friends condemn his lifestyle he standing in line at the bus stop at the supermarket on the way home from work like usual man strongly resembles zombie shaun is an ordinary man but while shaun was thinking about his gap with the girl there was a real apocalypse in the world the first extraordinary thing he saw was a woman standing with a stick protruding from her belly comedy mixes very closely with a horror the film features the directors good work and very convincing cast although there are few feeble jokes this film will have you on the edge of your seat throughout the production this is phenomenally funny scary film you would have ever seen i think that this film is fabulous in all respects if you want to watch a good comedy see a wonderful cast and have a great mood for a long time this film is your choice,black_comedy
shaun loves his deadend existence of wasting his days at the winchester a local pub with his friend and flat mate ed nick frost the films money shot arrives about 20 minutes in when shaun hungover from a hard nights drinking goes to the store and because hes so hungover and is worried about his exgirlfriend liz kate ashfield he doesnt even notice that the street behind him is teeming with the living deadwhile in the store buying a beverage he doesnt notice the bloody handprints on the refrigerator door and he almost slips in a puddle of blood i was quite amazed at the response this film got from people in the theater it seemed that every time something funny happened the response was almost always with riotous laughterstraight from britain we have what is certainly one of the most original horror movies to come out in a long time even in a genre that embraces gore is fairly light on it at least for the first 45 minutes and is dominated by laughs galoreyou may remember the character of ash bruce campbell of evil dead fame who has remained pretty much the supreme demon slayer in the horror genre but you know campbells pushed past 40 and people today may not be weary of his history slaying evil deadites in sam raimis notorious film series so maybe with the torch has been passed to simon pegg who slays more than his fair share of the living dead in this filmits pretty obvious that sotd was greatly influenced by the works of george a romero the director of 1978s supreme epic of zombie action mayhem dawn of the dead and 2002s 28 days later directed by danny boyle there are little ittybitty references to the two zombie flicks throughout the movie,black_comedy
comedies have various subforms or subbranches as in rom com spoof comedies sci fi comedies etc after watching this movie i got in touch with a new branch of comedy called as the zom com or zombie comedy it is horror in the garb of comedy consisting of real horrific zombies but the whole situation is handled with a comic touch the protagonist of the movie shaun is a loser who lives with his good for nothing friend ed and prick pete who is a practical guy his relationship with his girlfriend liz is on the docks and on the verge of breaking he hates his stepdad and his juniors at work dont respect him one fine day he decides to make things right in his life sadly the day he chooses is the same day when the zombies decide to attack planet earth now his focus is to save his near and dear ones from becoming zombies and in the process mend his life is he successful in his conquest and if yes at what price constitutes the moviestory is fine the comedy is provided through witty dialogues and some great acting the beheading and mutilation of the zombies looks amusing as well as comic initially but after sometime  it becomes a little boring the movie moves towards a predictable end and the viewer ends up thinking damn there was something missing the movie is rated very highly in many online movie portals but if you ask my opinion the movie was pretty average overall a strictly one time watchrating  710,black_comedy
i watched hot fuzz before this movie watching hot fuzz made me want to see this movie really bad i loved hot fuzzs original style of humor british comedy  and its great acting along with intricate plot the camera work from wright was different from any american films ive ever seen and made the film much more comedic and hilarious and not stuck in one situation hot fuzz was one of my favorite movies of 2007 but when i watched i was not laughing and the plot did not get me involved in the movie either the jokes were lackluster compared to hot fuzz much of the comedy doesnt fit in the acting is what got me through the movie the expressions on the main character shauns face actually had me laughing more than the jokes themselves watch this movie for the acting not the jokes and plotacting there really is not a plot but if you dont like this movie watch hot fuzz youll definitely be laughing at that,black_comedy
this basically follows the guidelines for other zombie films once bitten you turn into a zombie but this one is for laughs the zombies move slow and have weird looks on their faces and moan in a silly way our heroes shaun and ed dont seem to notice the chaos going around until they get up one morning in one funny scene shaun goes to the store to get his usual drink and doesnt notice blood on the door or people dead in allies the two spot a zombie in the yard and turn on the tv and find out whats going on they try to bash the zombies head in a series of funny events they contrive a plan to pick up shauns mom girlfriend and head over the local pub so we get more silly zombie encounters when the stepdad turns they just leave him in the car instead of kicking him out and taking the car but it doesnt matter because the zombies are too slow they make it to the pub and there is a fast conclusion just when you think they have no where left to runfinal verdict comical horror spoof much better than the scary movie spoofs i recommend this for anyone who cant miss a zombie film,black_comedy
you can tell that the writers of were paying homage to george romero in his living dead series especially dawn of the deadthough bloody the humor throughout was topnotch so much that the blood wasnt bothersome at all of course it helps if one has an idea how british humour worksi bought the dvd and can safely say its a keeper and a movie i will be watching again and againof course i wish i didnt read all the mistakes that were found in the movie who cares as long as it doesnt affect the plot rent or buy and enjoy,black_comedy
honestly this is one of the funniest movies ive ever seen and whoever thinks otherwise should be clubbed with a cricket bat in this romancehorrorcomedy shaun played by simon pegg the loser is in his own little world until he realizes that the undead are beginning to attack the living its bloody and gory at times but mostly funny this work of masterpiece is full of great quotes i guess everyone has their own opinion but i seriously dont understand the people who dont like this moviei dont see how you cant like it i must have laughed a thousand times during this film i think i speak for almost everyone when i say this is a hysterically funny movie that you can watch over and over again,black_comedy
if you appreciate tongueincheek humor in horror films british movies and well drawn characters youll like this moviethis film is really a love story between shaun simon pegg and liz kate ashfield shaun is going nowhere fast as a temporary manager in an electronics store liz is his long time girlfriend who has just dumped him because his idea of a date is to spend time at the winchester pub shaun has two roommates his mum is remarried and shaun dislikes his stepdad shaun also has an ex shaun is a zero and his life is going nowhere when the zombies appear shaun gets his chance to leadsimon pegg does a good job as shaun he is unknown to us audiences having worked mostly in british tv series but it is nick frost who steals the movie as ed the lovable slobby somewhat dimwitted roommate kate ashfield is also good as liz look for bill nighy as the stepdad burned out rock star billy mack in love actually some of the ways in which the zombies are defended against are funny including a cricket bat and eds record collection as a horror movie its fairly tame not at all like the evil dead or day of the dead there are a few gory scenes but they arent excessive in fact if those scenes were cut this could probably play on british tv the special effects are simple understated but just right credit paul dunn who has worked on black hawk down and gladiator,black_comedy
let me begin by saying that i am a huge fan of horrorcomedies i mean what are two of the strongest humor emotions fear and happiness horrorcomedies mix these two elements and if done correctly  which is no easy feat  you can have one darn fine movie and is just that ive been looking forward to this movie since i first saw it advertised in us theaters and i can sincerely say that it lived up to the highest of my expectationssimon pegg who has gained some popularity overseas for performing in the british tv show spaced stars as shaun a 30yearold brit who is stock with a crappy job and a crappy stepfather bill nighy among other things then theres his slacker best friend ed nick frost when his girlfriend liz kate ashfield dumbs shaun it looks like his life has taken the final step towards hellbut shaun is given a chance to win back liz as well as fix things up with his mother nicola cunningham and stepfather how simple he just has to defend them all against a neighborhood full of zombiesive always been a fan of movies like evil dead ii reanimator and george romeros original dead trilogy as a fan i can say that anyone else who liked those movies will love the script by edgar wright and star pegg knows when to bring in some comedy and when to let loose the horror when it does bring in horror the casual moviegoers stomach will no doubt flip  ever seen a man get ripped to pieces right in front of you while hes still living and his guts eaten the cast is terrific pegg especially you care about the characters and the only one who i didnt care about was  uh  dealt with edgar wright manages to make the film look like a comedy when theres something funny going on but when theres any horror especially towards the end of the film his direction becomes quite darkwhat can i say this is one of the best films of the year and easily the best horrorcomedy in years i was entertained throughout the entire film hilarious and absorbing shaun is anything but dead,black_comedy
shaun simon pegg is a slacker manager of a small london electrical store whose domestic life of old sofas drink and video games leads him to lose his blonde girlfriend liz kate ashfield can an unexplained plague of zombies be the catalyst for winning her backa rare british comedy that was a hit both sides of the atlantic  although it is one of those movies that you feel like you have watched after the 3 min trailer there are some movies that have the word cult written all over them from the opening scenes  this is one such case indeed this is a wonderful example of what you can do with a low budget and some good comedy performances movie references and a couple of setsthe concept is simple slackers have the chance to redeem themselves through outrageous circumstances and people that wethey dont like get the rough end of poetic justice hardly original but very much tried and testedstrangely for a comedy this doesnt have a ton of laughs in it more guffaws really and often relies on uses of bizarre devices to get out of difficult situations cricket bat shot gun prince records etclike many comedies you actually like there isnt a lot to it set up problem problem solved or not solved take the zombie element out and you could run this as a romcom about relationships this is no surprise as the writers have been brought up on itthe injokes fly and while most are featured in the trivia column there are one or two that i spotted that are not present the monkey impression gag comes from peggs sketch show past we know where you live where if silence reigned he would get up on the table and impersonate a monkey you had to see it to understandthe greatest victory for is that it injects some pace and drive in to the thingthey have learnt from guy richie about doing flashpansfantasy that you think is real doubletreble takes plan one plan two realitythe best thing about it is that it knows how long it can stay on the screen and how long you can string it out let us cheer a movie that has plenty of black comedy moments and knows when to sit down and let the credits play,black_comedy
shawn of the dead i im the person that gets scared and faints at the sight of gore going into shawn of the dead i had really thought i would be in for a really gory bloody movie well it was the complete oppositethe image of zombies has become a stereotype as defined as any person that comes back from the dead and eats people the zombies in this movie are really what a zombie is someone that comes back from the dead the later is what i did not expect start of spoiler also there is no gory well except in one scene where the guy is an idiot and smashes a huge window allowing 1000 of zombies to get in and they rip his chest open and grey and red organs and slug comes out but you can vague see itthere are also very funny parts like when shawn and ed are faced with 2 two very clammy looking zombies and start throwing records at them and going threw his collection the batman sound track toss it purple rain are you crazyalso another scene where there at a pub and the juke boxs stars playing a queen song and the boss as a zombie tries to attack shawn and they start whacking him in unison to the rhythm of the song and then he tells his friends boyfriend to kill the queen and hes like what and he says the freaking juke boxsend of spoilerover all very funny even if you are scared of gory movie have no fear this movie is good for youif you like comedy zombies beer bullets shovels romance or any combo of the choicesyou will enjoy this movie,black_comedy
it may well be a onejoke movie but this hysterical spoof of dawn of the dead manages to stretch that joke a very long way relocating the story to north london it presents a lovelorn shop assistant simon pegg and his slovenly flatmate nick frost with the task of battling an invasion of cannibal zombiesattempting to blend horror with comedy is no simple task but director edgar wright keeps both the gore and the laughs flowing freely if the film revels in its sheer goofiness  such as the moment two protagonists attempt to stop a shambling zombie by throwing vinyl records at it  it also has moments that verge on the sublime such as one characters description of the living dead as vacant with a hint of sadness like a drunk whos lost a bet this film is not a grossout spoof such as scary movie but it will have you laughing screaming and will keep you on the edge of your seat,black_comedy
one of the best movies ive seen in a while with its fair share of gore and violence as most zombie movies do the whole movie was enjoyable with the british comedy throughout the whole film my favorite character perhaps was ed nick frost whose part is just pull of hilarious things to saythe plot like a lot of zombie movies the dead just end up walking the earth with no clear explanation shaun and ed realize this go to save his exgirlfriendliz shauns mom his stepdadphil and lizs friends together they venture to seek shelter in a bar and the zombies end up breaking in and killing everybody along the way except for liz and shaun well ed is actually turned into a zombie and is later kept in shauns shed the national guard later kills off most of the zombies and liz and shaun live happily ever after and if youve seen the dvd extras lizs friend doesnt actually die only her boyfriend good horror great comedy a must for fans of the genres for both final rating 9 out of 10,black_comedy
i rarely catch standard nonscifispace opera movies at the theater preferring to catch them on video some time later and i just watched last weekend id heard good things about it and was looking forward to seeing iti was not disappointed some of the humor may be a bit britishcentric but overall the movie translated very well to the states as i think there are a lot more shauns and eds over here than our tv shows or movies might lead one to believethe fact that combines so many elements comedy horror drama may confuse some americans who have grown too used to one dimensional plots and characters in our movies thank you hollywierd but overall i think plenty of americans get this movie quite welland for my money it was one of the better movies id seen in a very long time id just seen revenge of the sith the day before during which i checked my watch several times and almost nodded off yet i scarcely budged during and immediately watched the movie again looking for more details the second time around one of the reasons i like video better than theater and found that i enjoyed better on second viewingoverall id consider an excellent comedy liberally sprinkled throughout with romance horror and dramatic elements in a very workable and watchable fusion of fun pints peanuts winchesters mothers and the odd zombie,black_comedy
this movie is a disgusting disturbing horrifying movielovely it is amazing how one person can be determined when he pretty much has nothing to lose and yet so funny especially when they first meet the 2 zombies throwing discs thing and then the bats beating the zombies in a 121212 motion and then icecreamyum an excellent form of romance and comedy and phone calls happening at the wrong timeyou know which bit i mean if youve seen the movie overall this is a lovely movie and everyone should watch it i got lucky getting into the cinemaim underage watching the movieonly 13 now funny forms of horror best movie ever,black_comedy
well lots of reviewers have told you what its all about but is it any good the short answer is yes the long answer is yes indeed good script well delivered and directed with good cinematography and if the extras footage on the dvd are any guide well edited too they dont add anything to the film good performances all around gets your attention from the first scene and holds it  i guess this comes from the writerlead actors background in sketch comedyive got a feeling that this is one of the films youll see a second and third time and spot all sorts of things you didnt notice the first time around keep looking for details in the backgroundcomment on language im not a fan on the use of the f word and in this film there is plenty of it but in this case unlike a lot of films its appropriate and it works and didnt offend anyone in our house the hero is being attach by a shirtload of zombies after all,black_comedy
im still reeling after wasting 950 to see that godawful remake of the texas chain saw massacre which soiled not only the good name of the original moviewhich is for my money the most frightening american horror film ever madebut the reputation of mr ed gein that affront to mr geins good name was the straw that broke the camels back after sitting through the horrible likes of house of a 1000 corpses house on haunted hill house of the dead and house iv i had finally accepted the fact that horror peaked in the 1970s and that any scary movie made for a large american audience these days was going to be nothing but crapand thats what the trailers for made it look like a retarded platitudefilled mess of awful humor whats worse every review i came across granted i didnt read them too carefully made sure to mention in the first sentence or two that this was a parody of zombie films goody i thought the british version of scary movie 3 there was no way in hell that i was going to watch itbut then i was lucky enough to catch a few episodes of the british comedy spaced on trio one evening and i loved it during commercial breaks the announcer was sure to mention that the people who made spaced had also made and then theyd show the trailer for the film this confused me how could the makers of such an original funny program be responsible for what looked like a horrible film could itcould it be that tv was lying to me or was the distributor of this film somehow trying to dumb down its image to make it more palatable to the simple tastes of american middleschoolers that allimportant demographic that 999 of all hollywood films made in the last five years have been geared towards it was all too confusing i had to find solace in drink when i woke up there was a copy of on dvd lying next to me i popped it in and was blown awaythe humor is original i cannot stress that enough as i cannot remember the last time i saw anything bordering on original humor in a horror film the plot may be middle of the road but its saved by its refusal to stick to the usual zombie film contrivances in which five of ten character archetypes tough guy sissy guy sassy black woman et cetera are pitted against zombies in one of three different situationseven if the plot for were as clichd and moronic as house of wax the characters would have made it an enjoyable film they dont stick to predetermined roles aside from dylan morans david and are actually wellrounded and gasp charming the gory special effects are wondrous the pacing is great and the spacedlike cinematography transfers perfectly to the big screenmy sole complaint is with the character david played by black books dylan moran morans bernard black a surly alcoholic who owns a bookstore is one of the funniest characters ive seen imported to america in years morans talent is wasted as the 2dimensional foil to simon peggs incredibly likable shaun he does a tired job of whining his way through his lines and doesnt garner a single laugh,black_comedy
discussion of what albums can be sacrificed such as the soundtrack to batman are just one of the many hysterical segments in this filmunlike the typical pacefading tempo british films are used to dishing out to their viewers this one actually gains momentum as it knocksoff character favorites along the way this film should please fans of both mr bean  monty python pun humor and the eewww that was gross humor as well also i love how the winchester pub gives shaun and ed new goals aside their current content for life which is killing zombies and drinking beerbritish horror fans and horror fans around the world can thank mr romero for capitalizing on the lowbudget horror industry which spawns this creative and insightful comedy unlike the evil dead films this horror comedy actually puts zombies and gore on a backburner and brings forth some wicked humor and splendid performancesall in all its a very funny great time,black_comedy
is the first movie in ages to actually have me rolling around on the carpet trying desperately not to pee myself laughing for fear of having to run off to get showered and changed and miss any of itand thats with the dvd at home the combination of dry brit humour very relatableto drama and well the living dead is contagiously hysterical and to add to this is a movie that is instantly gettable but also grows on you with each viewing i especially love the humour relating music and violencehmmm reminds me of a very outthere seventies director actually i am finding that some younger people i try to pass the good word onto concerning what i consider to be a new comedic gem just seem to miss the point regardless i will never look at the faithful cricket bat in the same way againcheers,black_comedy
as forceful in its emotion as it is in its comic bits this movie tells its story with a genuineness that is unexpected the seriousness enhances the comedy and vice versa making it fulfilling intellectually if one accepts the zombies as just being there as well as comicallyeasy to appreciate for someone not generally interested in horror movies it is just gory enough to satisfy those that are characters to care about in plentiful supply even those briefly met shot in an interesting style that gives an oddly horrific focus to everyday activitiesthe ease with which the film maker introduces the viewer to life in suburban england adds poignancy to the strange goings on that are the major draw of the film the apathy of the lead character is transformed into action sincerely the acting is spotless and professional at times exceptional,black_comedy
the only reason i rented this movie was that there was a half price deal on the second movie at my local video ezy and my boyfriend is a fanatical black books fan and i felt he deserved something for agreeing to watch bridget jones two with me bridget jones ha not that its not a watchable moviewith a great fight scene but ha ive never seen a zombie flick and i didnt watch this as a zombie flick and everyone who complains about it in terms of it being a zombie flick needs to understand that simon pegg is a comedian but people also need to understand its not a spoof this is spaced humour this is black books humour this is that type of british comedy humour and its bloody hilarious my only complaint is davids death and not just because i like my boyfriend am a black books fanatic but also because up until then the movie hadnt been particularly gruesome so disemboweling however fake it looked upon repeat viewings was a bit of a shock and i have to admit the end was an anticlimax both dramatically and comedically but im willing to overlook this on account of its humour originality and the fun we had going hey thats the girl from episode whatzit of black books or i know ed was the security security security guy oh and i read somewhere someone complaining about how the movie broke away from zombie fact zombie fact ,black_comedy
this movie was greatto say the least it poked fun at its self and kept true to the horror element even george romero liked it thats pretty good coming from the guy who had to sit through all the crapreturn otld children otld among others that the company didnt copy write on funny as hell not the best zombie movie but still good for those who like a good comedy and horror flicks if you should disagree with what i say email me at jamnlokihot mailcom and tell me what you think is wrong with this if you think something is messed upyou dont know sht about horror flicks let me know if you got a problempersonally,black_comedy
this was an incredible movie loved every second of it i felt that their accents just helped the movies comedy characters were all hysterical and lovable i have a diverse group of friends and they all loved it too also when i say the characters were funny i meant every single person in the movie including the extras overall beginning to end it was one of my favorite movies ever even though there is a romance plot i still loved it it was actually funny and just introduced us to more funny characters shawn is the man he is so random and funny and even loved his british accenthope this helps you in making your choice in watching this movie,black_comedy
this is probably one of my favorite films i am not british but i love british humor i instantly fell in love with all of the characters dianne and ed being my favorite 2 and the fact that shaun was so homely made him even more appealingas hard as that sounds it was a heartfelt movie as well it could have u laughing and have your eyes filling with water at the same moment i loved this moviei was very torn up when ed was dying and when they revealed him in the end to be in the shed i thought it was a very cute ending liz was a good character she was strong and wasnt the weak exgirlfriend that swoons over the male in the end and is the damsel in distress every 3 seconds this i liked this movie rocks my socks,black_comedy
what a great british mishmash of fantastic stuff havent had such a laugh in ages this film is highly recommendable nevermind if you dont like blood andor gore  the amount of seriousness in this movie is more or less on par with your standard episode of tom  jerry for once it seems a zombieflick actually had a budget theres nothing to complain about in the special effects department and the visual style of the film is just plain great if youve seen darren aronofskys requiem for a dream and guy ritchies lock stock and two smoking barrels youll probably see some common ground in the visual style  although contains nothing of the seriousness of requiemsure a few hundred liters of blood but its just plain ole fun 1010,black_comedy
poor shaun a twentysomething on the nearer end of 30 hes got a deadend job at the electronics store where he works a deadending relationship that his pretty and pretty bored girlfriend wants to deepsix a flatlining rapport with his doting mum and disapproving stepdad and various friends neighbors acquaintances and the like who are justdeadno i take that back undeadlike the best and brightest python skit taken to extremes that would even raise their eyebrows is a breath of fresh fetid air in a genre thats been dying for a bite of good solid comic irony the truly talented simon pegg who plays shaun with the right combination of distress and deadpan humor also cowrote the script with edgar wright and boy do they know their movies good thing too because as so many satirists before them have demonstrated you have to truly love whatever the issue or thing is that youre poking fun atbut this is not simply some naked gun or scary movie copycat here the quality that makes the humorhorrorheartbreak chemistry cook is the realness of the relationships that have been developed between the characters as well as all the details of their lives which the audience can readily relate to going through the daily grind of his life mired in his own sense of misery and ennui shaun barely notices the changes taking place in the world around him as the dead begin to rise and walk and we all laugh knowingly because weve all had times when we feel that way and more often than notthe social commentary a nod to george romeros brilliant worldview presented so effectively in dawn of the dead to which this film pays loving homage is what elevates shaun to a level far beyond the usual gutmunch extravagoreza and it poses some really interesting questions arent all of us in some ways a lot like shaun with aspects of our lives that are just like his and the people around us zoned out into their own little worlds the same way we all are if they died and came back to life as zombies would we actually notice if it happened to us would they notice but before things get too philosophical there is so much more to shaun that can be appreciated besides the outstanding performances from everyone with simon pegg and nick frost taking the lead as our hero and ed his neerdoanythingwell best bud this movie is damn near flawless scriptwise and technically as well there is a sequence near the films beginning done in one continuous take that de palma would envy and hitchcock would be proud of and if youve seen this movie you know exactly what im talking about what makes it so fascinating and startlingly funny is all the little background details you can spot which of course shaun is oblivious to even better is the second time around when the sequence is repeated but things are vastly different its so well done that it may take repeat viewings to pick out everything you missed the previous timewell i have never seen spaced and probably wont get the chance unless they show the reruns on bbc america but if shaun is any indication of what the cast of that show is capable of on the usual episode ill have to keep an eye on the listingsbut for lovers of horror the zombie genre or just a good black comedy with something different to offer look no further we were fortunate enough to get a dawn remake that didnt suck but if you want to do better than just a movie with minimal suckage dont rent this one buy it that way you can save the money youd be spending otherwise on repeated rentals because you will be watching this more than once trust me,black_comedy
depending on how you look at it is either a satire of the zombie concept itself or a satire of how hollywood really seems to fail to get it the film starts out in an almost quiet sedate fashion reminiscent of many a british soap opera indeed when our hero passes by some of the recently reanimated dead he passes by them with such nonchalance that one has to wonder exactly how soon we would notice if the dead started getting up and eating our neighbours no explanation is offered for why they start doing so and i doubt that one is really needed by now the zombie concept is so entrenched in imagination that it defies belief that the films people think of when one mentions zombies are not those made by the great george romerounlike the excerable resident evil apocalypse which effectively sent itself up the comedy in is subtle fully intentional and even wellorchestrated as in any good zombie film social normalities are messed with peoples expectations of how their actions will turn out are defied and more humans are killed by the stupidity of their peers rather than any direct contact with the zombies as is promised in the theatrical trailers you will get to see zombies being killed with every household or gardening implement imaginable even the old record collection gets a try by far the funniest moment in the film however is the ending which is where the implication that this film was intended to satirise the commercial film systems inability to understand the zombie concept comes from i wont spoil it for you but it will bring to mind images of the attempts to make certain sequels as familyfriendly as possibleinterestingly product placements are also minimal in this feature in the ninetyodd minutes it ran for i could not count a single instance where a product was displayed for no other reason than flashing a logo in the audiences face not that having recognisable products in a film is necessarily bad but after some films in which one can play guess which phone company paid for production the contrast is nice given the minimal budget involved they wouldnt have needed product placement in order to make a profit more on that anonunlike a lot of zombie films especially the aforementioned resident evil sequel uses the 2351 frame very effectively shots of zombies being shot in the head are staged very smoothly and some of the outdoor scenes have a dynamic framing that leone would admire indeed one would never guess that it only cost four million dollars to make from looking at it thats almost as impressive in lowbudget terms as mad max but what really keeps the film going is the story simple and to the point it gets the horror element going without resorting to the usual big conspiracy ideas that some zombie films sadly trip themselves over whoever thought that so much could be made out of a trip from the apartment to the pub by way of mothers homewhen i think about what kind of score to give an eight seems most appropriate the humour is often culturespecific and there are only a few outright bellylaugh moments but it is entertaining from start to finish unlike many of the recent entries in the genre it is attempting to satirise,black_comedy
this movie is brilliant because of the many levels of emotions it covers clever different intelligent fun moving sad hilarious and thirsty  it made me want a pint  shaun well played by simon pegg and his best friend ed played hilariously by nick frost are great together their chemistry is palpable shauns love interest a blonde  why are they always blonde does not do a good job convincing me that she is in love with shaun her two friends accurately portray their relationship and also their relationship to shaunat the same time i loved shauns mum played flawlessly by penelope wilton barbara who was so warm playing the sweet loving mother of her little boy the entire remaining cast is excellenti shouldnt forget all the extras who did such a fine job portraying the zombies they were very well done with some good old zombie munching going on 1010zafoid,black_comedy
is superb simple as that it is clearly targeted at fans of spaced and university students it will entertain both the script is razor sharp and loaded with jokes nick frost excels in particular as simon peggs costar most of the big names from the current crop of british comics make an appearance if only fleetingly in a film that is perfectly paced and a joy to watch there is nothing pretentious about this film which is refreshing to see in a world of schmaltzy hollywood blockbusters there is a good dose of comedy violence well played out and adding to the film immensely simon pegg is rapidly becoming one of britains national treasures everything he touches seems to turn to gold long may it continue,black_comedy
nice work by all in this romanticzombiecomedy acting and casting are spot on the direction and effects deftly pay homage to the genre and elevate the work of everyone involved kudos to simon pegg  co for a great script well acted a lot of fun i particularly enjoyed the musical references in the script and the slick editing heres hoping there is a shawn of the dead ii floating around out there simon i for one will be in line to check it out clever camera work and music helped to enhance the mood  if you know what i mean i would recommend this movie highly  even to casual horror fans to anyone who loathes hollywood horror or comedy movies for their lack of creativity will be pleasantly surprised here clearly this is a film made outside the umbrella of the big studio culture,black_comedy
apologies for the awful summary aboveshaun is a 29yearold electrical salesman living in london he shares a house with two friends and has a steady girlfriend liz shaun shuffles through life oblivious to events and situations surrounding him such as his failing relationship and the sudden outbreak of zombies liz is tired of shauns insistence on spending every opportunity that he can in the winchester pub shaun promises to take her to a restaurant but due to interference from his overpowering stepdad forgets to book shaun reluctantly suggests going to the winchester and is promptly dumped it would all be a pretty straightforward uncomplicated story if it were not for the continuous news coverage played out in the background shaun and his friends remain oblivious to this however detailing the recent deadreturningtolifeandeatingpeople phenomenon soon the zombies are attacking and increasing in numbers and shaun has to shake his ineptitude to lead his friends to safety rescue his mum and get liz back the film opens with the original dawn of the dead soundtrack playing over the universal logo which gradually merges into the specials ghost town this sets the tone for the film as this is as much homage to romeros living dead trilogy as it is to british culture and comedy its not an easy mix but somehow simon pegg and edgar wright strike an easy balance between them in a brilliant screenplay the first act is played mainly for laughs and as a set up for the characters who are particularly wellrounded for a genre film and to also slowly build the zombie epidemic up around them the use of radio and television to portray the arrival and eventual epidemic of the zombies is a nice touch and harks back to romeros dawn only here the news reports go unnoticed in the background as people go about their business with little regard for the events surrounding them so were surrounded by zombies anyway on the bus in the street at work  shuffling around oblivious to each other and our problems this is a point made bluntly but to good effect in shaun again harking back to romeros film where the dead represent a nation of zombielike consumers the mannerisms of the dead are similar too shaun opts for the slow shuffling zombies as opposed to the new fast ones that seem to have replaced them in modern cinema in fact this is a film that uses romero as a law a zombie law this is romeros universe only the events are happening in london instead of pittsburgh the comedy works on two levels within shaun obviously one level is for humour but the other level is an increased realism how many zombie films are there when having dispatched their first zombie by bludgeoning them with a cricket bat our hero has to sit down and have a cup of tea through the second act and into the third the tone of changes the comedy purposely thins out a little as the zombies lay siege on our heroes in fact the final act of shaun is downright terrifying touching and gory as hell including a death scene that ranks up there alongside the best not to give too much away but all thats missing is the line choke on em should appeal to a wide audience the self titled romzomcom has just that a romantic story involving shaun and his ex whom he strives to win back lots and lots of zombies and enough laugh out loud visual and verbal comedy moments than you can shake a disembodied leg at so shuffle on down to your local and see this truly unique british film,black_comedy
2004 me and a friend this movie had intrigued me since it promised to be scary and funny the only actor i had heard of was bill nighy nonetheless we turned up and saw one hell of a great movieto start on a somewhat negative note the film is very clichd the films plot seems uninspired it interweaves the average romcom plot loser tries to sort out his life with the help of his funny friend with the typical horror plot a small group of people try to survive the undead onslaught but its done in such a way that it manages to be entertaining the generic romcom characters are pulled off in such a way by the players that it doesnt feel like youve seen it a thousand times before though you havesimon pegg shines as the eponymous hero although the best performance comes from newcomer nick frost in his role as ed the ultimate useless sidekick to hero romcom stereotype he farts admits that he loves shauns mum deals drugs plays timesplitters and does buggerall as a result he gets the best linesdespite the fact that the whole movie in a certain light seems boring it has some great zombie action  the most memorable being the backyard scene it also has the best references to horror movies making light of everybody from dario argento to lucio fulci from george romero to sam raimi this has all the makings of a cult classic and i suggest you seek it out if you want something funny,black_comedy
i thought this was going to be dumb another comedy spoof of a horror movie boy was i wrong it was more serious then anything close to the end it is also fairly funny though david tended to get on my nerves belive me youll love how he dies i also loved that they used some classic tunes from the old dawn of the dead for instance the mall muzak think thats what its called and a few others sometimes i wish i had a dubber for it because sometimes the actors accents kick in real bad and the speak super fast it gets hard to follow at times other then that awesomedespite being a comedy it is rather gory when it comes to deaths mostly davids the acting was rather good too as well as the humor rent this movie if you love it buy it hell i just had it turned on ppv and bought it on dvd the next daya little slow paced at the start though but once shaun and his girlfriend break up and the zombies start thats when it gets rather good and funnylove how instead of going to the mall they head to a bar clever 1010,black_comedy
what do you get when you have an electronic salesman his moronic best mate and a city widely growing in zombie population of course released at least in the uk around the same time as the remake of dawn of the dead this was a great comic relief to anyone who thought the latter would be too scary but still wanted there walking dead fix step in simon pegg great british actor and star of many comic shows including spaced and nick frost who was also in spaced and there portrayal of lazy drunken men who entire life is turned around by the realization of the dead coming back to lifesimon pegg is shaun senior sales assistant at a local electronics store he hates his stepfather and his girlfriend is becoming very bored with him add ed frost into the picture his best friend who just happens to live with him bringing in no money and playing playstation all day long nighttime belongs to the winchester pub shauns local where he spends time with liz his girlfriend and her friends david and diannewhen liz decides that enough is enough shauns world is turned upside down but another night in the winchester with ed and a very drunken rave in their living room and he is helped to forget her maybe not for a long time but long enough to be absolutely hammered its only then that the true hilarity begins whether searching through records to decide which to throw at the oncoming undead or arguing whether dogs can look up this movie if full of humor and gore what more do you need even better is the end of the movie which i will leave for you to see all in all is the reason that every one should give british films another look,black_comedy
i saw a commercial for this movie a while ago when it had just come out in the states it looked like a good laugh but little did i know it was so much more than that is genius the jokes are so smart and funny they make a fart joke good the directing is wonderful edgar wright did a fantastic job simon pegg stares and the protagonist shaun riley who works at his job for an electronics store he lives in a flat with his friends ed and petewhen i saw this in theaters i wanted to see it again as soon as it was over it has something for everyone action comedy romance zombies its the holy grail of movies besides monty python if you like movies see it if you dont like movies see it anyway i give it a 1010 i could watch it over and over and over,black_comedy
this movie is so funny i was at a friends house and we had just watched the grudge and so we were a little on edge we didnt really like that movie but you know what i mean and so we were either going to watch or some more horror movies this was such a good choice you cannot take this movie seriously one of my favorite things about this movie is the fact that it switches genres faster than you can think but youre laughing so hard it doesnt make a difference i have not seen dawn of the dead but i got the movie anyway it did help a little that someone told me what it was about but i still cracked upi would recommend this movie to anyone just as long as you have a sense of humor and like a little laugh if youre totally in love with comedies youll be splittin your sides this movie made me laugh so hard i almost peed my pants,black_comedy
even if you are a horror movie fan you have to admit that many movies in this genre are rather lame and i happen to be one of those people those that are successful meaning they have gained cult status usually are so because of their emphasis on humour lord of the rings director peter jacksons splatterfest dead alive comes to mind than gore or jumpoutofyourseat terror an offering from the uks edgar wright is one such flick your local bmovie aficionado would likely mention it in the same sentence as their troma favorites even with its mainstream appealis essentially a love story with zombies lurking about in the background its unlikely hero shaun simon pegg is a late 20s slacker who works in an electronics department he lives a losers life and is looked down upon by his coworkers is estranged from his mother and stepfather who are disappointed in his underachievement and his favorite hobby is sitting around playing video games and smoking pot with his flatmate ed the only thing he looks forward to in life is hanging out with his friends at the winchester a local pub which is rumored to contain a cache of firearmsthings start to roll when shauns girlfriend liz decides shes had enough of his dithering and lassitude and leave him shaun wants to win her back but isnt sure how people start acting strangely staggering around with vacant looks and biting at passers by though shaun is oblivious to all this unusual behaviour to him its little different from seeing striving capitalists heading off to their desk jobs after he finally realizes what is going on though no explanation is ever given for the zombie phenomenon he takes action and decides to somehow save his girlfriend from the living dead and rescue his mother from the stepfather he despises who has also started to show signs of zombieficationas mentioned the movie has plenty of humour and wit though one might have to be british to understand a lot of it with little gore and few scary moments one particularly funny scene has shauns group making its way to the winchester pub through a throng of living dead by mimicking their mannerisms thereby not drawing any attention to themselves another involves shaun and ed using shauns records like ninja throwing stars to stop the dead in their tracks as befits what is essentially a romantic comedy the movie has a happy ending with a surprising epilogue as well several queen classics in the soundtrack make for an additional treat this movie might even be good for a first date make sure you dont die of laughter 810,black_comedy
spaced fans love it especially the scene in the winchester at the start where ed and shaun go over what happens the next day as a pub run we have a bite at the kings head phils demise into a zombie come back to the winchester for some shots the rifle shootings at the pub a bloody mary the girl in the garden the other thing is that it is not a spoof unlike the opinions of others simon and edgar respect the movies to much if you are new to the spaced fan club and have only seen shaun and enjoyed it of course than i suggest you go out and get the spaced dvds or collection as you will be surprised at the classic lines fitted into each episode and the movie parodies which are the basis for the show especially episode 5 series 1 the zombie episode in which began the idea for shaun,black_comedy

an average day for shaun turns nasty as people suddenly turn to zombies including his flatmate he sets out to rescue his family and exgirlfriend and to take them to the only place he regards as safe  his local pub the winchester unfortunately the zombie virus is contagious and kills off his group members including his mum leaving shaun and his ex to fight off zombies the film gets a little gruesome towards the end and is not for the faint hearted i had nightmares about zombies disembowelling me for days after the film should have won a bafta and you would be foolish not to see it as it is one of the greatest british comedies of all time,black_comedy
coming from sunny old england its rare to see a brits sense of humour captured so well on the big screen for many years all the english comedy market spilled out was a reel of hugh grant romcoms but now suddenly a film that has cult classic written all over it you could just imagine the meeting when simon pegg walked into the office and pitched his film idea i want to create a romantic comedy oh yeah and it contains zombies surely that meeting alone would have been funnier than any of the recent hollywood comedies released with the finest british comedians on display and a suttle comedy admits all the zombies and gore this film somehow comes out as not only hilariously funny but also brilliantly clever this film is the best thing to cross the atlantic since the office hit the americans shore a well done to simon pegg and his team and i cant wait to see what they follow up with,black_comedy

ever watch a romero flick and wonder why is it theres always some heroic and noble character in there what would happen if you stuck real life people in this situation answers that question actually it answers that question with such precision that its quite disturbing with my luck i wouldnt be stuck with expert marksman and allaround badass roger from dawn of the dead hell no with my luck id be sitting in the dark eating peanuts with shauni love the approach the creators took to the film instead of a relentless and mindless bashing of the zombie genre is actually quite affectionate towards its inspiration as far as the zombies go is every bit as legitimate as george romeros movies what makes it a comedy is the characters and how they deal with the situation in dawn and day of the dead you have military personnel trying to survive in a place they can fortify in you have a guy sitting in the dark eating peanuts as he waits for the whole thing to go awaythis approach i feel is infinitely superior to the whole lets make mindless jokes that appeal to the lowest common denominator method the humor isnt always insultingly spelled out and shoved down the audiences throatfreezeframe and flash laugh now on the screen why dont they see scary movie 3 i like how the humor in shaun stems from simple observations about zombies how they resemble drunks and when you have a hangover you really dont notice them and i really like how some jokes will only register with horror fans a restaurant named after fulci heh ill pass thanks the cast of misfits is fun to follow and possesses a degree of depth thats vital for good comedies to work granted purely silly characters can work when theyre the exception and not the rule bear in mind im not talking scorsesedeep characters but these arent purely goofball caricatures a la monty python when done well and scary movie 3 when done poorly they have their moments of glory moments of trauma and moments of despair i mean end of the world zombie infestation can become quite depressing when you think about it but through it all the film is still funny still a comedy    a black comedy but a comedy nonethelesson a separate note  i think its funny for the wrong reasons that is one of the first zombie films to show a death scene reminiscent of the master tom savinis dead effects since    well tom savinis work on dawnday of the dead choke on em anyway is a film for zombiegenre freaks made by zombiegenre freaks everyonell get something out of it but the genre fans will watch shaun with the satisfaction that this project fell into the hands of people who actually know the genre instead of someone who simply knows of the genre,black_comedy
so much fun shaun is one of those films that you need to watch a few times to catch all the subtle comedic lines original comedy with lots of filming creativity youll find yourself rooting for shaun very quicklyshaun manages to accomplish so much  comedy originality fear had me clenching quite a few times and romance all wrapped in a commentary about friendship and sticking with your friends until the very endis there a better date movie i dont think so shaun will fool the guys into thinking theyre watching a comedyhorror spoof this suddenly it springs this romance on you but its too late youre already suckered in too and i figure a few of the lilyboys might actually shed a tear of two,black_comedy
shawn of the dead is not the best zombie movie ever made nor is it the best romantic comedy however it fills both roles so amazingly well that lovers of both genres should be satisfied that is unless your movies have to scare the pants off of you people who love to be scared arent going to get kicks from this movie its more of a fastpaced suspense film with some good fake blood and gore and a feelgood drama going on in the background aside from the genre the film also employs some good story advancement techniques such as the television ads and joke shows that are reminiscent of verhoevens work total recallstarship troopers this movie does not attempt to be epic or create some otherworldly or postapocalyptic dreamscape but it creates an intimate mood between the small group of survivors who exist in an innocuous suburban enclave except with zombies furthermore it manages to pull all of its elements together without leaving anything behind or unfinished i found it incredibly fun to watch and that is as good of a measure i can think of for a film perhaps its not the only measure but we all to have a laugh now and again,black_comedy
yes we all know about how terrific original creative funny etc this movie is but there is one aspect of that tends to be overlooked one thing that  to my knowledge  no zombie movie has ever pulled off as well as shaun maybe because of the expectations an audience has of a zombie comedy as opposed to a flatout zombie movie and that is the zombie buildup think about it night of the living dead had a zombie show up to motivate the plot within the first five minutes dawn of the dead and day of the dead both started in medias zombie and even if the zombies werent actually on screen for the first fifteen or twenty minutes they were the driving force behind the plot i liked 28 days later which was in form and execution a zombie movie with slightly modified monsters but i was a little disappointed that they skipped over the 28 days of chaos after the rage virus emerged lets face it nobody deals with the daytoday mechanics of a zombie invasion until nowby using the romanticcomedy element of the movie the filmmakers were able to move the movie from the start without using zombies you have twenty minutes of relationship comedy with weird elements in the background and you get to watch as the world slowly collapses into zombified chaos now thats brilliant the characters arent zombie movie characters theyre romantic comedy characters who suddenly have to fight the undead again thats brilliant lets face it we dont live our lives like a zombie movie if there are lots of police sirens going off or people running down the street in a panic we figure theres lots of crime and people are morons thats what makes zombie movies so effective its not like these are aliens conquering the earth zombies are just like us plays zombies for laughs but at the end  as in any good zombie movie  whatever were laughing at is really truly terrifying,black_comedy
minor british pictures quite often turn out to be little gems and heres another contribution to that fine traditionsimon pegg turns in an assured performance as the hapless shaun a loser in a deadend job who knows how to hang on to useless friends like ed nauseatingly well played by nick frost but cant keep his attractive girlfriend liz kate ashfield because he cant manage a simple thing like reserving a restaurant table then he really finds himself as london is subjected to a plague of zombiesdifficult to fault any of the performances in this film and the soundtrack is well judged but the main pleasures are in the visual gags and some superb one liners my favorite among the former were the early scenes showing the deadening nature of shauns everyday life and a later scene where shauns party seeking to find refuge at a local pub encounter a party led by his exgirlfriend the groups are mirror images and greet each other as if they were at a vicarage tea partythe ending works well though some may find it tasteless it is at least consistent with the restrecommended unless youre put off by gore or strong language rating 710,black_comedy
successfully splices drama comedy and horror into one great film from start to finish keeps you entertained and gasping for morethe photography and direction of this film is superb from the opening shot at winchester to the unique cuts of shaun preparing for work they knew what they were doingwriting is by far the absolute best i have seen in a long time every joke and line is delivered well not only because of the acting skills but by the structure itselfthis is going be one film that will live on to see light another dayjvl film maker,black_comedy
of all the many horror film subjects zombies are arguably the most popular these resurrected flesheating stifflimbed groaning fiends who stalk the earth in search of living bodies to devour are constantly captivating viewing audiences and haunting the dreams of the more impressionable zombie films range from the deadly serious and scary such as dawn of the dead to classics such as night of the living dead to series films like zombie 1 2 3 and 4 some series regarding the walking dead begin seriously but quickly degenerate into ridiculous parody such was the case with the evil dead trilogy a cult classic loved for its outlandish last installation these parodies are the inspiration for other parodies the latest of these hailing from the uk directed by edgar wright and obviously playing off the similarlytitled dawn of the dead is a completely hilarious zombie parody replete with dry british humor and flesheating fests,black_comedy
while hilarious does at the same time pay respect to a horror genre loved by so many many of the horror scenes are humorously played out but many are genuinely creepy with an atmosphere to suit thats not to say this is a really scary movie just that it was not portrayed and a mockery or spoof of the genreshaun simon pegg and his girl liz kate ashfield are having a few problems in their romantic life determined to correct his wrong doings he sets out to win back her heart only to find the streets are filled with zombies and he his friends his family and his girl are in very real mortal dangerfresh original comedy simon pegg and nick frost are hilarious that has an interesting story and is well produced and written films like this dont come around very often so embrace it enjoy it and appreciate it for what it is and thats a fine movie910,black_comedy
for some reason the zombie movie is back in a big way and i am loving it this movie is just plain fun simon pegg as shaun nick frost as ed kate ashfield as liz dylan moran as david bill nighy as phillip and penelope wilton as barbara make up a great cast everyone has some good lines and there are references aplenty to other zombie movies my favorite reference is the shot of shaun and ed through the hole of mary which is extremely similar to a shot in death becomes her of madeleine and ernest through the hole of helen my three favorite scenes are shauns walk to the store on zday the saving mum and liz montages and the final showdown in the bar you have to see shaun ed and liz beating a zombie to queens dont stop me now to fully appreciate it unlike the beat the audience on the head with the joke comedies that we see too many of this movie uses shaun for the subtle and ed for the very unsubtle can i get any of you cts a drink is an fine example of eds vocabulary this is married to watching shaun blindly pass several zombies on the way to the store and even talking to one as he passes oblivious the first scene is staged well also reveling people only as they are mentioned i could go on seemingly forever with what i like about this movie people who dont like movie should not be trusted or associated with for fear of infection the dvd has some fun features including plot holes explained a complete early storyboard of the film good deleted scenes and outtakes such as sean connery and michael caine in the man who would be shaunshaun david kill the queen david what shaun the music,black_comedy
the rise of the zombies is upon us at least its occurring in this great zombie parody movie about one man shaun who is trying to protect his 2 friends his girlfriends 2 friends and his mother from becoming another part of the zombie racethis movie came out right after dawn of the dead left the theaters the remake and i give them props for the remake in the style that they made its set in england so you get the cultural change the flagrant use of a cricket bat the different style of cars a kid playing with a soccer ball the frequent going to the pub etc from the real dawn of the dead which i thought was a great addition there was a slight humor to the situations that were involved which was the main point of this movie because any obvious airplanelike gags wouldve probably been seen as overthetop also they love music in this movie queens songs are being played almost every 5th scene it seems and theres pretty good underground culture being recognized sining white lines with an accompanying zombie an aphex twin poster in the hall etc this movies very entertaining especially for parties and the like because of the frequent action and humor there are some touching points being made between shaun and his parents for example but after wards that turns around a full 360 degrees when hes got the responsibilities to kill them off because theyve been made into zombies thats a little too much given away but theres more to the movie anyways i gave it an 810 it had a few parts that got away from the action and everything the romantic element but otherwise its fantastic run out and buy it today,black_comedy
the other 97 of reviews here are on the money rented this dvd on new years day without knowing anything about it hey were expats just recognized bill nighy on the cover  thought yeah english movie went home toasted with my japanese wife  australian bud and all three of us were in tears of laughter im not sure if its pc or not but my 2 kids too young watched it straight after then we put it on again returning it to the rental store sucked so we bought a copy the next dayno spoilers no great script review everybody else wrote those imdb rules say that we cant write extra short reviews if we could mine would be dont read this just watch this movie the outtakes are pretty much priceless toosequel please,black_comedy
i was reluctant to watch because im not a horror film fan is it just me or are films that want to screw me up emotionally for life just a bad idea  but the previews looked good and delivered it was a little scary but no more so than the average action film and truly hilarious and this is from a guy who didnt even get the in jokes the film balanced the ludicrous situations necessarily for humor with some real characters necessary for us to care about them and get drawn into the drama and quite intelligent too this wasnt the mummy not by a long shotwithout spoiling the film i can tell you that critically there was no deus ex machina convenient trick ending that makes no sense the rules for zombie behavior did not vary conveniently to the plot and the parallel between zombies and reallife people living monotonous lives was a wonderful analogy i loved this film the only flaw i can think of is that it is fairly low as far as special effects and stunts go the ending is cute but could have been higher impactwho should see this film comedy lovers and its safe for most kids definitely all horror film lovers ill give an outstanding 8 out of 10,black_comedy
firstly there was hardly any way i wouldnt have liked this film i love zombie movies i love gore the only problem with this movie i had was that it could have used more gore and cannibalism but then again im a zombie shall we say connoisseur and i expect a lot of gore this movie follows ecstatically the road well paved by george romero and peter jacksons dead night of the living dawn of day of and deadalive respectively plus with commercial approval from george romero peter jackson and sam raimi hell how could you go wrong i wouldve wasted money on alien vs predator if those three had approved of it publicly although i would have to question their sanity while there wasnt enough gore for me there seemed to be plenty for the average moviegoer judging from the reaction of the audience around me but again i enjoy zombie zombi 2 in italia dawn of the dead both versions day of the dead and deadaliveand good luck topping the gore of those films and getting away with an r rating but to all you zombie fans you will as can be expected enjoy noticing several obvious and notsoobvious references to past zombie worksmostly romeros masterpieces right down to individual character lines to tiny portions of music its also a great movie for a first date with a teenyboppery ditz girl no really it is shell be all over you afterwardssuckerwwwresidenthazardcom,black_comedy
this movie was bloody well doneno pun intended i went into this film not knowing really what to expect but maybe a dark comedy which is why i came out very happy while i was right about it being funny its also an excellent zombie film going on in the meantime believe it or not there werent as many comical moments as i thought there was going to be but some instances were just downright hilarious the acting was superb and i could tell it mustve been an extreme challenge for them since theyd have to go from comedic to dramatic to tragic in what was sometimes probably only a matter of seconds i definitely gave a big thumbs up to the cast after i noticed this even with the apparent lowbudget i think the zombies were effective and looked just as real as in most other movies overall a great movie and i highly recommend it to take your mind of lifes boring subtletiesfinal reviewmovies worth every cent of the ticket pricedvd purchase yes there is a very good chance this might be the start of a seriesrental if by no other means then absolutely,black_comedy
just see the movie im telling you right now dont read any review spoilers or not until youve seen the movienow i might be a little biased because i am absolutely in love with this movie it hit me in all the right places its hilarious its tragic its silly its dramatic ive never loved a set of characters from a horror film more  and thats the problem ive always had with zombie movies in particular now sure i like zombie movies but its always been about the zombies and thats why the movies are good in its about the living characters the first half hour of the film goes by without any zombies at all just hints in the background to the coming epidemic  it actually lets you get to know the characters before the horror which is a heroically refreshing change in things recently and when the zombies come hoo boy my favorite parts in the film come from the period in which the zombies just begin to appear and its so great that they dont just show up its so gradual that shaun and everybody else dont even notice it even though its right there in the background and oh the background humor god this movie has background humor i have so desperately missed subtle background humor in movies today right around when shaun leaves his day at work you should begin watching the background of every scene  and the fact that the background humor works so well is proof that edgar wright is a true director completely in control of every little detail in each individual frame of the film this movie is directed with such confidence that its almost ridiculous to believe that his only prior directing work is in tv shows  especially because he uses the widescreen format so well this is one of those movies that would just be a shame to watch in fullscreen actually there is nothing i can say about this movie that hasnt really been said already and this review has been so disorganized because theres just so much to say i could go into it more and more but it would be a waste of time for both you and me  just go see itgo see it go see it go see it,black_comedy
this is one of those ideas that is so obvious you end up hitting your head wondering why you didnt think of it yourself combine 28 days with the british genre thats most famous nowadays overgrown adolescents learn to accept responsibility and get lives in england shaun and his goingnowhere best friend are living lives of quiet desperation until his girlfriend dumping him and incidentally a zombie uprising causes shaun to get a clue i really liked this this is almost a perfect blend of humor and seriousness some people have knocked the film for this but i think its just right so much so that i actually got a little mistyeyed toward the end of the movie and i cant say ive done that with any other release this year particularly funny is shauns early cluelessness during the outbreakthe movie does postmodernism proud as its both a play on genre conventions and a celebration of them this is an extremely tough thing to pull off but they manage to do it with style because its mainly a riff on established conventions not something unique the movie does suffer from a certain diffuseness early on it looks like the theme will be modern society creates zombies by itself ala dawn of the dead but that soon gets abandoned for instance as theres too much other stuff to refer to still the characters believe in what theyre doing absolutely which helps a lot in these sorts of things jokes arent funny if the deliver is sniggering as he delivers them this is the sort of thing kill bill was trying to do i liked those movies but they never really congealed into more than the sum of their parts the way this did is essentially a goof an inside joke in some ways the definition of post modernism but its a very good example of it highly recommended,black_comedy
is far beyond what one might expect a typical british comedy laden with outlandish quirky dialogue and scenario its outlandish outrageous and absolutely insane working unconventionally as both a satisfying comedy and a gruesome blood fest it will probably go down as an instant cult classic offering pokesaplenty at a druginduced conscienceweary society enter shaun who seems oblivious and impervious to the gory catastrophe which has yet to even affect his daily routine until one of them threatens to take over his body along with todays obsession with kill and destroy everything which budges in ones path kill the zombies before they can harm us the dialogue itself is laden with standard vivacious british humor and substance i love my mum theres no i in team but theres i in pie and as an american ashamed to admit i have hardly explored this british culture i found the dialogue original convivial and refreshing only in a british comedy can decapitating zombies seem so fun and hilarious aside from constantly shelling out some appreciated humor the film is indeed a disgusting gorefest so be warned those who dispose at the mention of blood and guts this is probably not your movie of course the premise is rhetorically reminiscent of dawn of the dead strictly a horror film and this film makes light and dread on the town takeover of the zombies premise in such a clever if excessive and obscene execution towards the end the comedy premise sort of wanes away and the story deviates in various other tones drama motherson bonds romance shaun and liz inseparable and horror the violence at times becomes overwhelming and we lament the characters apparent doom perhaps this constructive deviation is less appreciated than if the film would have retained its initial premise of silly obscene grotesque comedy the ending is routine if overthetop but then again how else would one expect a zany film as this to conclude its silly fresh if obscene hilarious premise collaborating with the zombie invasion premise makes one insane droll and zany british comedy sure to be an international guilty pleasure hit  out of ,black_comedy
the cast attracted me to this dvd simon pegg and lucy davis in particular were the names that shone from the dvd case when i read the other cast names i knew this was going to be something specialand it didnt disappoint the cast is fabulous the direction is great and is a clever blend of uk blandness and comedy genius residents of the uk will recognise so many of the cast members but those outside of the country will still appreciate their abilitieszombie movies in the past have been numerous and predictable and is still very predictable this is a good thing  i found myself looking thirty seconds into the future and i was usually correct not a bad thing though  it almost immersed me into the filmmy biggest criticism is that this whole movie could have been and maybe should have been shortened into something like an hour special there are a few scenes additional to those included on the dvd extras that i felt could have been excluded when you see the deleted scenes you realize the reasons why they were deleted but also pick out other scenes that probably should have been left out toothe story was always going to be pretty basic the characters are great and they all have their particular relevance in the film the seamless inclusion of sky news footage of the outside world is great and is a brilliant touch and adds more ukness to the whole thing without it the movie would have been missing something american disaster movies always try to insert cnn footage to intensify the effect and sky is the obvious uk alternativethe reasons behind the zombie infestation is never revealed and i like that it would have made the plot far more complex it didnt really matter while i was watching the movie why these zombies had appeared and the characters didnt really dwell on it either  it was always about survivalits a great saturday night postpub movie that requires you to turn off your brain and switch it to funny mode its funnier if you are british because of the music references and a few of the actors but its still completely universal no pun intended never take it seriouslyi enjoyed it im giving it a seven out of ten its missing more points because i found a few scenes particularly unnecessary which makes me think that it could have been shortened to an hour for a tv special rather than a feature film but im glad that simon pegg is attempting these projects and have always enjoyed his material everyone involved in this movie is destined for more so remember their names,black_comedy
now this was a nice surprise finally a decent film and this is definitely one of the funniest ive seen in a long long time granted to like this movie it does require that you like films such as braindead and bad taste both by peter jackson  who by the way warmly recommends it as well  but the humour alone is worth itnice acting as well sure sometimes it may seem overacted but it fits the style of film perfectly and the very vivid expressions of the actors only makes it all the more funnyspoilers the title is totally fitting the leading character shaun is living a zombie like existence  not in the accurate sense of the word but you know what i mean  and the fact alone that he is walking amongst zombies and hours without noticing something is wrong is just hilarious i was rolling around the floor nearly splitting my sides from laughingthis is a film i truly recommend910,black_comedy
yes it was refreshing to see a nonhollywood movie particularly as this one doesnt pretend to be something it isnt i admit to having my doubts especially when i heard that filmfour was involved in the past ive either hated or loved films that theyve had a hand in wioth no middle ground and on balance i tend to hate them more than i like themhowever in sotds case i loved it i can imagine that some of the humour will go over the heads of nonbrits as the comedy in sotd is very british however that doesnt stop it from being a fun movie throughoutit was also nice to see the affectionate homages to classic zombie films of the past such as day of the dead et al there were probably more little nods at the genre than i noticed but the two ones that stood out to me were the entrailripping scene and right at the end as the credits roll the music playing is the music from dawn of the dead original as the zombies enter the mall and go shoppingas i note in the header this one is almost assured of becoming a cult movie it has all the right elements and none of the wrong ones watch it and see what you think,black_comedy
described as a british comedyhorror this is a very english film complete with englishstyle pubs english silly humour a generous splattering of gore and the sort of fishandchips romance that goes with english sitcoms shaun is caught amidst a growing epidemic of zombies  presumably sparked of by genetically modified crops attempts to save his girlfriend and mum and various others result in an illconceived plan to hole up in the local pub humorous references to people with deadend jobs abound and also to the attempts by shauns girlfriend to get him to live a little rather than hanging out down the pub with his deadloss mates the joke is carried even further when the group have to impersonate zombies so as not to be noticed even to the point of practice auditions cerebral stuff it aint but although its joke goes on for a little too long makes a reasonable stab at breathing new life into a dying brand of horror movie,black_comedy
hurrah  an example that we can make superb comedy films again a return to form for working title this film is the zombie movie most fans have been calling for over the last 5years or sothe premise  take the core elements of spaced that work lovingly infuse that sensibility into george a romeros universe chuck in some of the great examples of modern british comedy acting sorry love ricky gervais his the office work is not comedy acting tho  it is character assasination get the studio heads to leave the creative team alone et voila  100 minutes of great filmadmittedly there are some very parochial references in the movie some superb pastiche moments and sideways swipes the end reference to 28 days later is one of the best throwaway moments of recent cinema history but the film is worthy as a homage to romero for horror and zombie fans alikethis is destined to go down as a cult classic just a shame it may not pick up the immediate audience that dawn of the dead 2004 will get,black_comedy
this is a mustsee for any fan of the recent british tv comedy hits horror films or romantic comedies it has something for everyonesimon pegg and edgar wright bring spaced to the big screen but concentrate on what drives good movies tight writing strong stories characters you care about and fantastic performances they create comedy and suspense with top quality production values while keeping an original and unique outlooktheres a big laugh virtually every minute but it never becomes a parody or goes for cheap jokes at the expense of the believability the most endearing joke is that despite all the zombies and the mutilations its just about an ordinary bloke trying to get through life and keep his girlfriend so something for everyone,black_comedy
is quite probably the best comedy horror ever made it pays homage to romeros dawn of the dead and also his seminal masterpiece day of the dead edgar wright and company should be extremely proud of themselves its witty funny and gory all rolled into one and all of the audience that attended the very first mainstream performance at edinburghs ugc were in stitches of laughter from the beginning onwardsvisual effects were great but then they should be as they were created by bob mccarron of peter jacksons braindead in fact they were better than the make up on the recently remade dawn of the dead mostly because they were ultimately more explicitdont go to see this if your easily offended but if you like a good laugh and being scared then its a must see,black_comedy
this works  the premise of most of the spaced team writing a film could have meant 30 minutes of material being asked to fill an hour and a half in short it worked out better if you like any of spaced black books or phoenix nights youll like thisfor the rest of you this is a romantic comedy that just happens to occur while zombies are taking over the planet  shaun writer simon pegg is a complete loser who still works in an electronics store aged 29  he lives with his best mate from college who hates his best mate from primary school who came round to visit 5 years ago and didnt leave  hes so obsessed with shuffling through his normal boring life he fails to notice the entire world being overrun by zombiesas the title implies these zombies are very much from the resident evil  george romero school  theyre essentially useless and just shuffle round stupidly until you encounter them in packs at which point they become a problemthe zombies are not really the major point of the movie  unlike the americans who in bruce almighty try to have us believe a tv presenter living with jennifer aniston is a loser shaun really is  he spends his life at work or the pub and you do warm to him and the group of friends he drags round with himin short its funny but actually survives the serious bits too  probably the best britcom in ages,black_comedy
ok not many films impress me like this one did i dunno call me boring or whatever but most films just dont interest me but i have to say that this one did if youve watched spaced like i have and if youre a big fan of brittish sitcoms then youll really appreciate this film youll get this filmthe script is perfection it really was as good as i was expecting and after watching spaced that was a lot so no suprises there what did suprise me however was that unlike spaced the film contained a lot of drama and lump in your throat moments obviously they were quickly followed by another great oneliner but it made a change to see that the script writers could incorporate more than just comedy into the film and that the actors could pull it off convincingly without cheapening the show or making it seem like theyd included it for diversity but not thought that much about itspoilerspoilerspoilerspoilerspoilerspoilerspoilerok so maybe when his mother died the drama was a little forced after all we had no real reason to care about her so no matter how good peggs acting i just didnt buy the situation but when hes saying goodbye to his best friend it really struck me how talented this guy is its no oscar winning performance but then its not trying to be simon pegg really impressed me not only with his acting but with how caring the script was to certain situations at some points it felt like thered been no jokes for minutes which is normally unusual for this film and it was at times like these that you could appreciate the characters and see them as more than just 2dimensional slaughter monkeysspoilerspoilerspoilerspoilerspoilerspoilerspoileroverall i think this film is more than youd expect it to be theres an excessive use of profanitybloodviolence but its all acceptable as its all only a tool for the excellent script and acting and if you love britcoms like i do the cameos will please toobrittish comedy films or romzoms dont get any better than this if you liked spaced you have to see this if you have a sense of humour you probably should see this if you have nothing better to do on a friday night you should deffinitely watch this did i not mention that it is also a mindless zombiebashathon,black_comedy
when the new dawn of the dead film came out i wasnt very interested in seeing it but my friend told me about this film and i was there as soon as it came out the basic story is about a hapless man named shaun who works at an electrical store amongst younger more up and coming employees his girlfriend has had enough of him and dumps him after he messes up a restaurant booking in his grief he doesnt notice the strange people shuffling up and down the road moaning and doesnt pay much attention to the numerous news reports that is until a girl is standing in his back garden and he and his bone idle friend go outside to investigate i wont say anymore except it is a brilliant comedyhorror there was a lot of gore and everyone including me was laughing their arse off i for one will be seeing it again and again simon pegg is a genius as demonstrated by spaced and big train and i for one want his babies,black_comedy
i had been eagerly awaiting this film since i first heard it was on the cards some time ago having missed the first series of spaced i was introduced to it at a later date and loved the referential nature of the programmeboth to itself and previous moments in pop culture and film and thought it one of the most original comedies of recent times mainly because of the accessibility of its charactersusually i go to see comedy or horror with several mates but i couldnt wait for them to be around for this one the cinema was about half full  i was laughing out loud with at least two thirds of the audience i look forward to seeing it again with mates and seeing their reactions i can guarantee they will find it at least as funny as i didok so i came to this as a fairly avid fan of spaced and big train previously but this actually increased my  expectations of the project i would be interested to hear the opinions of people who never caught these however hopefully they will be encouraged to get hold of the dvds of thesethe menace builds quite gradually like the best of the genre with nods to cinematic history in the soundtrack from the start normality prevails at firsta convention but one that works wellit seems the zombies are beautifully ineptmore like original dawn of the dead thansay 28 days later or ed3 and provide many a comedic moment of indecisionviolenceed mark frosts character was a little less comic but more human than mike in spaced an berslob rather than a territorial all the same the relationship between him and simon peggs shaun aped tim and mikepeter serafinowicz was inspired casting as the twunt of a 3rd flatmate  provides a couple of genuinely scary moments bill nighy is slightly throwaway  he always reminded me of david davies of the fa and midlands today with that haircut but as always reliable as shauns stepdad also if you either liked or completely hated dylan moran in black books or how do you want me you might like this film wont spoil the reason whytheres a brilliant cameo bit that i wont spoil in the middlebut i suppose the main difference between this and spaced is that jessica stevenson only plays a minor albeit crucial role in this film i was a bit disappointed not to see mark heap or bill bailey in it  they would have made great featured zombiesshouldnt be using that wordthen again might have been over egging the puddingto be honest i dont think i have done the film justice thus far in summing up this is up there with evil dead 2 and demons as one of the funniest intentionally funny horror movies i have ever seen it may also be that i missed some of the references so i look forward to seeing it again after a bit more discussion with afficionado matesgo see this film if you like comedy or horror or preferably both you will not be disappointed,black_comedy
just come away from watching this film and was five paces from buying another ticket for the late showing its fantasticand uses a lot of comments you and your mates would have made watching zombie films in the past im very relieved that the film is excellent with good pacing and characterisation and even horror one of the characters deaths could be interpreted as a homage to a certain gruesome ending in the original dawn of the dead it also has a smidgin of the social commentary of the aforementioned film which its recent remake overlooked the feeling coming out of this film was of laughing all the way through it yet not remembering a lot of the jokes this will live up to repeated viewing and will become a classic,black_comedy
is easily one of the best films i have seen in recent times it is outrageously funny very intelligent and also touchingi can gurantee that you will want to see it time and time again just to pickup the little things that are going on in the background to call this spaced with zombies which i would consider a huge compliment is selling this film very short my girlfriend was in tears in parts of film both from the emotion and the laughsit is also great to see a film thats not been cynically americanised to make it sell better in the states to tell the truth i find this patronising to the americans if nothing else i had a friend from oaklahoma who saw spaced as a work of geniusto sum up go see this movie and make it the hit it deserves to be,black_comedy
first things first there have been negative comments about this film on imdb and other film discussion boards because people think its terrible that a film has been made spoofing george romeros excellent of the dead trilogy these should be ignored totally this film does them no injustice whatsoever but takes the well proven zombie formula and injects some home grown humour while still retaining the tension and jumpoutofyourseat scary momentsit should be seen as a compliment to romeros films im certain that was how it was meantanyhow go see and enjoy you wont regret it,black_comedy
honestly folks this was a very mediocre movie and certainly not worthy of even mention in this elite list part of the problem is too many young voters who dont seem to have any moral values this is not intended to categorize all younger voters as immoral there are many movies on this list which have no business being on it the usual suspect grind house dinnie dorky and children of men to name a few all these movies were good ones exept darko but dont belong on this list of the movies not on it which should be dances with wolves  papillon traffic and training day there are others that i didnt mention that should be on this list dances with wolves won 7 oscars including best picture traffic won 4 and was nominated as best picture training day wasnt nominated for major awards but denzel washington won oscar and ethan hawke nominated for supporting actor both put on absolutely wonderful acting jobs and papillon although it wasnt nominated for any major oscars it was nominated by golden globe as best pictureoh the deliverance should be on this listif i made any mistakes please point them out,black_comedy
i am sure that whilst the tongue in cheek jump on the zombie genre bandwagon appeals to a wide audienceit misses a great opportunity to have been as big of a cult film as they live  army of darkness these are remembered decades after their releasei say here and now in 3 years people will say shaun who always a great supporter of brit flicks i really wanted to enjoy this there were great moments but like eating a chinese takeaway you are never fully satisfiednevertheless a rainy night with nothing to do this film will suffice but look for more comedic moments in a christmas cracker might prove more fruitful,black_comedy
is a brit flick comedy romp which gaggles together a motley bunch of stereotypical young adults including a klutzy schmuck the hero his babe girlfriend the required gross fat guy sidekick etc and then plunks them down in the middle of a zombie flick the film conjures a mix of droll and outrageous humor which wears thin quickly and then turns into a bloody zombiefest which seems as endless as it is pointless with few lols to offer but the same sort of obvious tailoring for the irreverent and unsophisticated young adult crowd as a kevin smith dogma mallrats etc flick manages to clunk along with good production value a meager story and some cult appeal b,black_comedy
this was a very good film but like many recent films its score has been inflated on imdb thanks to young viewers that have no appreciation for anything made before they were bornhence older deserving films often are rated lower even though they are excellent films as a result lots of mediocre or above average films are given astronomical scores a great case in point the film memento now this isnt to say that is a bad filmits very good but it isnt so good that i would rank it in the imdb top 250 in fact its a darn clever film that manages to inject life into a dull genre zombie movieswhen youve seen one you think youve seen them all in particular its tongueincheek sense of humor was quite refreshing and the film had one of the best endings i have ever seeni was laughing about the shed scene for weeks excellent refreshing and cleverjust not top 250 material,black_comedy
i was thoroughly disappointed with this stupid movie i love great good and ok movies and this didnt really register four of us watched this and we laughed maybe 10 times during the whole film most of it was unintelligent predictable as all hell and plain not funny i love uk office but was sorry to see dawn in a stupid role and tim for 5 seconds doing nothing i really dont know how people think the director is so great believe me i got the clever jokes when they were present unfortunately it was mostly a fuck why are you doing that fest i hate comedys that are full of phony circumstance when it could easily have been written to be consistently clever if you have an above average iq and love funny dont watch this boring jay and silent bob level piece of crap to be fair its not complete crap it just kinda suckedps i laughed around 10 times for every jay and silent bob movie as well,black_comedy
this movie was ok but the thing that i didnt like about it was that it didnt have very many laughoutloud moments in it i mean i admit it had some funny jokes in it but most of them you just go hehheh and not hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha i prefer to go hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha rather than hehheh also this movie has an imdb score of 8010 come on it wasnt that good ive seen way better movies the shawshank redemption rain man clerks ii ghostbusters and jackass the movie just to name a few even motherfing toy story is better than this the acting in this film is alright and the script is creative but the jokes really arent all that funny the only parts i really lold at was the part where the zombified girl showed up in shauns yard and the part where shaun goes crazy dropping f bombs so yeah it was ok but id take scary movie over this any day,black_comedy
i gave this a 510 because it was comedy mixed in with horror nothing is watchable if it has comedy mixed in with the plot also as with my other comment on the other dead movie it has too much blood and gore i think they need to stop making these living dead movies its too sickening to watch not to mention its not a stable plot with stable characters that take their jobs seriously who wants to see a jokester play jokes and kill dead things anyways what this really needed was maybe a car chase a nice plot maybe a few serious characters and maybe a romantic atmosphere this entire movie was stupid what was going through the directors head anyways,black_comedy
i could have easily highlighted the performance of simon pegg and nick frost in this review for how good they were  and to some extent i will  but i want to focus on edgar wrights direction because i think that it beyond the wonderful script and performances is what makes this movie as funny and entertaining as it isi reviewed scott pilgrim vs the world a little while back and in that review i noted wrights use of quick cuts to add comedic effect and speed up of the pace of the film he continues to use that in and to even better effect the quick cuts and close ups of pegg and frost are often hilarious because of the way they move from action to reaction quickly it doesnt give the audience to process any other reaction than the one we see on simon peggs face at that given moment speaking of pegg his and frosts performances add another layer to the already funny film wright puts pegg and frost in positions to show off what makes them hilarious their friendship is front and center in the film  even to the point of interfering with peggs characters other relationship one scene in particular that i really enjoyed between the two friends is when the apocalypse first breaks out and they are trying to kill the zombies and realize that you have to aim at the head wright immediately cuts quickly to them in the backyard going through a vinyl collection bantering back and forth and trying to hit the zombies in the head with the vinyls its the combination of the absurdity of these two men trying to navigate something as serious as the zombie apocalypse in combination with edgar wrights direction that makes this movie absolutely worth your time,black_comedy
is notable for the kinetic directional style used by director edgar wright it is a comedyhorror film that is a suspenseful zombie movie and a british comedy the film puts the viewers on the edge of their seats and will have you laughing out loud at the most suspenseful moments in the film the audience is kept interested by the brilliant dialogue laughs and gore we are introduced shaun who seems to live a very flat and boring life and seems to be quite content with his short comings in life shaun has some serious growing up to do and his lack of direction and disconnect with the world around him makes him completely blind to the zombie outbreak that breaks out in london it is said that in a crisis is when you see the character of a man and for shaun the day of reckoning is now there are three central themes in this film are comedy horror and romance the film takes seemingly ordinary actions and make them oddly intense by using uncomfortable closeups loud sound effects and unexpected transitions the sudden transitions help to build suspense long before any of the real action occurs this is a very successful technique that can add suspense and tension around extremely humorous dialogue and character interaction the zombies are very slow in this film versus new films but it gives us a lot more dialogue between the charactersthe main method of portraying the comedy in the film us through irony the irony of how many times the outbreak is right in front of shaun and his best friend ed is hilarious shaun is a very easily lovable character despite his many flaws and you route for him to succeed a main staple of the film is the sound effects using intense and defined that is typically found in action movies for the normal everyday activities heightens the humor of the scene shauns lackadaisical life comes with an actionpacked soundtrack muting outside noises so the audience can focus their attention on the stumbling against an object or the opening of a soda can which becomes an epic action this film has that laugh out loud factor that will make it memorable for years to come,black_comedy
you remember this one dont you lots of laughs seeing the english mixing it up with zombies simon pegg and nick frost are a joy to watch on screenso much so that you will never feel the need to sit through paul highfivei just did you a huge favor i particularly enjoyed the moment when they try to kill the zombies by flinging classic record albums at them like oddjob and his deadly bowler in goldfingerwhat starts out as a simple story about a zhlub who wants to get his girlfriend back and sort things out with his mum turns into a comical tale of survival for shaun and his buddies and whats more english than the gang ending up at the winchester their favorite pub in a standoff with a ravenous zombie hordeas of this writing february 2013 this little gem did around 155m worldwide not bad for a small independent film be sure to look for penelope wilton from downton abbey as barbara its hilarious seeing isobel crawley as a dulleyed zombiethis movie has some big yucks thoroughly enjoyable mayhem with not a lot of deep soulsearching commentary,black_comedy
the first film in the blood and ice cream trilogy  which has edgar wright in the direction  and simon pegg and nick frost as the protagonist of trilogy is the funniest i still think the worlds end  the best of the trilogy  has very funny scenes  is an homage to zombie movies  simon pegg ta lot of fun nick frost this funny also  the cast is good and the performances of characters secondaries are competent  wright is a great direction  and the last minutes of the film  are frantic and fun  is one of the best parodies already made  and starts blood and ice cream trilogy excellently note 85,black_comedy
sometimes a directors style can overtake the story so much that the film suffers for it and that was the case with the more recent the worlds end in my opinion but is just too dang fun and filled with clich bending humor that wrights style proves to be the best thing about this horrorcomedythe first of the cornetto or three flavors trilogy focuses on a world in the midst of a zombie outbreak and two loser friends who dont really do anything with their lives buddies simon pegg and nick frost play the duo and brilliantly so i much preferred their bromance to the romance between pegg and kate ashfield who plays his girlfriend liz the enjoyment here is clearly with the fact that if a zombie outbreak ever did happen i would act exactly how these characters did i dont watch the news and rarely care to people watch when running to the store so i wouldnt be surprised if i didnt realize there was a zombieapocalypse going on either or even the gag where pegg struggles to shoot a shotgun these are all reallife scenarios put into a horror film and thus the comedy works better than expectedit doesnt feature an oscar winning script or world class actors but it is loads of fun with a kicka soundtrack paired with amazingly timed physical gags was and always will be a refreshing take on the zombie subgenre of horrorsoundtrackthe laughs hitrelatable lead characters7910,black_comedy

edgar wright 2004 is part of a threepart series which involve many of the same cast members throughout each film the trio is called the cornetto trilogy and it is in my opinion the best series of film comedy to date however is the first film i saw f the series and is still my favorite of all three hot fuzz in very close second this parody of the americanmade zombie film cult classics fuses comedy and horror better than any other film in its genre the film begins by giving the viewer a glimpse into shauns simon pegg systematic and unimaginably boring lifestyle we follow peggs character as he literally trudges through his daily grind we see throughout the day that he is in his midthirties and a lowlevel electronic store manager with stepdaddy issues if that doesnt explain his dull life then knowing that he lives with two roommates from college ed nick frost who sells weed for a living and pete peter serafinowicz who is a tightass and his love life is in shambles once we are given the initial tour of shauns personal life things start getting strange the film does an excellent job of giving us subtle hints that foreshadow the events of the next day the next morning shaun goes back to his initial routine as shown the previous day this time however the environment has changed dramatically the same extras that we saw roaming the streets are now either dead or aware of the horrific situation it is hilarious to see shaun being so oblivious and almost robotic in nature that he has no idea that anything is wrong until he makes it back to the house this is when the violence and starts to ensue and the way the characters interact with each other and the surrounding environment is perfectly executed mixing comedy and horror together in one beautiful symphony dont get me wrong the film is fairly gruesome if you get queasy from the sight of blood and guts be sure to have a barfbag near the language is also quite graphic and there is a pinch of lewd backofthemiddle school bus humor that isnt foreign to other edgar wright films the movie will bring out every emotion in you from laughter induced crying to sadness induced crying in all this film is an instant classic from comedy lovers and horror lovers all the same wright did an excellent job directing the second addition to the threepart series from the casting to the camera work he spared no expense to ensure the proper execution of a romanticcomedyhorror which is a genre that is typically filled with atrocities,black_comedy
such an amazing film many great quotes you can take away from it such as i dont know david and  ill stop doing it when you stop laughing etc its just a classic fabulous  the zombies are also very welcome and the comic timing is on point these two simon pegg and nick forst just work so well as a team bounce off each other amazingly all other character make this film as well i could literally watch this film over and over again it never gets unfunny which is great i also think it fit all kinds of ages couples families singles etc my mum is also a huge fan of the film one thing i would say is that they need to make a number two or something i think this film is underrated,black_comedy
is an excellent horror comedy with all the british wit you could ever hope for the film is littered with quips and one liners that are always good for a laugh shaun simon pegg is an assistant manager at a retail store just floating though life and not trying to accomplish anything special he lives with two roommates ed nick frost a deadbeat loser and pete peter sarafinowicz a pompous young professional liz kate ashfield is shauns girlfriend who dumps him early in the movie due to his gruelingly repetitive lifea sudden outbreak begins bringing the recently deceased back to life and spreads through bites from the zombies shaun and ed come up with a plan to save liz and shauns mother barbera penelope wilton the plan runs into its fair share of comic mishaps through the poor sometimes purposely sabotaged executionthe stereotypical zombie behavior is exploited with great success throughout the movie slow zombies are easy enough to walk around or knock over for an easy escape run into a herd of zombies just shamble through them making zombie noises theyll never know the difference in the end shauns plan wasnt as good as he had originally thought but he is able to impress liz enough to win her backif you like zombie filled comedies you would probably also enjoy zombieland another movie full of insults and quips to keep you laughing the whole time,black_comedy
is as good as comedyhorrors get in my opinion it perfectly sums up what this genre is all about  violence gore a silly storyline and hilarious characters its hard to believe that this movie is 12 years old but it is a timeless classici cant think of many better onscreen doubles than simon pegg and nick frost they are hilarious in all of the films in which they appear together this one is probably my personal favourite though it is brilliantly violent and gory extremely funny and thoroughly entertaining from start to finishis without doubt one of those films that everybody should watch at least once in their lifetime it is the definition of the comedyhorror genre,black_comedy
is the feature film debut of talented british comedy director edgar wright and while i absolutely adore his other films i really dont think any of them can really top this onesimon pegg stars as shaun last name never given and he does an excellent job portraying the slight average yet comedic side of the character but also the tormented dark side of the character seen most prominently when shaun is forced to shoot his mother after just watching her die which is a heartwrenching scene as we have grown to love both of these characters nick frost is ed shauns fat oafish lazy room mate who rarely gets up from the couch ed is a funny character to watch and although he is not a very good person nick frost makes you care about him so when he dies its another tear jerker scene everyone else does a really good job i especially love peter serafinowicz as shauns other room mate pete even though he doesnt get much screen timethe story is comedic and original portraying what i think a local zombie apocalypse would look like edgar wrights direction sizzles on screen i particularly love his fast zooms and great background jokes that take a second viewing to get i also love how the true reason for the zombie apocalypse is never actually revealed which means that they dont have to force in some scientific jargon to explain the plotdoes this film have flaws sadly yes though they are few most of the flaws come towards the end eds death was something not foreshadowed anywhere and all the swat members attacking at the end comes out of left field shaun really wasnt the hero of the story but really other than a few technical goofs thats it for detractorsoverall if you havent seen i would highly recommend it,black_comedy
you know that feeling when after dragging yourself through the dregs of modern comedies you find yourself asking where all the good comedies are well today i realized just how many crappy comedies id seen lately and so decided to watch one which i knew was good but to my shame had never seen before much to my delight it was every bit as good as id heardshaun simon pegg lives together with his best friend the fatoverweight ed nick frost ed works as an assistant in an electronics store not one block away from his house and edwell ed sells pot every now and then they also share the house with pete a businessman of course who cant tolerate eds uselessness shaun is having relationship troubles with not only his girlfriend liz but also his mom and stepdad then the zombie apocalypse breaks out and shaun will find himself on a journey not just to survive but also to repair said relationships its fun for the whole family reallywhats so refreshing about are the amount of visual jokes nary a minute goes by without there being a visual gag so many comedies are reliant on verbal punchlines that its nice to see a film thats aware of the possibilities of its own medium the way it repeats these jokes is also brilliant shaun walking to work is a classic example first he gives a homeless guy some change and the next day when the homeless guys zombified the absentminded shaun doesnt notice the difference so apologizes for the fact he has no change the way jokes are told purely through framing and editing is also fantastic like the way its slowly revealed in the opening scene that shaun and liz arent the only ones sitting at the tablei do have to say i found the drama a tad overbearing particularly towards the end i get that you need a story to prevent the film from becoming an aimless string of jokes but correct me if im wrong but i thought i was watching a great comedy all of a sudden everyone and their mothers are dying and its all a bit too dramatic for my tastes its not that these bits are poorly directed or acted thats not it at all rather it just feels a bit too out of place given the all the great gags that came beforei also think directorwriter edgar wright and cowriter simon pegg couldve done a bit more with the jumpscares theres a handful of jumpscares that are justthere jumpscares are one of the biggest clichs in horror so its a pity they didnt find a way to parody them or subvert them in some wayin the end the amount of terrific jokes and visual gags are so great in number any complaints are quickly rendered superfluous hot fuzz here i come,black_comedy
simon pegg plays shaun your typical not so grown up grown up shaun lives with his roommate has been recently dumped by his girlfriend and is constantly in contact with his drug dealing video gaming addict best friend ed played by nick frost his daily routine consists of his crappy sales job and often ends at the local pub however his happynot so happy life is brought to an abrupt change as the dead began walking the earth in search for human flesh shaun is quickly placed in a situation where his ability to plan and take charge is changed from not so much responsibility to being in charge of himself halfwitted best friend his mother his now exgirlfriend and her two friends as they fight to stay alive this specific film reminds me of an old 1985 classic the return of the living dead the idea behind each film is a carefree refusal of growing up until faced with the moment of no return in both films the characters are carefree and ready to party that is until all hell breaks lose in which case the characters realize that living is not all fun and games and it is necessary to make decisions and take actions in order to live ones life one of the strongest techniques used in this film was that of invisible and offscreen noise just as in the return of the living dead this technique gives the viewer a better understanding of what it was the characters were facing and going through during this terrifying yet somehow comedic event in the long run both of these films took a frightening situation and turned it into something fun to watch while also driving a deeper thought into the viewing audience that at some point in your life you simply have to grow up,black_comedy
is peculiar film because everyone seems to love it and say it is hilarious yet there is very little in the film to actually laugh atthe movie follows the premise of a man who is 100 clueless that the zombie apocalypse is happening around him and it isnt until too late that he realizes and must band together with his friends to find a safe place to hideoutthis sounds like a funny concept and it is a funny concept but it never really does anything funny with it or interesting for that matter what makes interesting is that it could almost be a legit zombie film if only it had more zombie action this is what makes the movie oddly obnoxious is that it is never really funny and it is never really a zombie film it is lukewarm mixing genres is always a great thing as long as you can get both genres in this movie is neither a good comedy or a good zombie movie so it becomes disappointing to watchthe movie definitely starts out with some good laughs and the first 20 minutes of the movie are genuinely interesting the build to the zombie apocalypse is great but the actually payoff isnt all that goodi think one of the biggest issues is that the movie plays and feels like a british tv show it is a british movie after all but it is shot a filmed more like a tv special than it is an actual film that might be a nitpick but towards the end of the film its campiness and dialogue starts to become really forced a lot of the jokes towards the end fall flat and the entire movie tries to get a lot of intense character interaction in one room but none of it works it just feels like a tv show script where people are yelling at each other for the sake of pointless dramaoverall not a horrible film but not a really great one the movie can never fully pick a genre and ends up taking neither genre i really wanted to find this film funny but only a few jokes could make me chuckle,black_comedy
its just one of those days when youre feeling a little dead i really dont know how to describe except its a comedy with zombies theres been other movies since it that morphed zombies with comedy like fido and the great zombieland simon pegg and nick frost lead the cast as two lazy roommates together with simons exgirlfriend mom and another couple they try to survive a zombie apocalypse what i really love about this movie is the humor isnt to in your face at least not all the time pegg and frost have great chemistry on screen together and kate ashfield is really good too this is one of those movies that is really easy to love the dialog is funny and the characters fire back at each other quickly sometimes fast dialog comes off as annoying but here it really works id have to say this is probably one of the best zombie movies ever made be it a straight horror or a comedy most zombie movies feel lame and uninspired because theres only so much you can do with zombies movies like and zombieland have really breathed new life into the genre though is really fun to watch and a truly hilarious movie,black_comedy
is hands down one of the finest and funniest sendups in the history of horror oh thereve been other outstanding examples like roman polanskis the fearless vampire killers or the mel brooks monsterpiece young frankenstein to cite but two but not so many that gets lost in the shuffle zombies shuffle in fact like many of the very best parodies this one boasts production values far superior to most of the type of movies it pokes fun at from beginning to end its played straight and that above all else is its funniest aspect its by no means a stupid tongueincheek winkwink nudgenudge kind of movie if youre tired of all the straight stuff shuffling around out there try,black_comedy
was released in 2004 directed by my favourite director edgar wright simon pegg and nick frost lead the cast in this zomcom movie based on shaun simon pegg a man in his late 20s trying to prove himself and regain his girlfriend and familys trust in him by leading them in a survival of a zombie apocalypse the music used throughout the movie is really fitting completely setting in with the movie this is a particular thing that i always pick up on with edgar wrights movies the music is always perfectly suited and to me thats somewhat important as you dont want to watch a movie with a random misplaced track playing even that minor detail can ruin the feel of a movie for someone there is a great attention to detail for example shauns tshirt gradually becomes more bloodied throughout the movie people who are turning into the zombies starts to look visually weaker as the process of the deadly virus starts to kick in and plenty more but i dont want to go into the movie too far and spoil it too much the story flowed smoothly but was choppy in the way some scenes were edited to be not in a bad way at all its actually a way in which i personally like and its the approach in which edgar wright seems to take with the blood and ice cream trilogy films which consists of hot fuzz and the worlds end overall is an amazing zomcom with a mixture of hilarious comedy that sets in incredibly well with the horror of the zombies and the sadness of the loss of people close to them this movie has became a classic and rightly so if you are wondering whether to watch this or not i encourage you to as it is an all time definite must watch,black_comedy
this film has everything a bit of horror comedy gore good acting usually when i watch a comedy horror it doesnt make me laugh it bores me its stupid and bad acting with this film it is not like that it made me laugh a lot it is a film i could watch over and over if you are looking for a good comedy horror then i would recommend this one over any othersa fun film to watch with friends or family a film that i am sure most people will enjoynick frost and simon pegg both are great actors and play great roles in this film they both know how a comedy should be i cant really fault this film it has everything a comedy horror should9 out of 10,black_comedy
this movie delivers on everything it promises a funny gory zombie film while it isnt a stretch to make fun of zombies because they are inherently humorous even when they are in dead serious horror movies they share the immobility and unscariness with their cousin the mummythis is a clever lowbrow laugh fest with its tasteless heart in the right place it refrains from raunchy laughs with some gas passing the low point and is smartly acted and cleverly written and there are quite a few nonhorror moments that are poignant and affecting if there is one misfire it is the exit of good old mum that wasnt handled very well and seems to be in contrast to its intentthis may be slightly overrated but not by much and is more entertaining than most teen oriented modern comedies in that it is intelligent without sacrificing its appeal to the most braindead of moviegoers the grossmeout crowd,black_comedy

and uses the genre for over the top laughs and funny humor that just never stops and after you watch the film your stomach will be hurting so much from laughter that happens throughout the film and the laughs making a classic horror comedy that ranks alongside other classic horror comedies such as evil dead 2dead by dawnthe return of the living deadan american werewolf in londonreanimator and peter jacksons dead alive just to name a few one of the main reasons is such a great film and cult classic is because director and cowriter edgar wright and lead actorstar and cowriter simon pegg have given viewers a silly and hilarious zombie movie that pays homage and tribute to zombie movies of the past such as george a romeros films and other great zombie films while at the same time mocking the zombie and giving viewers a movie that is creative and hilarious and original as well as stylish and imaginative the comedy and laughs in the film are funnywild and over the top with tons of jokesdialog and moments in the film that are smart and inventive but is also offbeat and weird and the laughs will have viewers in tears thanks to the main characters and the way they reacts to situations whether its dealing with zombies or themselves the comedy in sotd is also very subtle and clever with great and fun references to classic horror and zombie movies that came before this film and the references will go over most viewers heads when you first watch sotd but will be recognized and noticeable with multiple viewings whats also great about sotd is that there are moments that are played in a straight forward manner so the film doesnt become a spoof or parody although sotd is a comedy it never forgets that its a horror film as well because there is a few moments where the movie can be suspenseful and intense and can make you jump out of your seat the main character is an amazing character because he is an unlikely hero that would be able to deal with trying to help his friends and loved ones survive the zombie apocalypse with all of the problems hes having in his personal life as the film goes on we see shaun start to grow as a leader and man and its done in a funny and some times serious way with great character development that isnt always seen in zombie films and you root for shaun to succeed the zombies in sotd are wonderful and are influenced by george a romeros films because like in romeros films they look like regular people you see on the street the way the zombies are used in the film is masterful and hilarious and will you rolling on the floor laughing the screenplay by edgar wright and simon pegg is truly brilliant and filled with amazing and hilarious dialog that is memorable and done in a rapid fire pace that is funny and ingenious and will stay with you after you watch it the violence and gore in sotd is bloody and grisly at times but is done in a comedic way so you wont take it seriously the ending of the film is greatfunny and

a movie that brings perfect comedy into the zombie world brings topnotch perfection from outstanding perfection as simon pegg and nick frost take the screen shaun and his trusty bestfriend nick are without a doubt the best duos on film on screen i loved this movie with all my heart because its a classici can watch every single day that it will never get old drinking beers killing zombies and watching tv is a good way to go even the other cast members were pretty good i was surprise of how violent this movie was their was blood gushing out zombies with intestines hanging in place and a whole lot of biting every zombie lover in the world has to love for its brilliance i dont think their will ever be a movie like this anymore but thats okay cause this movie is gold,black_comedy
as i am no fan of scifi stuff i am very selective in watching related films i try to avoid films with lots of sophisticated technology achievements and vocabulary but i have enjoyed films with simon peggs participation  and i did not have to be disappointed this time as well he is not only a talented actor but he has a certain twisted mind for partaking in peculiar works where real fun and amusement lie in background actions andor witty comparisons peggs character is shaun an ordinary and childlike man attempting to get some kind of focus in his life as he deals with his best friend neighbour girlfriend mother and stepfather  all of them having their own problems and odd concepts skillfully played by british character actors at the same time shaun has to combat an uprising of zombies begin to take decisions both for himself and the others but he will still remain almost an ordinary citizen not fabulous superman for couple of hours as we see in most similar us moviesthe plot is strong and smooth many scenes and lines make you giggle and politically incorrect ending scenes are really enjoyable recommended to all those who would not take destroying humanoid zombies very seriously and can withstand the idea that the good can die too,black_comedy
is a silly zombie flick with strong undertone of seriousness theres is no doubt that it is meant to make us laugh but at the same time it has a number of dramatic scenes the couple story is the running thread but its not the meat on the bonemost scene are a comic setup never failing to have the audience roll back their eyes in incredulity toward the ends come the more dramatic ones and those are the one who make you thinkthe dialogs very real and flow at a good pace the editing is done in a quick efficient manner the story is very interesting the zombie threat and its working are imaginative the acting is good simon pegg nick frost and kate ashfield giving us the best performancesoverall its a very solid entertainment in brain dead wayits a must if you dont mind zombies and a bit of gore,black_comedy
while the central action of this film is a fight for survival in the wake of the zombocalyse its really about growing up shaun finds himself trapped between his best friend who represents his past and his girlfriend who could be his future everyone in his life is urging him to ditch his immature best friend ed so he can growup and enjoy the next stage of his life which will include all those grownup things like career and marriage but shaun still cares for ed they share a lot of good memories and ed can always make shaun laugh this is a very relatable conundrum for those in their mid to late 20s what makes this movie so funny is how it shows what it would be like for real people to be faced with this extreme situation it also has some real serious moments that are very touching and honest httpamandalovesmoviescom20120317shuanofthedead,black_comedy
zombie apocalypse as joke material is really nothing new in broad daylight the slow and mumbling undead are actually pretty pathetic sight as long as you dont let them get too close i still dont think that the subject matter has ever been approached quite this way because when you really look at it in the zombies arent the source of the comedy theyre actually a credible threat to the everyday joes that inhabit this film rather most of the humour in this film stems from the sheer stupidity of mankind because lets face it many of us wouldnt make it for a day if the gates of hell were to be opened but there would be some individuals who against all odds would survive through sheer dumb luck and thats this filmthe director edgar wright along with the two main actors simon pegg and nick frost would later go on to make hot fuzz one of my favourite comedies of all time and a lot of the same ideas show up in this film the same bland noninterest in the face of danger bizarre circumstances happening in the background and the absolutely brilliant interaction between pegg and frost are the saving graces of this film along with the usual zombie jokes that youd expect from a film like thisthis isnt hot fuzz however though its still rather good what i think it misses are likable main characters the main characters in this film are really really urban and bland theyre so boring and so lost in their everyday lives not to mention the zombie apocalypse that its hard to root for them i found myself cheering for the zombies occasionally when some of the more obnoxious characters were killed whether or not this was intentional i dont know but it does the film no favoursthats my personal interests interfering with my viewing experience though because ive never really liked these kinds of characters that are so helpless and so socially awkward that even the local computer nerds pick on them some might find them hilarious however so i cant really call it a flaw of the film its just not something that appeals to measide from that grievance the film is very good the plot twists are very unexpected but in a good way the action scenes are not bad and the story while a bit weird in some parts manages to work for some incomprehensible reason any fan of zombie parody should definitely give this one a watch,black_comedy

the tyranny of a prince in an oligarchy is not so dangerous to the public welfare as the apathy of a citizen in a democracy  charles de montesquieu edgar wright directs a spoof of george romeros serious zombie series and the comedic zombie movies of john a russos return of the living dead franchise the film flattens and cheapens the politics of romeros work but is faster funnier slicker and more affable than all of russoswhile romeros films went out of their way to encapsulate the social and political mores of different decades night of the living dead 1960s america dawn of the dead the 1970s day of the dead the 80s land of the dead the 90s diary of the dead and survival of the dead the first two decades of the 21st century what shaun says is more unconscious the modern world breeds zombies and stifles ambition being a zombie hampers upward mobility upward mobility is necessary to draw in women and women are all that rescue zombie spouses from total slothful zombiedom the films climactic dues ex machina even features an army being led by a woman meanwhile all couples embrace being zombies and all eventually become content in their zombie society as all heavy work is outsourced to lesser zombies freeing middleclass zombies to work in their white collar zombie society and watch zombie tv and play zombie video games the film advocates zombiedom because all zombie man and his zombie audience want in their shared perpetual stupor is media stimulation sex a relatively nontaxing 9 to 5 job and various consumer pleasures you are fine being a zombie you want to be a zombie being a zombie is good is easy as long as you have electricity a wedding ring and other zombies are doing all the manual labour unlike romeros films all this is sanctioned rather than presented as being abhorrent see the 2007 remake of invasion of the body snatchers which likewise embraces defeatism and advocates that its cast and audience become alien podpeople youre better off without your brain submitincidentally the recent zombieland does exactly what does using zombies as being representative of an aching longing for 1980s consumerism the sweet brainless embrace of video games atari ghostbusters bill murry 80s fantasy etc contrast this to romeros land of the dead7910  though very funny and stylish this is sitcom level drama and humour worth two viewings,black_comedy

this is my review of it is a horrorcomedy that is very enjoyable to watch it mixes my two favorite genres together to make a very laughable blood fest this movie is about two friends pegg and frost who live together they live boring lives until one day a zombie outbreak strikes of course like any other zombie movie it does not say how the infection started it just kind of appears they do their best to survive the infestation they face by rounding up friends and going to their favorite pubthis movie is filled with laughs from pegg and frost very good actors in comedies in my opinion and it is also filled with lots of blood and gore to keep to the traditional zombie movie stylethis movie is definitely worth a watch i kind of think they should make another movie with the same characters but make it a vampire comedy and call it from dusk till shaun what does everyone think,black_comedy
this movie i saw by accident and went into it with no idea what to expecta horrorcomedy moviedidnt think either would work but i was very wrong the movie speaking takes a couple minutes to get used to due to heavy accents but after that its a very enjoyable movie over and over with many parts that bring tears to your eyes you laugh so hard the plot is the typical zombie movie but with a funny angle and good acting dont want to really say anymore than that since dont want to give any spoilers but again would highly recommend sitting through this movie at least once if you havent seen it yet,black_comedy

nick frost and simon pegg were delightful in this parodylike british zombie flick shaun simon pegg is a tv store senior staff or oldest who had gone nowhere with his life his 3year relationship with his girlfriend just ended and he had no idea what his next move is in the beginning of the film you see the director trying to foreshadow upcoming events like flashing the news and the radio after all of that shaun and his friends still got no idea that zombies were coming to town finding out that they were possibly going to die shaun decided to go to a safe place the winchester the bar that he and ed frost always goes to for comfort also deciding to pick up his mom and his exgirlfriend shaun battled through a pile of bloody zombies in a brilliant way walking through the streets as though they were zombies hitting a zombie in a musical rhythm and missing as he shoots the zombies are great work of director edgard wright its got a feeling of sensation from dawn of the dead but it also has witty humor from its characters unlike most other zombie flick shaun is an uptight store manager that wants to get his life together ed is a fat loser who lives with shaun and play video games all day when theyre together funny even though i stress on how funny it is is still a horror film with much appreciation for the bloody gore and scares that a typical zombie flick has,black_comedy
this has to be one of my favourite films of all time i love simon and nick this has to be one of their best films the catchy one liners and phrases are quotable and memorable the jokes and gags are so funny and it has a really great storyline although it being a comedy horrorthe zombies still look real i guarantee you will love this film it contains relateable humour and tragedy the other actors are really good and it just makes the film really believable its such a funny film and i definitely recommend it if you havent seen it then it is definitely a must seesimon and nick are great actors and i recommend you watch their other films too,black_comedy
smashing the zombies head running over a bunch of zombies and piercing a zombie by iron bar if those things happen in horror movie i would be terrified but in this film those things become absolutely hilariousthe movie was very funny and its safe to say it was worth to watch just one thing i was little confused is the movie contained some sad scenes which never turned into funny occasion i expected a whole movie is just comedy and nothing more so i thought it might be better if they just eliminated the sad scenesanyway if you are looking for some grade b horror movies go rent the other movies this is not you are expecting but if you are looking for great zombie movie this movie will be it rent it today,black_comedy
when i started voting movies on this site i used to vote after checking the genre plot following other people views and all other useless stuff but not any more now i rate 1010 if i feel that the movie was really fantastic this is my first movie review because i found this movie really worth reviewing this movie is certainly the best zmovie i saw zombieland being secondthis movie illustrates that without sense of humor the earth would perishthis movie is really original and innovative it is a comedy so people may take it lightly but there is gripping gore in this movie as well some shots are truly thrilling and make you hold your sits tightly thumps up to the director for portraying even zombie with sense of humor i think this is the only movie which did that i can watch this movie again and again and again ,black_comedy
i heard of this movie a couple times but never saw it cause i thought it would be like all the rest of the make fun of horror movies type of film i bought this movie at a used dvd store just because it was on sale and thought i might as well see it it is by far one of the creepiest and funniest movies that ever came into the film world after you see this you will understand why its on the top 250 list of imdbcom the all british cast made this movie even more wonderful than if it was an all american cast i honestly have never laughed so hard at a movie and yet been so freaked out at the same time the only little problem i had was the ending is that it just wasnt how i thought it would have ended but it was pretty funny none the less it is a good ending and a great movie i would definitely recommend this to anyone who loves horror movies and comedies the idea that all of a sudden there is a scary moment and then all of a sudden a joke comes out of no where is the perfect combination especially for this cast and this production crew the movie is about an hour and a half long and i only wish there had been a little more maybe just another half an hour it would completely be worth it every little moment and coincidences are extremely deliberate and its fits so wonderfully so once again in conclusion and so on and so forth this movie is a must see for really anybody who can accept the same amount of scary and funny in one movie,black_comedy
the filmmakers really played on the fact that british people are often impossible to good effect within the parameters of this movie unfortunately the way in which british people are frequently impossible is not always something you can forgive and that element makes this film good but not excellent that someone could be every annoying thing and not be also considered a form of evil is maybe what this film is mocking so maybe it is further ahead of the curve than i am giving it initial credit for good acting from the team of actors that also made the film hot fuzz which is the better film to me i found the annoying traits that are played upon in this movie to be a bit much at about the one hour point but like i said maybe they are trying to make fun of just how irritating people can be as they are in effect personifying evil by having so many traits that are supposedly there to ward away evil that nothing is ever said about anything is pure england and is like dealing with the just deceased in a way and that the continuous counter reaction of everything is fine when it most definitely is not has the ultimate effect of destroying every scrap of possible good in a situation good zombie film funny in places with an interesting and intelligent sardonic sub text,black_comedy
i have lost count of how many times i have watched this film now but it is still great every timeit is a good mix of subtle humour and very obvious over the top comedy the balance is important and they get it spot on so there is something for everyonethe two main characters chemistry is perfect they are friends in real life which is an important part to making the film workthe story is fairly basic but it does keep you interested even though it is really a stupid zombie film for which there are hundreds to choose fromthis is not really a zombie film but a comedy with zombies in it there is violence but it mostly for the comedy effectone of the best comedies ever never mind british comedy a must see,black_comedy
i guess i got already inoculated by previous zombie movies ive seen all of them coated with serious story lines some were convincingly magnificent eg dawn of the dead some are slightly stupid like 28 weeks later while others where plain stupid but entertaining such as land of the dead but when it comes to disgust and entertainment as far as i can remember braindead had made laugh almost to death while the rest of my friends squirmed and screamed in disgust watching it this is the first time i saw a british film that made this zombie hype excitingly and worthily watchable since i saw simon pegg first in hot fuzz i know he excelled well more enough in hes performance here is even deeper his comedic talent isnt saturated to the extent of impairing his dramatic abilities nevertheless the film worked well it was hilariously charming and plain simple scary the cast were also awesome see kate ashfield there for example shes a straightforward understanding simple and frank girlfriend of shaun simon pegg but just like ed diane david and the rest of the cast swayed me with their offhand and persuading performances the comedy and bit of drama was cool it mixed well how the story of the film progressed very much anticipating but if i were to compare its cheesy factor of horror zombie flick familiarity i guess braindead was cheesier in that term but the rest was cool and brilliant i deem its cooler than the latter ive watched this film few times and i get to love the character more and more it never wears out for my taste,black_comedy
since mel brooks days of satire parody as a genre has been just about limited to the massproduced from the makers of scary movie films  in which scenes from the films they parody are restaged but with groin kicks and fart jokesrather brings parody back to life by playing around with the genre it parodies in this treatment of the zombie movie the main characters barely notice anythings changed  why would they when theres issues with the landlord the girlfriend and the stepdad its only when someones about to have a bite taken out of them that anyone reacts to the oncoming apocalypsethe reason works is that instead of just looking for holes in movies to make fun of it presents itself as just another one of the movies that it parodies and with the comedies hot fuzz and spaced under their belts i can say that edgar wright his cast and crew are the most competent satirists of the past decade,black_comedy
when my brother decided we were going to watch my initial reaction was oh god this should be a load of rubbish well how very wrong i was shaun pegg is your typical nohope loser with family problems work problems girlfriend problems and friend problems however he transforms into a warped version of a hero when zombies attackthe first half is brilliantly scripted with many a laughoutloud line and great delivery from pegg and frost who worked together very well the all star cast of british legends such as bill nighty dylan moran and nicola cunningham work very well too frost was particularly good and i found i was quoting his lines for days afterwardshowever as shaun suddenly realises hes in the midst of a zombie apocalypse we change from this laughaminute comedy to a very well performed actionhorror film peggs acting is outstanding especially during the scenes when he mum is dying the visual effects were topnotch too  i was glad to see they didnt go down the traditional obvious fake blood route and i found myself truly believing that they were surrounded by zombies the extras should be credited too because they were very convincing but the comedic value still isnt lost and i found that i was laughing crying and cowering in fear all at the same timei highly recommend you watch this film even if zombies arent for you truly one of britains greats,black_comedy
i will start of with the plot on friday shaun is in a rut at 29 hes coasted through lifeand still hasnt gotten very far usually winding up at the local pub the winchester his roommate ed looks up to himwhen he can take his eyes off the tv that is liz is reevaluating their relationship particularly after shaun fails to do something special for their anniversary on saturday that day there are train delays people fainting in the streets tv news reporters on unexplained calamities no it cant bebut it isthe dead have risen saturdays isolated incidents mushroom into a fullon zombie assault and once daylight breaks its sunday bloody sunday as manners and flesh take a beating its time to separate men from meat humans from zombies and living from undead shaun and ed grab whatever is at hand to repel the attacking zombies summoning reserves of strength they didnt know they possessed and straining muscles they forgot they had rounding up friends and family they press on towards the sanctuary of the winchester all that stands in their way are hordes of the flesheating undeadthis movie is not scary at all like braindead aka dead alive which is scary then this movie but this movie did have some very gory scenes which i really likethis movie was absolutely hilarious from start to end there also added some drama in this movies not too much but mainly focused on the jokes the zombies make up effect were really good and there was one of deaths scenes that really stood out and its was really gory which i really likedthe acting from simon pegg kate ashfield nick frostlucy davis bill nighy penelope wilton and the rest of the were greati going to give this movie a 8 out 10,black_comedy
im not a george a romero fan putrid expeople tearing flesh with their teeth is not my idea of fine filmmaking still what seems to appease critics is the social commentary found on romeros saga of the dead either way the filmmakers revolutionary concept of horror and zombies spawned a new generation of movies that made their attempts to either honor romero or improve his work 28 days later may be the best example of the latter however most of those zombie flicks are known for being schlocky formulaic and tasteless particularly resident evilthis homage to george romero by british comedians simon pegg and edgar wright is one of few that takes the concept to another direction the script actually isnt focused on the zombie invasion at all shaun is a frustrated man with a job that goes nowhere a friend that while a faithful companion only drags him further back domestic problems with his mother and stepfather and most importantly a turbulent relationship with liz whos fed up with shauns lack of motivation and threatens to leave him all of this happens while an apocalyptic phenomenon strikes london where people stop living and turn into flesh eating zombieswright and pegg blend this strange mix up of genres so brilliantly that it honors its tagline rom com zom and becomes unique in its kindits not the airplane style of parody which usually means a pointless story made up with the sole purpose of making fun of a specific genre of films it actually tells a really serious tale most people may not get that this whole horrifying zombie phenomenon actually helps shaun in moving on and leaving his no good lifestyle behind the tragic loss of his mother and ed makes a necessary change on shaun as he no longer has someone to drag him back to his frustrated routine lifethe reason of the wide appeal of this film is its versatility romero fans while find it a laugh riot people who have never seen a zombie movie in their lives while find it extremely amusing the cinematic homages by edgar wright are quite funny to the educated film scholar and the technical aspects are quite flawless for film criticsits a favorable stereotype the fact that british humor is light years ahead of american or much farther of mexican humor the jokes found in are original creative and most likely never to be repeated again had this film be made by incompetent hacks passing as writers in america the jokes might have been vulgar and with stupid punchlines there are scenes that arent just incredibly funny but their creation is technically ground breaking like shauns two trips to the store done on a single shot each since im no romero fan the homages went largely unnoticed for me unlike hot fuzz but that doesnt affect the fine technical mastery involved in the filmit doesnt matter if you love zombie films or hate them the innovation in this british comedy will make the most avid living dead genre detractor thrilled and off their seat with laughter along with hot fuzz a must have,black_comedy
meet shaun hes kind of stuck in a boring job his best friends a bit childish his girlfriend is on the verge of leaving him and hes not his father sorry step dads biggest fan oh also the walking deadwe dont use the zedword just attacked where he lives in this pastiche of the horror genre there are actually proper scares terrifying sequences and wellestablished creepy atmosphere the laughs are the main point and this does garner a ton of them with cleverness black andor british humor incredible subtlety silliness and satire this moves a mile a minute with excellent pacing never overstimulating and slowing down here and there occasionally including some impeccably genuine true and heartfelt drama and backstory the characters are credible wellwritten and fleshedpun intended out very nicely this is dense with detail and warrants rewatching the actors have definite talentnearly every performance is flawless in addition to being extremely funny pegg ashfield frost nighy etc all of them astounding in both respects im rather impressed that the transition from televisioni have not yet been able to catch any of spaced but i certainly am intending to went so smoothly and perfectly almost everything here works out the editing and cinematography are marvelous this is so packed with references to and spoofs of stuff in the flicks that inspired it i implore you make sure to have seen the george a romeros trilogy concerning the subject as well as the three evil dead movies before this reservoir dogs too the dialog is magnificent welldelivered and utterly quotable this has a great plot that develops well throughout the special effects are amazing completely convincing there is frequent strong language some disturbing content and a lot of bloody violence and gore in this the dvd holds a commentary track by simon and edgardo note that they cuss and are in general outspoken in it which is absolutely worth the time deleted scenes with the option of hearing the thoughts behind cutting them featurettesa couple of them have pages here on the site and i will review them there outtakes makeup tests a sfx comparison production trailers for the film and photo galleries theyre all wellproduced i recommend this to any fan of romantic comedies with zombies 810,black_comedy
truly is a masterpiece one of the greatest films of all time perfectly cast amazing direction and a truly original script it has smart comedy grossout humor and touching and relatable scenes and characters truly defined by its characters and comedy this film is a horror film gone right if youve seen spaced or missed out on this and saw hot fuzz you know the team of edgar wright simon pegg and nick frost is always going to be immensely entertaining smart and hilarious this is not a spoof as much as it is an homage as is hot fuzz where this is an homage to films like of course dawn of the dead hot fuzz is an homage to 70s and 80s action films this film has something for everybody and it has hit it to the tee for me this movie is absolutely perfect and is one of my favorite films of all time the truetolife relationship between shaun and ed with shaun and liz all of the cast is perfectly chosen while the rest of the film has you either laughing crying or in a bittersweet state the feelings you get from this movie is a feeling you should get from just about every great classic comedy happy and completely enthralled into the plot the truly perfect balance of comedy horror and romance they are not disrespectful or mocking the zombie genres history they make it better one thing is certainly for sure george a romero has officially been topped,black_comedy
after his girlfriend dumps him loser shaun pegg must get his life together only britain is subjected to an outbreak of zombies that is threatening life all over the worldafter the success of tv series spaced in 2001 simon pegg nick frost and edgar wright would continue their rise to the top with the blood and ice cream trilogy with this 2004 release the first instalment to the frankly brilliant saga so far that takes the concept of horror and love to a whole new and tantalizing levelbritain it is fair to say has created sound astounding horror flicks over the years danny boyles 28 days later portrayed a horrifying prospect of a country subjected to a rage virus and the director created some breathtaking scenery by deserting the capital for atmospheric purposes even stanley kubricks the shining was filmed partly in britain and that is perhaps one of the most renowned horrors today along with alfred hitchcocks psycho the last couple of years we have seen more teen horrors than we need from the hole to donkey punch and recent release tormented we get the general picture of teen angst juxtaposed with some blood thank you and so here we have a brand new vision horror with a wonderful spurt of comedyis a rarity the comic pairing of frost and pegg will never be appreciated enough and the quick very quick montages of edgar wrights bring astounding appreciation to the viewersthe release brings around a wonderful collection of justification to a variety of meaningful topics such as relationships parenthood friendship and survival with a wonderful inspirational get your life together ideology the fact the scripting is hitting hard at some important issues it would seem hard to cram in any type of comedy but behold the marvel of the pairing of pegg and wrightfrom throwing classic records at zombies to the imitations of the dead this is a comic gem that will consistently make you smilepegg and frost have become one of britains best comedy duos with this film the marker in which they hit the big screen in groundbreaking fashion from frosts ape impressions to peggs likable loser antics we can sit back and enjoy the partnership and playful banter between the two actorswrights direction breaks boundaries with the montages but there is a skillful approach to the handling of the zombie attacks when outside the winchester there is a very well handled approach to the way the dead are acting and wrights sublime setup helps adds a chill and a sweet comic touchthis picture is simply the beginning of the trilogy with hot fuzz establishing the actors and directors on to bigger and better things but what a hit shaun is,black_comedy
i am a big fan of the spaced series and big train so i was familiar with simon pegg and his excellent writing and acting i went to see this film at the cinema with a mate who introduced me to spaced when we left the cinema my mate was still buzzing off the film i was fairly quiet about the whole thing thinking to myself that the film really could have been a lot bettersure theyve taken on the zombie movie genre highlighting the numerous faults with the premise and along the way theyve made us chuckle along however this film fails in a number of ways and could really have been an absolute classic in airplane termsthe primary factor that spoils the movie is the unrealistic nature of nick frosts character and how a friend like him would not be a friend were he to be like he is all the time he was just too annoying to be accepted and taken as a realistic character pegg essentially plays the straight man to frosts funny man the biggest contributor to frosts annoyingly poor character has to be frosts poor acting when compared to the rest of the cast this could be a reflection of the script which also could have been better or even a reflection of edgar wright and how he isnt quite there yet with his art but is closefrost spoils the film for me and for that reason this film is not in any way a classic its worth watching a couple of times but to be mentioned in the same breath as films like airplane is something people are too quick to do its decent but not as good as it could have been with a bit more tweaking and the replacement of nick frost with a good actor,black_comedy
when spaced hit our screens for the first time in 1999 it became a cult classic everyone was sure edgar wright could never top but less than 5 years later came the masterpiece that is what could be seen as a movie take on the ohso lovable spaced edgar wright and simon pegg push things to the limits with this lip biting romantic zombie comedy but this film is not your typical hidebehindyoursofa zombie movie in fact when you break this movie down you realise that the zombies show rather small significance to the main story in which wright and pegg try to get across therefore this movie is for everybody it reaches out to all audiences even those whos stomach turn at the slight thought of a bloodcurdling zombie hacking away at someone can be comforted by the fact that behind all that makeup the extras come in the forms of professional comedian joe cornish and the lovable michael smiley better known as his role as tyres in spaced the brilliant mixture of british humour and irony displayed in this movie is what gives it the edge that separates it from all other movies lines such as go live in the shed or next time i see him hes dead almost foreshadow the ending of the movie subtly enough that we may not even realise the beauty that comes with this perfectly shot movie is that even from the opening sequence as each character is brought in one shot at a time to the end there isnt an unquotable unmemorable and unlovable moment in it moving onto the cutting edge cast that comes with this epic movie the list is almost endless from cameos to characters there isnt a single actor missing from this movie with appearances from martin freeman dylan moran bill nighy and peter serafinowicz youll never feel the need to watch another movie again saving the best to last we come to the dynamic relationship of the movie between simon pegg and nick frost in which its hard to tell where frost and peggs friendship ends and shaun and eds friendship begins a relationship absolutely crucial to the popularity of the blood and ice cream trilogy did i forget to mention the kick ass soundtrack no i was just leading up to that part every film geek knows a decent soundtrack makes for an even more impressive movie for example would the graduate be half as good without the simon  garfunkel soundtrack no probably not opening with the specials and ending with lemon jelly wright has achieved an absolute perfect balance to finalise an already perfect movie additionally anyone who can say theyve watched this movie and dont automatically think of the legendary snooker cube moment when they hear queens dont stop me now is a liarthis movie is a not spoof but a vital tribute to so many well loved zombie classics and a vitality to our film industry is a crucial must see movie and i would not give it any less than a ten out of ten rating,black_comedy
this is the much funnier and enjoyable comedic version of night of the living dead id have created years ago just far more british it has several references to the original notld movie and a lot of nonfamiliar british references do the english really talk like that simon pegg is a likable loser and his best friend nick frost is a likable idiot together theyre an incredible comedy team making this a definite cult classic i love the recurring gags and the predictable foreshadowing instances plus the character motivations like simon fretting and reacting as nick tosses his prized record collection a lot of it really is common sense in the face of confusion as well as taking the most difficult way to a solution the way people really act and thats what makes this movie in so many ways than one,black_comedy
this film is a comedic version of how an unlikely hero saved the day in a zombie outbreakshaun is a loser but he is stimulated to change for the right direction indeed he changed so much that he becomes a well organised leader in an escape plan ed is so annoying which forms the comedic backbone of the film barbara is shockingly simple minded that i wanted to knock some sense in her on a couple of occasions this basically means that the characters are all very engaging and well portrayed the plot is good the suspense is maintained throughout and it keeps me on edge very often i am not a fan of horror films but i like this one,black_comedy
i have never watched zombie subjected films like dawn of the dead which kids it if you have no information about the film before the watching and want to control of subtitle synchronization youll be get wrong because of seeing fear scenes but its completely comedy filmall the characters are quite original eds a very fantastic and i laugh at his jokes during all the film to me he is the hero of film more than shaun and already he finishes with an amazing scene ed isnt a forgettable man he kids also the heros fat and stupid friend image shaun is also amazingit shouldnt be counted as surprise seeing it in imdbs top 250 its aim not to criticize just zombie films also the clichs in cinema i celebrate the whole staff doing a reasonable film with a small budget like a 4000000 as a summarys success isnt surprise but it could be shown at the top of the surprising films,black_comedy
by way of explanation of this review i should say that ive never been that in to comedies my wife makes me laugh my friends make me laugh even a book can make me laugh but for some reason the number of movies that make me laugh are very few and far between for all the hype as being one of the funniest films in years was amusing throughout and on several occasions did in fact make me laugh which from this reviewer is very high praise indeedthe story is pretty simple with peggs shaun leading a whos who of british sitcom actors through zombie infested city streets to holeup romerostyle in a local pub the zombies are never very scary and theres never really much of a sense of real peril the script contains genuine warmth and affection and pegg and frost are great possessing comedic chemistry and timing but judging from the outtakes you wish that they would allow themselves the indulgence of diverting from the script as their improvisational skills are often far funnier than the finished dialoguea last act disemboweling is the movies only real nod to the visceral and messy violence of the genre as can be judged from its 15rating in britain i feel a certain amount of pride in the fact that england is able to finally produce popular movies without pandering to an american audience but the lavish praise that has been heaped on this movie seems a little overthetop but what can i say ive just never been that in to comedies,black_comedy
im not really a fan of zombie films but it recently seems like theyve kinda ganged up on me is therefore a nice breath of fresh air in a genre that has become quite repetitive and selfreferencing what the film does is combine lighthearted comedy but is also a good zombiefilm on the sidethe films definite highpoints are its depiction of how people deal with a problem of such a bizarre nature the human drama in all its cheesiness provides the perfect outlet for the films dark comedy which in turn keeps the film from becoming too serious even during more emotional moments such as philip and moms deathsthe film also doesnt fail to see to the needs of zombie fans and actually contains quite a bit of gore though it is rather bleak and gory a film deep down it is actually a romantic comedyis the quintessential date movie,black_comedy
i have to say that this was an excellent zombie film the biggest problem i have with most zombie movies is that everyone in them is just a clich but this movie manages to give each character a pretty well developed entity to work with simon peggs character is the most rounded and i have to say very well acted i felt as if i were attacked by zombies this is basically how i would act the scenes where brevity was needed it was actually well done and that is because the characters were real when simon shoots his mother is a surprisingly moving scene the standoff where funny is actually pretty heart felt in most movies where a lot of people are going to die i dont care who lives or dies but i actually cared with simon pegg dies nor not for a while there i thought he was actually going to die but the ending was good i think the movie may have been a little more moving if they did actually die or just leave them going up the elevator nicks and simons relationship was very well done and simons relationships with just about anyone were pretty well rounded that are not that many times that i mention the special features but i must say that i loved the plot holes part it was very funny and it added to the whole attitude that the movie makers took to this movie this zombie movie succeeds where a lot of other films failed but putting real people in a silly situation and making them real,black_comedy
and it is excellent is very unique is darkly hilarious is just a necessary movie experience when the film came out i didnt go thinking it would be a witty chuckle every ten minutes wallace and gromit kind of thing not the case is certainly witty but it is more a laugh really hard every 5 seconds kind of thing the timing in the film is just incredible every joke pantomime and action is just executed so masterfullyis described as a romantic comedy with zombiessounds like a bad idea i was wrong 1010,black_comedy
i wasnt expecting much seeing as im not a big fan of zombie movies apart from night of the living dead 1968 version but i was pleasantly surprised basically simon pegg plays loser shaun who lives with his flatmate ed and has been dumped by his girlfriend a plague of zombies are attacking the town so he decides to hide in the pub with several near friends this film has a star studded cast well in my opinion with the likes of matt lucas little britain bill nighy  guest house paradiso pirates of the caribbean 2 and dylan moran black books this movie was funny and slightly frightening as well and had a bit of gore to satisfy the hardcore romero fans so if youre a fan of zombie films or just a fan of simon pegg then watch this film you wont regret it,black_comedy
as a living dead fan of 20 years i tend to not care for films that spoof my beloved genre however shaun is not a spoof in the sense of the word shaun is basically an intelligent horror comedy film based in reality all zombie films are fantasy based but 9 times out of 10 the settings or characters seem a little unrealistic or focuses on an expertly trained group of soldiers shaun does non of this and is probably the first zombie film since the original night of the living dead to bring back the every day man and his struggles during the start of a zombie outbreakwhat separates shaun from the other dead films is the script sharp humor interjected into everyday living situations and everyday living situations played out during a zombie apocalypse make for fantastically funny moments and great entertainment plus you have edgar wrights own social commentary in how we as a living breathing human race arent far off from our undead brethren in how we execute our daily routine this makes for some of the most fabulous story telling in film periodpays homage to all of george a romeros zombie films and even spoofs some of his most famous death scenes from his 1985 film day of the dead simon pegg and nick frost play off each other perfectly and the remaining supporting cast fit well and sell the story with easeis one of the funniest british comedies to come out in the last few years and will rank up there with such classics from guys like monty python and company this film is a must have for any dvd collection,black_comedy
is probably one of the best zombie movies ever made dawn of the dead was very gory but not at all funny whereas slither was just silly and not that funny  but has everything it is gory and very witty  a real cult classic people will enjoy watching thick ed troubled shaun and all the other characters in their crazy scenarios that take them across london but is also quite a realistic and troubling depiction of an apocalyptic world  made even more realistic by the fact that it builds up fear and chaos as it continues and starts on generally quite a small scale chronicling the happenings at shaun and eds house rather than throwing us straight into the action right at the start like on dawn of the dead the first 25 minutes are mainly concentrated on shauns social life  but hints are dropped on the zombie plague as the film continues and despite the fact that wouldnt be if it wasnt for the zombies the film is really about shauns life and how quickly your life can change in one day instead of zombies getting blasted with shotguns and escaped from with cars follows the adventures of shauns ragtag group through the streets  in a way that probably would happen if something like this were ever to happen shaun and his friends didnt have guns or huge malls to defend them  they only had each other their brains and cunning plans the bit where they all pretended to be zombies to get through a zombie crowd was genius and a plan that could be used in real life though the end is somewhat very actionpacked is generally a very gritty and shocking film made on a small scale to capture the essence of real suburban life and the emotions and feelings of a couple of people trying to live through something they did not understand or could escape from what ive been trying to say is  if a zombie plague were to happen in real life would be the closest thing to a proper survival guide you could get your hands on ive spent most of my comment trying to be serious about this film when it is actually lighthearted but i personally believe this is what every horrorcomedy or comedy in general film should aspire to with a packedwithextras dvd release complete with an interesting trivia track commentaries and tons more stuff is definitely one to get if you see it cheap spiffing 1010,black_comedy
this is the best romantic comedy zombie film rom com zom youll ever see and possibly the only you will see so watch and enjoy now before it becomes a cult classic and trust me it will stuck with a deadend job having no motivation in life and living with a sluggish flatmate who only plays video games or drags him to the pub shaun simon pegg is your typical underachiever in fact his lazy attitude and inability to break this pattern drives his girlfriend liz kate ashfield to break up with him leaving him in an ever deeper rut than before shaun is so depressed with his situation that he does not even notice the ongoing zombie invasion that turns recentlydiseased people into the living flesheating dead it is not until the zombies literally show up at his doorstop and try to eat him and his flatmate alive that they pick up on that something is wrong priceless is the most random and simultaneously brilliant parody i have ever seen sure there have been many wellcrafted spoofs over the years young frankenstein airplane army of darkness etc but where most films concentrate on parodying one genre this film takes care of spoofing all genreshorror comedy romance and it does to in a genius way for example when shaun and the rest seek refuge from the zombies at the local pub barricading themselves in it turns into a pastiche of from dusk till dawn down to the very weapons they use positions they stand in and the zombie attacks they suffer then you have the prototype of an antihero shaun who turns into a stallonelike tough guy during a short period of time in the pub wearing a sweaty bandanna across his forehead and holding a rifle in his hand generally looking like the most badass character in action films just the way the dialogue cuts to an action deserves a great deal of credit as it is perfectly handled another thing i often find myself getting annoyed at the reactions of the characters in horror films when they are faced with danger  they either dont look scared enough or they screw up their reaction in other ways  but in this is perfection i dont expect i need to comment on the blatant allegory for the zombie generation of our time and the way people in big cities in london are not entirely different from zombies a part of the reason why shaun and his friends take time to realise something is wrong910,black_comedy
i was looking through the comments ive posted on imdb and found that most of them were pointing out the really bad movies i wondered why i think its because id like to warn people who might not know otherwise but its about time i made the list of my comments more lopsided towards good movies and what could be more deserving than i cant even get past how great the title is teeheehee it tickles so this movie is brilliant beautiful hilarious and all those other great words we saw it in the theatre still surprised it came to our dinky town and i didnt want to leave i wanted to hide under the stinky sticky dirty seat thinking about how great this movie was until the next showing if you like a bit of campy gore great british humor curse words and queen please watch this movie,black_comedy
its like this bloke yeah bit of a geezer always down the pub doing his pint having his fags you know doing his thing and his bird right whatapuppet wants things like this like that this that the other that kinda bird you know anyway this bloke always down the pub goes with his bird has a few pints a few fags some nuts has a top night following day zombies take over a few people die anyway they end up back at the boozer right have a few pints few fags few nuts few laughs top night and basically its a proper film like i recommend you to watch itoh more details about the film ok right theres loads of zombies right and loads of beer pints smokes the lot its top you cant go wrong with a film like this really you cantanyway this bloke has got a mate and hes really funny like always letting them rip and just well you know mucking about its allround family fun,black_comedy
i watched this movie and loved it it was absolutely hilarious at some parts and was very interesting i couldnt stop talking about this movie after i watched it if youre looking for a thriller but funny and stupid movie borrow its excellent there is a lot of blood and gore in this movie as well i think it was a good idea to make a funny and stupid impersonation of dawn of the dead and they sure did it well i rated this movie 910 because it was the best horror comedy movie i have ever seen the characters were well created especially the character of shaun and the movie couldnt have been better written,black_comedy
i really didnt want to hype myself up at how good this film might be before i watched it because whenever i have done so in the past theyve all turned out to be dire but this film was brilliant no two ways about it the simple reason behind its success in knowledge from the comedy stable of pegg and wright of s p a c e d fame these two have always made it clear that they have a passion for classic zombie films so getting the chance to create their own must have seemed like music to their ears the result is a classic  simple plot in as far as the zombies and their disposal but also a deep soup into which the viewer can wade about in the film plays like a wheres wally of extra stuff some of which you dont realise until to hear the commentary  it really is a top filum and all because the writers had the knowledge and the passion for what they were making cracking stuff,black_comedy
now this film is something else from when i first watched when it was released on dvd i believe it to be the best british comedy with it communicating ideas of love and relationships strongly throughout it i cant understand why someone wouldnt enjoy this film its great fun from start to finish and really easy to watch its the kinda film u watch on a sunday lead on your sofa rough the narrative is really easy to follow but is still effective mt favourite part of this film is when ed has to pretend to be a zombie absolutely hilarious the only way someone can dis this film is if they arent british because its humour is very britishit also rips dawn of the dead and other zombie films to pieces and makes us all realise how much of geeks people are who are into these kinda films if you ask me is spot on and is must watch for everyone,black_comedy
as a college student that loves film i enjoy all types of movies my roommate and i especially enjoy the zombie genre because of its utter predictability its lack of fresh ideas and its unintentional comedic qualities there is nothing that i enjoy more on a rainy day then turning on a zombie movie and laughing and joking throughout the entire filmwhen i saw the preview for i thought finally a movie that will make fun of zombie movies so i wont have to boy did it meet my expectations this movie is the best zombie movie in years maybe even ever because it exploits the ridiculousness of the make up of the moviescast of stock characters for z movies the main character smart leader and always survives main characters love interested agreeable attempts to rally the group to follow the mc idiot disagrees makes dumb decisions and always gets the group in trouble always gets it in the end all the characters are there but this movie adds one element to give a shock treatment to the world of zombie movies ed what a great character comic relief although the movie is already hysterical best friend of the main character and a complete new character for this type of movie his completely lack of brain mass leads to the funniest scenes in the movie a character that stays completely the same throughout the entire movie never wavering even with the entire city turned into the living deadthis movie is littered with british comedy mixed with one liners that will make you laugh even after seeing the movie 100 timesthis movie came out right during the peek of horrible new and remade zombie movies 28 days dawn of the dead day of the dead 2 contagium and some other dead movies that i have blocked out of my mind this film is the best by far and i would recommend it to anyone who has sometime and wants to laugh finally a zombie movie you dont have to talk through to have fun watching it,black_comedy
this movie is totally great and it is fun from the beginning until the endthis is a parody to horror moviesmy favorite genre and it is totally funnythe scene in which the zombies kill david is hilariousedgar wright made an excellent film and i am very interested in watching more films from himin the second half of the movie there is a great scene in which they are fighting with a zombie and you hear the queen song do not stop me nowthe genre of the movie is a romantic comedy with zombiesthat description sounds strangebut when you see the movie you know that it is the best description of the moviei recommend this hilarious movie to fans of horror films,black_comedy
before i had just about given up hope for the zombiethemed horror film apparently just about every movie made today containing at least one shambling undead creature must be either tedious or so gruesomely violent as to make professional serial killers lose their lunch shaun changed my mind in a hurrythe movie itself is about two losers shaun and ed who must fight against hordes of living corpses in order to save shauns exgirlfriend his mum and the pub that forms the center of their lives just about everything about this variant of the normal zombie horror flick blew my mind for example 1 instead of taking place somewhere in the us the audience sees their heroes running around london for a decent change 2 very little gore and gunplay just some blood spurting around and multiple blunt objects being used to their full potential 3 no more heroic stars no brave cops or security guards to force their way through the zombie hordes here the action is focused around a white collar bum and his lazy stoner friend this stand against the zombie norm is one of the reasons why i enjoy this film so much the other major reason being its just freakin funnyif you love comedies and youre tired of the same old zombies ripping the same old heads off the same old movie stereotypes go for bring a cricket bat,black_comedy
i watched it again last night it must be one of the funniest films ever made the partnership between simon pegg and nick frost is great and really helped nick frost with his career i was also great to see all the famous faces pop up even if it was for a few brief seconds dylan moran brought back his style of acting which he had mastered down to a tee quite similar to his black books character to be honest a congratulations must go to the casting director as all who were in it were excellent and also congratulations to them for choosing kate ashfield and lucy davis because not only are they funny and great actors but they are also hot congratulations again and may more movies follow,black_comedy
this film is absolute hilarious and a must see some classic quotes and probably the greatest film of its genre simon peggi plays the best character and with his witty sidekick nick frost they create one of the great partnerships of the modern age this film is funny from start to finish with great acting throughout with actors from black books and danger 50000 volts everybody should see this movie for the purpose of living lol no seriously this film is an absolute classic and a ten out of ten easythe dvd is awesome as well,black_comedy
if you like the simpsons or spaced and enjoy that style of humour you will bloody love this it is slow at start but once you watch it for a second time you will love iti have watched it 22 timesthe whole film and i love it nick frost is a brilliant actor and plays ed perfectly brilliant directing fom edgar wright and superb acting from simon peggwho is my favourite actor ever who i met in london at forbidden planet on the 151105 he was really cool and signed my copy of the comic book the film is definitely a black comedy since there is lots of gore at the end and also shauns mum dies there is a brilliant shootout between shaun and the zombies at the endbuy it on dvdits packed full of special features youll become obsessed with it like i didmy name is sean,black_comedy
of all of the trying to be funny pseudohorror movies ive seen this ones the bestby far the subtle humor found throughout the whole movie just kills me haget it kills mesorry the fact that the creators could do so much building around just the little bits of horror continuity like the slothlike speed of the zombies really cracks me up and what was much funnier than when shaun and the gang were on their way to the winchester and ran into his gal friend  all of her friendsthat happened to be carbon copies of them not much if youre looking for a movie with laughs touching moments and even a little bit of sexiness petes naked in the shower definitely watch this one you will not regret it,black_comedy
sometimes a man just needs a little bit of motivation to fix the problems of life and what better motivation than a bunch of zombies shaun simon pegg is a guy who has just been dump by his girlfriend liz kate ashfield because of his lack of ambitions stuck in a dead end job and in a constant fight with his step father shaun can only rely on his good old friend ed nick frost and the old pub they frequent the winchester when zombies appear and begin to wreak havoc shaun decides this may be the chance to prove liz that he can be a man and goes on a quest to rescue her and take her to the winchesterthats basically the plot of edgar wrights brilliant romanticzombie comedy straight from the great sitcom spaced wright  pegg have written what could be the best comedy of the year and one of the funniest movies of all time is basically a romantic comedy happening in the middle of romeros dawn of the dead with all the clichs of both genres but included in very intelligent and funny wayssimon pegg shines in his character as shaun with a performance so good that makes the character truly believable as a loser who must grow and get things done nick frost as ed is the perfect companion to pegg and their chemistry is quite great shaun and ed probably will go down in history as one of the best comedy team in moviesthe supporting characters are awesome too and nobody gives a bad performance brilliant is the work of lucy davis and dylan moran as liz best friends and while kate ashfield is probably the weakest link her performance is still up to the challengethe makeup and sfx essential in a zombie movie are topnotch and the care taken by director wright show his truly respect for the genre he is making fun of in his movie the film delivers its good share of gore and blood and is also filled with references to classic movies of the genre horror fans will be pleased withoverall is now a modern classic joining classics such as brainead and return of the living dead as films that set the standards for comedyhorror 910 classic,black_comedy
i am not a fan of zombie movies to say the least therefore i was pleasantly surprised and somewhat thrilled when i saw this for the first timewhat can i say but what a show i laughed from start to finish simon pegg is a very talented writer and comic actor he is in my opinion the british woody allen i was not familiar with him and edgar wrights previous working relationship but this is a classic example of a actor and director being on the same wavelenght and working not for the money but for their sheer love of film makingpegg plays shaun whose live is bookended by his best mate ed nick frost and his local pub the winchester he is dumped by his girl friend on the eve of an apocalypse he decides overnight that his girlfriend is the girl from him and he must get his life back on tracks with the aid of ed he must rescue his girlfriend her friends and his mother from certain extinction is well acted written and directed its supporting cast is fantastic nick frost is brilliant as ed but in my own opinion its the performance by dylan moran that really shine through as the cowardly david kate ashfield plays peggs girlfriend although she comes across as quite annoying i will admit this girl has talent the cast also boasts the best in british comedy ranging from matt lucas reece shearsmith tamzin grieg and many othershas got something for every one and it will not disappoint horror fans already a cult success partnership i look forward to peggs  wrights further collaborations especially if they are as clever and funny as this,black_comedy
this is what i call a film i havent laughed as much as the first time i watched monty python and the holy grail simon pegg has said that this film wasnt a spoof it was a romantic comedy with zombieswhich probably make this film funnier because if it was a spoof some parts would have been milked to the limitshaun simon pegg is a bum who spends his life down his loyal pub the winchester with his best mate ed nick frost who is a fat lazy slob his girlfriend liz kate ashfield decides to break up with shaun but suddenly the dead are coming back to life and shaun must save liz and his mam from the undeadthis film is so well written i love ed he is a fat slob who we all know and hate even when zombies are surrounding him he answers his phone and starts talking to a matehighly recommended film  ,black_comedy
is a must see film its hilarious shaun and ed his fat friend are very well played the storyadventure is brilliant and it is never boring i saw dawn of the dead earlier and thought that is was very very good after seeing that i thought that i wouldnt like would be not so good i mean i didnt want to see dawn of the dead with comedy eventually i hired from the video store not expecting a hell of a lot but i was dead wrong it began hilarious and didnt stop it was very violent and very entertaining the characters were very cool and it seemed as their adventure would never endwhat the audience enjoys is when it seems that there is noway out of the disaster that has occurred there is happy ending with blood splattering every where i conclusion sean of the dead is a must see movie that is never ever boring throughout the whole movie,black_comedy
is clearly one of the best movies period if you have not seen this movie your missing out on some really funny stuff and the gore is just great throughout the movie this movie will also get you into every zombie movie ever created and i will admit when i first saw the trailer for i thought that it was going to just another typical b rated movie but when i finally got around to watching the movie i realized i couldnt have been more wrong its a movie that its just straight perfect its a must in any persons dvd collection and you will watch it over and over because this is just one of those movies that never get tiring to see thats my story and im stickin to it humor and horror at it peak,black_comedy
all shaun wants to do is live a nice peaceful normal life with his girlfriend and best friend however when a mysterious infection spreads throughout england its up to him to bring his family and friends to a local pub and wait for the whole incident to blow over but it may prove harder to him than it seems when the infection turns out to be causing the dead to return to life his only weapon a paddle shaun sets out to save his loved ones and unfortunately manages to save two people besides himself oh well not everyone gets to be a hero its an excellent spin off of dawn of the dead and the guy who plays as shaun also appears in land of the dead great movie,black_comedy
ok this movie had in my country one of the worst promotions i have ever seen even they changed the great title from to zombies party impossible to explain this shows that great horror movies like this one have a bad promotion because of the thematic looks like the premise of romzomcom wasnt interesting enough for my country but sadly i cant change thatabout the movie i have to say that i have never laugh so much with a horror movie like with this one the duo of edward wright and simon pegg is genius their screenplay has nothing to envy the ones written by george romero and the powerful comedy is not an excuse to show us really gruesome zombie gore momentsthere is no political background here here is social background a guy passing through the crisis of his upcoming 30s he has to move on to survive so he has to keep living without friends without his mom without his stepdad bill nighy such a joy and to fix things with his girlfriendas the tag line says this is a romantic comedy with zombies and you cant dig much more in that basic plot which makes it delightfully simple,black_comedy
i have seen this film several times now and i its hard to get sick of it it is witty funny and not at all corny or ridiculous its sharp when it should be sharp its sad when its supposed to be sad but its still funny where it counts its just brilliant directing and acting i love it my friend even was so kind as to introduce me to the tv series spaced by the same team and director which is just as good i recommend this to everyone  except those who hate gore  its funny but there is a bit of that in it it doesnt lag at all the whole way through you are being entertained by something else one of the best things about this film though  is that it works on so many levels every time you watch it you pick more up there are little clues and cool references to zombie movies and other films its worth the watchwatch it if you love idle hands,black_comedy
this movie wasnt hugely hyped or even advertised a great deal the only reason i went to see in in the cinema was because i had a little money and a few hours to kill and for a movie that i hadnt really looked forward to i think it was absolutely superb it manages to do everything from making you laugh to making you jump to making you think aaawbut thankfully not too much during the first viewing i was taken by its britishness itwasnt very often that a movies main action can take place in a pub it was only during the second viewing that i saw that the script was actually very well thought out and clever what impressed me was the fact that the zombies look incredibly convincing and the action scenes are genuinely exciting which is made even more impressive by the films budget i would recommend this film to anyone regardless of personal tastes theres something for everyone be it comedy action even a few snatches of romance i think its brilliant and im proud to have it in my collection,black_comedy
first came abbot and costello meetthen came young frankensteinthen american werewolf in londonreturn of the living dead and nowshaunthe history of horror comedy if filled with gems and this takes the cake not only is it consistently funny gory and filled with romeroesque social satire it far out does any of the mass market slapstick will ferrelljack black comedy and the endless output of predictable copycat horror that american studios keep shoving down the publics throat digs at everything from the zombie genre to the zombielike existence of the general shuffling public shaun may be a loser in some sense but when you really look at the film most men will find that at some point in their lives the could be the character in fact shaun is the epitome of the twentysomething working class male of the 21 century come on how many of us would not like to be ably to hang at the pub down pints with our long time pals and play video games all day dont forget the hot girlfriend and the drama that comes with that throw in the opportunity to bash the skulls of some zombies and play the hero of the day and youve got the perfect existence rightthats basically what you get when shaun rises from his couch to take on life shaun and the assembly line existence of the service industry level emplotment that forms the majority of the working class are already zombies they just dont see it as illustrated by shauns daily routine at the beginning of the film what differentiates shaun from the rest is the dormant motivation he possesses to change that which consumes the restthe zombies are a great allegory for the challenges of growing up maturing and the demons we all must overcome in order to salvage our lives from the mundane you either sit back make no moves and become a zombie or you fight back and make the changes in order to succeed and rise to the top of the pack shauns struggles are no different than our own and it is fun to watch from the safety of the theatre or your own couch with the dvd playing in your playstation as the zombies attack what makes this clever romzomcom different from the films in the comedy and horror genres of recent years is that the setting is not a fantastic world or an upperclass suburban white neighborhood filled with movie star beauty it is a real place that exists in every city populated with realistic people making it easy for the average person to relate to the humor is sharp and intelligent instead of being in you face vulgar and mindless there is not attempt to capitalize on the trends of mainstream comedy to rake in the bucks the horror is not reliant on expensive yet obvious cgi effects or recycled masked killers that are as outdated as 80s style high bangs and leg warmers this movie goes straight to the gut whether for laughs or repulsion it is worthy of the films it parodies and makes fun of you will have fun picking out the minor characters from the beginning of the film after they have become zombies notice that other than the craving for human flesh the undead versions of the individuals is not much different than their prezombie lives is a gem that will hopefully make american studios take notice of and explore,black_comedy
after stumbling upon this film on hbo one night at home i have become an instant simon pegg fanatic his and edgard wrights brilliantly creative and comedic styles really stand out in every aspect of its very rare for me to discuss this picture without gushing about its genius this is a film that can be watched over and over again and each time youll notice a new subtle yet stunningly clever detail that you missed the last time the swift pace is consistent throughout the entire film and theres never a dull momentthe delightfully engaging cast of characters is brilliantly portrayed by an assemblage of marvelously talented young actors along with veterans bill nighy and penelope wilton who plays shauns adorable mum barbaraone of my favorite characteristics of the film is the parallelism between the first segment of the film leading up to the zombie invasion and the second segment during the crisis itself its difficult to explain without revealing too much about the film so watch it first and see if you can point it out on your own the idiosyncrasy that sets this apart from any other picture ive seen is that while the comedy aspect of it really is hysterical the zombies themselves stay true to the horror genreis destined to become a cult hit and i look forward to enjoying future works from simon pegg and edgar wright,black_comedy
spoilers big ones i was definitely not the target audience for this movie in any way im not from england im not a man and particularly not one with girlfriend problems and i dont like horror movies generally so all of the little homages to those sailed right over my head like a dire straits album flung by a desperate slacker not only that since the us only gets britcoms in small doses i had no idea who simon pegg was the only cast members id heard of were bill nighy of kiss me kate and peter serafinowicz whom i knew only as the sexy voice of megasexy darth maulso i shouldnt have liked this movie at all but i really did bill nighys turn as the stepfather who ironically becomes most human just as hes about to turn into a zombie is magnificent as is the muchdiscussed bit where debbie instructs the little group in how to act like zombies to escape detection  a moment that reminded me pleasantly of buffy the vampire slayer and her scooby gang much has been said about the films social commentary which includes the annoying  and at the door of the winchester potentially lethal  ubiquity of cell phones but beyond that the movie works by not taking itself too seriously yet at the same time showing real heart  mostly in brief flashes like the deaths of philip and barbara but most so at the end it takes a truly devoted friend to keep his zombified bitey best mate tied up with a playstation in his shed which liz apparently doesnt mind even though she couldnt stand ed as a humanyes it drags in places davids crush on liz is so obvious that it really doesnt need explication at such length in the pub for example and our hero and heroine are saved not by their own actions but by a massive deus ex machina but the movies humor of the ordinary barbara seeing shauns cricket bat is that for the jumble makes a lovely background for the surreal events that unfoldthanks to seeing this movie randomly on cable ill now be looking up spaced probably black book and other series that contributed cast members will i seek out the original romero movies or other horror movies given nods here probably not davids death was much more gory  and drawn out  than even his whiny character deserved and was about as much gore as i really needed to see but i enjoyed even when i clearly shouldnt have and im glad to have stumbled zombiefashion across it,black_comedy
let me start by saying that this film is a british one and that unbritish people might not appreciate the humour so much but thats not to say you wont get it necessarily this film is awesomely funny it has just the right balance of humour satire and gore that it doesnt get cheesy and clich and it could quite easily have done sothe only criticism i have is that towards the end it loses pace slightly and i think it left a few unanswered questions which happily are covered in the extras on the dvdyou might need to be into zombie films to appreciate the gore or failing that not mind seeing the odd limb being severed etc probably not a film for your grandma theni am giving this film 810 its in my collection and i hope to see more films from simon pegg in the future,black_comedy
2004 3 and 14 stars areviews out of 4 british comedy about a guy with problems with his girlfriend lives with his lazy sloppy friend who his roommate keeps trying to kick out plus and it seems to be the least of his problems until about halfway theres a zombie epidemic its so funny to watch this movie and see the irony of all the lines before the zombies really start to be a problem next time i see him hes dead or what i will say is this its not the end of the world and also the fact that everything and i mean everything in the movie repeats itself at the start shaun is watching ed play 1st person shooter on ps2 and says top left reload nice shot and then in middle in winchester shaun is shooting a rifle ed says top left reload nice shot shaun is talking to liz about their r relationship and she says if i dont do something shaun says what do you mean do something then in front of winchester with zombies all around shaun says if i dont do something liz says what do you mean do something would you like to a wonderful mum or pow supermum uh the first one you want the girl or the bloat uh the first one its just really cool to see all that and each time you watch it you notice something more also it has plenty of references to romero movies were coming to get you barbera along with all the jokes and funny situations and adding some intense violence couldnt hurt either its just a great movie all around and i would recommend it to anyone who pays really close attention to the dialog and the radios in the background or tvs because thats where most of the jokes are and otherwise you wont find it very funny best part the part when shaun tries to take a shortcut over the 20 garden fences,black_comedy
was in mostly every way perfect it was hilarious it was creepy at times frightening and the jokes never got old shaun simon pegg is a 29yearold electronic store manager who must deal most nights with a problem spending a good night with his girlfriend liz kate ashfield without having his best friend and flatmate nick frost in an awesome role there all the time the result is they are always having a night at the local pub the winchester ed loves it there liz hates it and shaun is stuck in the middle this sets up a roller coaster ride of insanely funny accurances as well as some minor scary jump scenes the performances in general are good especially pegg who is always on the spot with his great comedic abilities the writing is well crafted and the director is well done yeah boyy 1010,black_comedy
the best film of 2004 10 out of 10 mixes black comedy elements with zombie horror creating a captivating movie that surprises you with its twist and perfectly elaborated details from the beginning portraying goofy shaun and lazy ed to the unexpected end you laugh yourself to death the antihero characteristics of shaun and ed give the movie an unique but brilliant touch adding things from well known movies gives movie experts moments of silent joyfor example the red handkerchief worn by shaun around the head in the pub after he is hit by a dart was worn by christopher walken in the russian roulette scenes in the deer hunter despite having the characteristics of an indie movie has surprisingly good special effects and is cinematographically top a great movie,black_comedy
shaun is an everyday slob who when we first meet him is having a serious discussion with his girlfriend about their relationship among her two friends and his drunk oaf of a pal as this film progresses shaun realizes his downfall with her and must get her backafter the zombies get there of course what a perfect idea for a horror movie this is british comedy at its finest the beginning of the movie is shauns humdrum existence living with three friends and working at a dead end job trying to get along with his step dad then as his day progresses there are subtle hints that some kind of illness is going around something deadly indeed in fact when shaun and his pal ed first see one of the infected they just think shes drunk and then impale her and thats when the horror movie begins and yet its still so funny this movie will be forever known as the funniest zombie movie ever made unless of course you prefer dead alive which i do not it makes me think of coronation street every time i watch it that is a messed up halloween edition i think no one could have pulled off this movie better than the brits if americans had their way with this shaun would be an advertising exec with a model girlfriend and a hunk best pal who encounter zombies but in a mainstream commercial way which i think wouldnt work in fact i dont americans could ever top this kind of film in general but thats another topic all in all this movie will rock your boat and then some,black_comedy
is a comedy more than a horror the name indicates a spoof and it shows a few references to some wellknown horror films while most of the scenes are bellylaugh funny the scenes that arent funny balance out the fact that there is at least some seriousness that should be taken note ofit is a very well done film from choreography to jokes timing was just right i give it 9 out of 10 as when i wasnt laughing i was smiling and when i wasnt smiling my next laugh wasnt far awayits a british film so fans of british comedy would enjoy this more than those that enjoy the american sitcom type of humour the scenes were as pleasing to the eye as the jokes were to the earsimply amazing a film i would recommend and buy once it is on dvd ive seen it twice already and it was just as funny the second time its one of those movies worth seeing more than once,black_comedy
is a unique zombie movie its unique because its also romantic its unique because it mixes british humor with american horror its unique because its a romantic comedywith zombiestells a story about two slackers ed and shaun shaun is a 50 loser 50 nice guy he loves his work as a manager of an electronics store he loves playing timesplitters future perfect with his buddy ed and also loves hanging out at the winchester with him but he gets overstressed by his flatmate pete his girlfriend liz and also lizs friend david he is also sad because he was chosen with two options his girlfriend or the pub he hangs out withed on the other hand is a pure loser he is fat he has no job and he kept playing timesplitters future perfect for 6 hours a day he makes shaun looks stupid but shaun didnt realized this till the middle of the movie he has a good social intelligence due to the fact that he knows most people hanging out at the pub snakehips the womanizer the exporn star and john the barman he is easily hated by his 2nd flatmate peteshaun has a girlfriend named liz shes a primary school teacher and both of them met in greece she lives with david a lecturer and diana a drama school teacher she gets tired of shaun hanging out with ed so she wants shaun to go somewhere interesting than the winchester so shaun promised but like other promises this ones a failed promiseso she dumped shaun causing shaun to hang out with ed at the winchester againthe next day zombies attacked london shaun doesnt realized until a zombie girl appeared in the garden worrying that his other loved ones may suffer the same thing shaun and ed came to rescue liz shaun mother barbara diana and david who thinks that he is more smarter than shaun and the rest of the crew and so they headed for somewhere safe somewhere ed says know where the exits are somewhere familiar and he can smoke and the only place to have it all is the winchesternow lets get on to the other characters diana is a good friend of liz who is also supportive of shaun even when she supports david more david on the other hand is not supportive of shaun in all sorts and thinks that he is smarter than shaun and this has a very open debate between the book smartsdavid and the street smartsshaun peter is shauns flatmate he hates ed and keeps accusing shaun of defending ed he ends up becoming a naked bathtub zombie philip is shauns grumpy step dad and has always been unkind to shaun with his gothic accent and his suspicious behavior barbara is shauns sweet mum and despite of shauns hatred towards philip barbara still loves philip even when becoming a zombiewhat differs this movie from other zombie films that it is not about the zombies nor the amount of violence unlike romeros living dead and raimis evil dead series but its more about survival and background its tells you more about what are you going to do when something like this happens the background is also important just like juon the surrounding of the whole area is whats more important when shaun was drinking tea with his mum you can hear the car ed was driving crashing to the post and when shaun and ed were drinking at the winchester the day shaun broke up with liz you can see the zombie walking to the bar door its all that matters you can even see more of it if you watch itthe whole script was good it has a good humor and the best ever and also has some reference from zombie films to several 80s hiphop music simon pegg delivers the best in zombie comedy since peter jacksons braindead and edgar wrights direction gave us the best in highquality filmmaking if youre a fan of horror who hate romance then this movies for you if youre a fan of romance who hates horror then this movies for you too if youre a fan of both then of course this movies for you what else im gonna say rating 1010,black_comedy
is a truly unique film in the aspect that is seamlessly combines zombie horror with a romantic comedy what i expected was a funny but shallow zombiecomedy flick but underneath the blood and humor it really is a heartfelt moviethe movie begins like you would expect it to it was hilarious with lots of subtle hints of what would happen later the actors are all fantastic and each one of them is hilarious in their own way the script is sharp and witty although a lot of that british humor might have gone way over my head and the direction was spoton what i didnt expect though came toward the end near the conclusion the film actually gets pretty heavy from such themes as keeping those you love alive but keeping everyone safe and being in complete desperation make this a surprisingly intense movie i also really really liked the use of queens dont stop me now and the references to night of the living dead its also fun to look out for zombified people who were normal in the beginningoverall is a great horrorcomedy film that is a total blast any fan of zombie horror or british comedy is surely going to love it,black_comedy
hands down this is one of the funniest movies ive ever seen from the part where shaun and ed throw records at the zombies in the back yard to the part where shaun and ed plan out their mothers rescue and step fathers demise this movie is sheer brilliance the movie starts off where shaun and liz are discussing each others friends and how they just dont like them a day or so later on their anniversary shaun and liz break up another day later and the town is infested with zombies shaun overall is just having a bad day and in addition to that is oblivious to the fact that the town is infested with zombies as the movie goes on we cant help but realize how a craving for beer and love can over take the fact that theres a group of zombies outside waiting to eat shaun and ed id overall recommend this to british humor fans zombie fans horrorcomedy fans or people who are just in the mood for a good romantic comedy with zombies this is a must see,black_comedy
is a decent movie with some comedy and horror elements but personally i feel that this film is pretty overrated the story is about shaun a likable loser whos girlfriend just dumped him ed is his slovenly partnerincrime and when the town becomes overrun by zombies shaun scoops up his girlfriend liz and they all head to the bar  to holeup and defend themselvesdefinitely some good humorous scenes but very lacking in the gore department after all the hype this film received i have to honestly say i was kinda disappointed a pretty fun and funny horrorcomedy but ill stick with peter jacksons far superior braindead anyone who has seen shaun but not braindead should definitely check the latter out far more hilarious and tons more gore a generous 710 for shaun,black_comedy
whoever guy that made this moviehe must be one of the most geniusbrilliant and smart director on earthhe successfully made it this comedy movie as the most unforgettablethe most grateful and the most funniest ever madei love itand i bet everybody love it toocauseit was the smartest comedy which it would make you laugh until diegreat castingsmart plot and dialogsstunning british jokesi cant believe there was a comedy like thisthis movie deserve nominations for all the award eventsonce againi love itim just want to saywatch ityoull never regretand watch outmaybe there are zombies will company beside you,black_comedy
when i saw this movie advertisedi knew it would be good as simon pegg hardly ever goes wrong fortunatly i was dead right pegg has created a spacedesqe zombie flick dripping with references to other parts from other films dont think this is unoriginal though this has to be one of the funniest zombie films around for a good while whilst the plot has the backbone of all the rest of the zombie filmslead is unexpectedly made hero as zombies flood the cityits knowing references and jokes at the genresimon peggs character is unwilling to say the word zombiegar fansmake sure the viewer laughs the whole way through and at the end will want to watch it again there are no weakness to this film and if anyone says soits just because they want to complain about it seek out the dvd and it will be money well spent,black_comedy
i had to say it took me twice to realize i liked this movie i would have to say my fav part would be when david is taken out the window and the zombies begin ripping out his insides while hes still alive imust say that had to be the most amusing part of the movie just when the guy stops being a jerk hes killed why dont they do this in all of the horror moviesoh hes not so bad ouchantagonist is killed hum oh well whatever he would have reverted back to being a insert censored word here anywayi voted on a 10 because queen was involved death zombies british humor need i say more and of course everyone dies but the two who are in love well not because of that but the rest of it rocks,black_comedy
this is a zombie genre tribute that manages to balance satire and some scary not those many actually moments the horrorcomedy follows from beginning to end the title character through his anonymous life in london and could be either a romantic story or a horror flick disguised as something making laugh edgar wright all the sad and frequent compromises adults must cope with symbolizing them by blending a killer soundtrack suspense and the classical zombie clichs plus he gives a look at british life telling how monotonous life may be sometimes we are many times surrounded by zombies without even realizing it,black_comedy
very very good film i saw it only yesterday evening before bed and i can guaranty that i went to sleep in a very good mood it is a very good horror comedy and i recommend all to see it you wont regret in this film you can see everything  romance horror comedy and a little bit of drama finally there is something that is not typical hollywood film english version about zombies is acceptable and definitely will watch it again today to show this film to my friends at the beginning it is little boring but then it so good that i couldnt stop laughing about these stupid zombies and zombie killers very many good scenes at the end of the film when they are already in the bar well i cant tell all details you must watch it on your own cool,black_comedy
this is a pretty good film for a lighthearted romp with splattering brains reallyprobably the best mix of comedy and gore out there theres enough character development to get behind the trials and travails of shaun and his gang the script and direction are good and shauns buddy ed is a cut up  and does some cutting up shauns gal has a great butt the british twist on the humor and embedded commentary on society give the film more punch we americans are finally are shown the proper use of a cricket batthe most amazing thing for me is how far reaching romeros little bw zombie film has become,black_comedy
this film is brilliant sorry but it is i went round a mates to see it an i just wanted to watch it again and again that was about 10 months ago an ive got it on dvd and i must watch it a lot why this film is really clever it somehow manages to mix romance and horror an sadness an happiness andzombies together in one 2 hour session of fun its clever because all the tag lines are impeccably timed throughout the film ed gets the best lines not just because theyre really funny anyway but because of when he says them eg in the pub  could get a round  when they are really scared i think the character of shaun is really well done and simon pegg pulls of a performance which is what a lot of nearly 30s are in girlfriend in a mood losing money bad job his character is believable because lots of us know people in the same situation as himthe camera work in this is good as well quick shots an panning round rooms and look behind you shots are all good and can make you jump sometimes tothe actors are all great in this the person who cast them in this film should be knighted or something my verdict fried gold,black_comedy
is an interesting creature a movie as clever as its title the best part of this stylishly filmed movie is its sly first half hour in which the film makers taunt the audience with a series of goofy takeoffs on standard zombie film making the movie takes its time to get to the zombies starting by involving you in the lives of the characters but while this was the flaw in the birds and jurasic park it works great here because the nonzombie scenes are lots of funthe movie slides from relationshipbuddy comedy to horror movie as it goes along its a nicely done slide that takes you deeper into the more suspenseful part of the movie without being jarring and it never loses its sense of humor but one scene was way too gory for me if one scene were toned down i would probably give this an 8 and the attempts at drama tended to be flat but while i wouldnt call it a perfect movie it was a movie of perfect moments and well worth watching if you can deal with a little gore very little by the standards of the zombie genre but a fair amount by the standards of the buddy picture,black_comedy
when i first saw i wasnt sure what i was watching it was recommended to me by a professor who specifically wanted me to watch it because she knew that id like it for the british humor and she wanted someone to talk to about itis a film that can be viewed in many different ways it can be viewed as a british screwball romantic comedy with zombies or it can be viewed as a zombie movie style parody with injokes and references for zombie fans it can also be viewed as a clear cut zombie movie with jokes sharp writing with clever dialogue make the austin powers of zombie movies i bought it on dvd with the 2004 version of dawn of the dead and ive seen three or four times already and dawn of the dead lays on my couch gathering dust very funny witty cleverly satiric with genx references eery and romantic all come to mind when describing,black_comedy
is my favourite film it has a variety of different tastes of drama the way that it has a romantic side as shaun tries to win liz back it also has a scary side when the zombies attack the living and try to eat them although these parts are a little bit gruesome they are still amazingly funny to watch as the film progresses shaun knows that he has to win lizs heart he risks his life to try and save her plus moaning david and happy dianne this film has a degree of sadness too like when shauns mother is bitten and dies or when david is maliciously eaten by a group of zombies i would recommend this film to anyone that would wish to watch it as it certainly lives up to its name as a rom zom com,black_comedy
somehow i didnt quite find this movie as amusing as what people say it is actually it really did follow it tag line very well a combination of romantic comedy and this time with zombiesyou do get loads of laugh from this movie though some of the stuff is really hard to understand especially the strong british accent and the british jokes though this might be a comedy it did delivered some very gruesome and horrifying images and death than dawn of the dead and other horror movie doesanyway the movie got a great pace and is definitely not even bit boring making it a joy to watchrecommendation tried to watch it couple of timerating 710 grade b,black_comedy
the tag line of this movie cant be truer enough this one treads different grounds and comes out being a blast to watch shaun is 40 percent comedy 30 percent romance and 30 percent horror it is a gradient combination where the first half featured light situations showing how shaun copes up with his relationships then the suspense is eased little by little by the middle of it the comedy is of equal relevance to the zombie epidemic creating humorous events that have never been thought of before towards the end the tensions fill there are liberal amounts of gore in the winchester pub climax one that might come unexpectedly given that the films first hour or so was funfilled though occasionally there are trickles of jokes that drop inits premise might come off as strange but the formula works i wouldnt recommend a sequel thoughthe novelty will wear off if they decide on that,black_comedy
this movie is really a great movie awesome characters for sure shaun is the coolest hes hilarious i love his stepdad too he kind of has a vincent price feeling to him very creepy and you only think the worst of him for a while then theres shauns lovable sidekick he is great comic relief from a tense situation always makes you laugh in the tightest of situations i find it amusing how no one even has the slightest clue that anything is happening yet people all around them are slowly developing into zombies now if anyone is a great fan of the evil dead series they will no doubt love this movie funny how the answer to all their problems consists of either going for a nice cup of tea or a pint at the winchester good stuff the ending is absolutely great it is much like dawn of the dead remake where it just involves someone waking up into the absolute horror except its hilarious i suggest everyone sees this even if you arent a horror movie fan or zombie movie it is still a great comedy movie i would love to see a sequel to this movie anyone agree or should they just leave this as the classic that it is,black_comedy
i suppose i had great expectations when i first heard of this film usually thats a bad cue fortunately this is not the casethis movie had me giggling from the getgo the acting was spoton and though there were a few lags in the plot i found myself really standing up and rooting for the main characters the references to monty python were subtle and the slapstick was wholly effectivea bit predictable but the fresh take on the genre made it worthwhile to watch i found myself envying the filmmakers i wish we could make films like this in the states nearly as well bottle rocket being the exception that first comes to mind810,black_comedy
i think that has actually been one of the best films that i have ever seen in my life it is well written directed casted filmed and acted out to finally achieve the masterpiece of modern filmmaking that it is im sure many of you will continue with your godfathers and your gone with the winds but im afraid that this film is simply the best one ive ever seen an instant cult movie and a genuine classic in the makingsimon pegg edgar wright nick frostbasically anybody who had something to do with do not be afraid to contact me at all id love to hear from you dseriously even if you disagree with me then you must at least admit that its probably the best british film ever no it must be it combines nearly everything into one movielove laughter friendship horror scares thrilling moments cliffhangers romance sviours betraying hate suspenseeverythingrules its a brilliant filmif you havent seen it why not,black_comedy

if you understand that description youll understand just what makes this film so funny i refer of course to the british tv series not the watered down unfunny american version that was aimed at budweiser toting jocks whose idea of a good read is the enquirer or the globeessentially this is british humour at its best and either you like it or you dont its crude thin on plot but hugely funny on comedic timing and farcical situationsreading the message boards i see so many morons ranting about how the special effects were rubbish or the film was boring and they are the people that are really not going to get 99 of the humour in this film they are the people that say eight legged freaks was fantastic cinemais right there with monty python benny hill ab fab fawlty towers and heaven knows what that american tv has done its best to reproduce and consistently failed to do so in usually catastrophic fashion albeit varyingly commercially successful on the networksamerican humour couldnt invent any of these programs they always have to copy them even the office is going to get a workover for heavens sake its like copying the mona lisa it will always be second bestit says it all when friends is probably the most successful us comedy series in england probably the world american writers and actors can find the global funny bone but thats ticklish laughter not the roll over tears in your eyes stomach hurting laughter thats in this filmif youre a fan of british humour you will laugh at this film like its going out of fashion and you tear musclesif you are not im afraid most of it will go over your head but its certainly worth a rental for tryingi would say pegg had his finger on the pulse of what direction dawn of the dead was going to take because there certainly seem to be some broad similarities between the twopersonally i know ill be watching this film again and again with people who havent seen it if only for them to be so grateful as to buy me a pintgedditcheers harry,black_comedy
my favourite horror subgenre is without a doubt the zombie flick theres something much more creepy about a horde of rotting corpses feeding on people than any motherobsessed stalker of scantilyclad teenaged girls or creepy japanese girls stalking single working mothers dont get me started on that theres usually a formula to most american and british zombie movies1 group of survivors hole up in a refuge 2 the government or government agency is responsible for the zombies 3 said government particularly the military cleans up its own mess to save the day 4 the zombies are slow for a reason so that while they slowly swarm the refuge internal tensions amongst the survivors escalate to the point that escape seems impossible 5 the zombies are easy to handle until loved ones join the undead 6 set the comedy dial to black 7 and this is most important from an academic perspective that the zombies are merely an extreme incarnation of the society we live inrecent zombie films have tried some interesting variations on this formula but they just dont satisfy the key is to follow that formula to the letter and have fun with it which brings me to this film is brought to us by twothirds of the team behind british comedy series spaced simon pegg and edgar wright fellow spaced team members jessica stevenson as seemingly female version of shaun and nick frost as ed shauns best friend also star in the film does all of the above and more finally some romance in the movies i personally would love simon pegg to fight the undead for me highlights include shauns walk to the shops after a big night out in which he pays more attention to whether hes buying coke or diet coke than the bloody handprints on the fridge door great use of a queen track yep its better than bohemian rhapsody in waynes world thats a big call but im not afraid to make it and of course the record hurling approach to fighting the undead it may come as a surprise that this film is distributed by a subsidiary of working title films whose romantic comedies with the possible exception of bridget joness diary appear obsessed with selling britain back to itself that aside is more successful than fellow working title production wimbledon which attempts to blend the romantic comedy with the sports movie because it successfully blends the conventions of the romantic comedy with the zombie formula its what weve always wanted isnt it folks,black_comedy
because this is how its done as the worlds first ever romantic comedy with zombies shaun excels in every facet of its story want a decent enough romantic comedy its here although the comedy outweighs the romance want graphic moments of zombie carnage theyre here plot line is simple enough a down on his luck electronics salesman loses his girlfriend after blowing an important date and after hearing the occasional snippet of news about a returning satellite wakes up the next day to a zombie nightmare he then snaps into action going to rescue his mother barbara played by penelope wilton and liz and takes them to the local pub coming along for the ride are shauns college roommate ed nick frost who hasnt quite gotten out of the slacker mode and lizs roommates david and dianne dylan moran and lucy davis great british humor lines practically every frame of the film the romantic aspect is there but never tries to overwhelm the film and when the film kicks in with the zombie aspect in the last third it packs quite a horror wallop everything balances perfectly in the mix and while the comedy does tend to be very prevalent the references to its zombie but dont say that word shaun doesnt like it past is obvious many situations are closer to romeros night of the living dead than the obvious dawn of the dead reference in the title would have you thinkacting is top notch from simon pegg on down to the zombie extras nothings forced nothing comes off as silly or corny this is a perfectly crafted film best of all this isnt even one of those homage type films where you have to look to catch the references they just pop out at you in a groanless glory best film of the year hands down 5 out of 5,black_comedy
im not particularly a fan of british humor but i am a fan of zombie movies and i thought this one was a unique and entertaining example of the genre on the surface this is a funny movie that plays on all the conventions of the zombie genre there are lots of inside jokes and references to other zombie movies from night of the living dead up to 28 days later with a news caster commenting about rage infected monkeys on a slightly deeper level there is a lot of social commentary about how the citizens of the modern industrialized world are increasingly difficult to tell apart from zombies but even the social commentary in the movie comes across as very self conscious because it is commenting on the same themes that romero did 20 years ago on a technical note i think the lighting was very effective for a lower budget movie and the editing was exceptional especially the intro sequence with the seamless wipes across the screen from one shot to the next while shaun goes about his morning routine overall i would say that any fan of zombie movies will really enjoy but its also entertaining enough that it will appeal to people who arent fans of horror zombies or british humor,black_comedy
is a delightfully funny satire of 28 days later   specifically and of zombie movies in general taking place simultaneous to 28 days but in a more suburban location it both spoofs that film and provides yet another alternative and much more amusing ending just when you think the joke has played out and writerdirector edgar wright has literally backed his characters into a corner not only is the script laugh out loud funny but the comic actors produce giggles on sight as they play their slackers completely straight and cheerfully wellmeaning and foibleconsistent throughout as they learn something about themselves even as it pokes fun at this genre that usually has a nebbish rise up to be a hero the loud musical choices add to the ironic merriment even if some are used as complicated background setups for oneliners,black_comedy
i caught a sneak preview for the american release a week after seeing resident evil no less  and have to say that i was extremely impressed contrary to claims that americans wont get it the humor is quite easy to understand and honestly uses a lot of the same slang we use here in the states the dialogue was a bit tough to hear at first possibly a theater speaker problem but otherwise accents are easy to understandfor the zombie movie fan its a treat lots of little references to the original dead films and even a couple amusing references to 28 days later it has the perfect blend of intelligent wit and downright silly humor to make it a fun friday night popcorn flick in my top five for the year85 out of 10,black_comedy
i dont know what is so great about this movie midway through it was starting to get boring there was nothing really original about it either and i did understand the humor or rather humour in the movie so dont give me that story and what is this thing with the 10 lines blah blah blah blah blah,black_comedy
as a zombie fan ive to say im currently over the moon at the upsurge in zombie movies at the moment  from what i can gather ive mr danny boyle and the great 28 days later to thank for that  it seems this has allowed films with the dreaded z word to be bankrolled once again allowing for more undead shenanigans since the late 70seven with all this in mind its amazing that a film like this was made this is a romantic situation comedy where the situation is zombies attacki would have imagined that this would have been stamped too gory for fans of romantic comedy and too soppy for horror enthusiasts leaving it in limbo however due to the success of spaced this was thankfully given a green light and it works and its because of a great cast script and executionof special mention is the first 30 minutes of this film similar to the first few minutes of the latest dawn of the dead but vastly extended we catch glimpses at every turn of the upcoming zombie menace as we follow shaun through his day  its funny in a nervous laughter way  one second we see army trucks that are being sent into contain a problem in south east england on the news only to see them pass by shaun moments later this may not sit well with more impatient audiences but it allows for some shock character development and sets the scene wonderfully  the more attention paid the more youll get out of it  a sequence when shaun flicks through tv stations and effectively misses all the news reports is worth the price of admission alonethe real strength though comes from the fact that this is  a refreshing change from the survival horror computer gameesque zombie films of late it addresses how people would deal with zombies in a much more realistic way than the average zombie flick  certainly from the perspective of a resident of a country which doesnt have a right to bear arms anyway even with access to guns the never ending ammo perfect shot world often portrayed in american zombie films is unrealistic this film has one gun and thats used atrociously  hilariously eg a one liner falling flat on its face because of not cocking a shotguncharacters make do with what they have  they plan poorly and get themselves in bad situations for real reasons  because they are stressed not because of an attachment to a pet  the only exception to this is where the comedy is allowed to overplay the reality of the situation  for example one scene has shaun and his flatmate fight off the zombies with vinyl records  its a bit detracting but also funny enough to justify its inclusion in the filmcomedy elements extend to references to other genre films especially romeros dead trilogy were coming to get you barbra  these are probably included to keep the attention of the zombie nerds who may get bored when there hasnt been a decapitation in three minutes  however this approach is not perfect  there are times when theres probably too much zombies in a row then too much romantic comedy  so if you are there for one or the other you will think the film is dragging  those who can appreciate both will be more than happy though and the moments when they intermingle perfectly are goldall in all if the current zombie film craze wants to last any longer its going to need films like to run with new and interesting ways of using what is in all fairness an already tired and well explored genre,black_comedy
ill have to admit to never having seen spaced but i have seen an awful lot of zombie moviesstarted promisingly with a tacky 70s style synthesiser horror soundtrack merging into the specials ghost town but then rather overdid the slackerscommuters as zombies angle for the first fifteen minutes or soit picked up however and deftly  juggled horror with comedy with pathos for the rest of the movieworth watching if you like zombie movies but not nearly as consistently funny as an american werewolf in london  plus none of the women were a patch on jenny agutter,black_comedy
as a lover of sublime sitcom spaced like millions of fans waiting for i never imagined writer and star simon pegg and director edgar wright could repeat their magic for the big screen thankfully i was wrong sotd is one of the freshest most enjoyable british films ive ever seen and boasts more inventive one liners and set pieces staged for a low budget british movie pegg is on fine form as the hopeless electrical store salesman who finds his authority threatened by a surly teenage coworker his love life is on the rocks and he doesnt get on with his step dad his housemate is a loveably offensive drug dealer who spends all day lounging around the house playing computer games while shauns entire social life seems to consist of going to the pub when zombies appear in london shaun rises to the occasion and leads his band of friends and relatives in a full on battle again the living dead familiar faces from spaced the excellent nick frost peter serafinowicz julia deakin in a brief cameo and some from black books also a nira park production dylan moran and tamsin greig make this a delight while lucy davis and martin freeman from the office also appear bill nighy has a short but memorable appearance as peggs screen stepfather phillip and while the first half of the film is hilarious the second half turns into a genuine horror film as shaun and friends tackle an army of excellent zombies an instant cult classic which some will find disturbing however despite the modest budget wright and pegg have done a fantastic job of delivering one of the best films of the year and indeed the decade the fact that i couldnt wait for it to finish so i could watch it all again is testament to its quality more soon please 1010,black_comedy
edgar wright used to direct the tv scifi comedy series starring simon pegg called spaced now they are reunited to create a great spoof or satire like horror film a love story with some zombies in it shaun pegg is just an ordinary bloke living with his mate ed danger 50000 volts star nick frost and also pete comic relief 2003s terry wogan peter serafinowicz he seems to have a normal life but the next day although he doesnt notice at first the recently dead are coming back to life and eating people he ed and his mum david dylan moran and liz kate ashfield are on the run trying to hide from these creatures also starring trisha goddard bill nighy as philip vernon kay martin freeman as declan tamsin greig as maggie matt lucas as cousin tom and keith chegwin i have seen the dawn of the dead remake and this definitely has the right to spoof it the original is way better it was nominated the bafta alexander korda award for best british film the bafta interactive award dvd and the carl foreman award for the most promising newcomer for nira park producer and it was nominated the british comedy award for best comedy film it was number 3 on the 50 greatest comedy films very good,black_comedy
i am sorry fans but i have to be frank i totally hated that movie why because its an insult to romero fulci etc everything is bad cheap and how my god british humor is awful i couldt laugh during all the movie ok the idea was good ok the principal character is huhappealing kind of puppy but oh my god this movie is maybe the worst ever even leprechaun is better the actors are not funny except the fat guy the story is crappy and cheap andhuh just see the movie youll see dont go to cinema too expensive for that kind of  id rather liked house of waste no great story no great actors butelisha cuthbert is delicious,black_comedy
i dont have any business giving this movie an 8 rating but it was so hilarious i cant help it id heard so much about the film that i finally got around to catching it the other night i really relate to deadpan humor no pun intended and simon pegg was just perfect here with his band of merry misfits trying to outrun a london zombie apocalypse the british colloquialisms are an added bonus newly discovered terms i can now add to my own vocabulary because fried gold and shambolic just sound so cool another mark of an entertaining movie when it makes you think or look things up which i did you can too,black_comedy
ive seen one movie by edgar wright before scott pilgrim vs the world its a great movie but i didnt expect this movie to be anything like that of course well to be honest since i am so used to scott pilgrim vs the world it was a surprise for me how violent this movie turned out to be even though that should be obvious when were dealing with a movie of this genre i didnt know much about this film before seeing it apart from it having zombies in it and that really doesnt tell anything still i assumed this would be like zombieland except a few british spicesof course this movie is quite similar to zombieland or rather zombieland is similar to however has several things that make it better than zombieland the humour is very different in it seems more british and has a lot scarier moments while zombieland is funny action almost all through the movie has situations that feel almost hopeless and you are actually terrified for the characters with zombieland that doesnt work because its such a typical movie you dont really even bother to think something would happen to the characters its just not that type of movie but something about makes you think theres no certainty anyone will survive the funniest thing about this movie is how slowly everyone notices that there are zombies the audience can of course see it and its almost annoying how the characters ignore everything happening around them its funny because it could really happen come on how long would it take from us to see whats happeningis now probably my favourite zombie movie the plot might be typical for a zombie themed film but that doesnt matter its violent its funny and while it might be slightly predictable its still entertaining to watch this might be tied with jennifers body as my favourite horror comedy i got on this ship too late but if theres someone out there who still hasnt seen this film watch it if youre not put off by violence and zombies you wont regret it,black_comedy
blending the genres of horror and comedy together is done well on occasion but more often it is done poorly especially when you look at the scary movie franchise which parodies contemporary horror films by referencing them directly and making surface level jokes out of the situations luckily with we get an intelligent comedy which is original in style and clever with its treatment of a zombie outbreakwe all know the concept of the zombie movie a curse or a sickness or radioactivity etc causes the dead to live again to feed on the flesh and brains of living human beings most of the time they are slow walkers which is the case of wright takes this concept and makes comparisons between the outbreak and normal life for shaun a motif shot used in the film focuses on shaun slowly getting out of bed in the morning walking in a zombielike fashion towards the door while yawning in a way very similar to the noise zombies tend to make the average workingclass man is like a zombie in a swarm lazy conforming to and blending in with the rest of the swarm and insignificant compared to the swarm as a whole2 long takes that are done early in the film also compare society in a normal universe to one filled with zombies shaun is nonchalant in both of these sequences when he walks to a convenience store to buy a few items  he does not notice the difference but in the first sequence he interacts with people a little more than in the second but it seems that he really does not care about his surroundings too much even though they change drastically in the second sequence when the zombie outbreak has already begunwhile this is a zombie movie and is gruesome at some moments with guts and blood the zombie violence seems more cartoonish than disturbing the comedy in this movie outweighs the horror in this film in every fashion including the violencethis film is solid on pacing and editing while it seems to have an average pace at first it really picks up once the zombies become a problem in the film the editing is really interesting making simple actions feel intense by using quick cuts between closeups which force us into the action wright also has an interesting way of putting action scenes in sync exactly to the music in the background in fact a scene involving action to the rhythm of a song by queen proves to be on of the best in the filmthe story itself could be a little more interesting to be honest we never get a thorough explanation of what causes the zombie outbreak though this film does not feel like it needs one the story revolving around shaun and his friends and family is very straightforward  shaun goes through a breakup early on but tries to become a hero for his ex and for his family once he realizes the scale of the situationgood comedy and a few unexpectedly welldone dramatic moments make this film enjoyable to watch3040,black_comedy
this film accomplishes what i want every parody to do add humor but also build a story of your own this film is ingeniously written the story is excellent and it combines serious and humorous elements and it actually worksshaun and his group of survivors serve as excellent contrast for both the comedy and the drama of course like in every edgar wright film the visual comedy separates this film from other comedies that are completely depenant on improvisationas the first of the three flavors cornetto trilogy is a classic and is even on par with the original george a romero films,black_comedy
probably no one will read this but i am a product of genx and narcissistic enough to write a review anyway let me start at the beginning this movie made me laugh uncontrollably and sit on the edge of my seat when i was a young idealistic student now that i am an old cynical hag i still find this movie very entertaining and not just because of the obvious laughs i really think this movie is the perfect movie of my generation i think it has been said before but still this movie is somehow one of the most truthful existential commentaries on postmodern humanity i wont say how it happened because i dont know and i am too lazy to do the real research but i know an existential masterpiece when i see one this movie by using the subtext of a zombie apocalypse  taps into the deepest questions of what it means to be a postmodern adult and the extreme angst that many of the generation x have felt in the disintegration of a family unit and an identity after being raised on such ideals as happy days and the brady bunch and i think it was one of the firsts to tap into that whole zombie apocalypse angst which is now common fodder these characters are so identifiable and lovable that you can follow their journey of discovery and ultimately find hope in the future because really i want to believe,black_comedy
is not your typical zombie movie sure theres lots of blood and gore flesh eating zombies aplenty and fbombs beyond counting and like most zombie flicks this one follows an ever shrinking band of civilians as they try to survive against the undead hordes but unlike resident evil the remade dawn of the dead or 28 weeks later is smart witty and absolutely hilarious for those dazed by grim near identical shootemups with about as much intelligence as the monsters they portray is a breath of fresh airat first it actually seems like a typical slacker comedy shaun simon pegg is a thoroughly average londoner who shares a flat with his friends from high school works the day shift at the local electronics store has issues with his stepfather and is in a rut with his girlfriend who dumps him after he screws up their anniversary in short his life sucks at this point the last thing he needs is hordes of mindless undead knocking at his door but when the zombie apocalypse descends on england it just might be his chance to show hes not a complete loser after allstarts off strong delivering hilarious romantic comedy while dropping ominous hints of what lies ahead like a demented version of the birds and it only gets funnier when the zombies get involved writers pegg and edger wright manage to effortlessly lampoon the clichs and improbabilities common to all zombie films while using over the top gore for comic effect in a manner that would do terentino proud there are few things funnier than seeing two morons throwing records and video games at a pair of glacially slow zombies except perhaps watching them beat said zombies back to death with a cricket bat and a shovel all the while screaming like the warriors they wish they could beeven better is how even amongst terror and destruction the hassles and concerns of everyday life are still there running into old friends and their friends and their friends friends is still awkward even when youre on the run from the living dead your mother remains deeply concerned about you and your stepfather and is happier about finally meeting your girlfriend than frightened by the wandering zombies theres still the one guy who would rather face the walking corpses than spend another minute with the rest of the group and trust me theres no time like the end of the world to work out your relationship issuesthese are the kinds of personal issues that have sunk movies like war of the world but played out to a level of true absurdity they are utterly sidesplitting and the chemistry between cast members is remarkable they bicker argue and get on each others nerves like theyve known each other for their entire lives more than once it occurred to me that this movie could be considered night of the living dead meets the officeisnt for everyone its violent its gory and people in it swear like stevedores but it just might be the best horrorcomedy since the days of abbot and costello and on some level its comforting to know that even during the zombie apocalypse you moms still your mom your roommates still an idiot and you and your sortof girlfriend still have lots of serious issues to discuss,black_comedy
shaun simon pegg is trying to get out of his rut he needs to pick up his game with girlfriend liz kate ashfield he needs to connect more with his mother penelope wilton his slacker friend ed nick frost is annoying his other roommate hes a meek appliance salesman its another bad day in his life but things seem to be happening all around him its the zombie apocalypse and he doesnt notice at all after liz dumps him he has an all night drinking session with ed in the morning the clueless duo come face to face with the walking deadits a little slow at the start it takes awhile to lay down the foundations once they start fighting the zombies the movie is hilarious nick frost is crazy funny its a great new irreverent take on the zombie movie,black_comedy
george romero directed the classic dawn of the dead in 1979 eleven years after his classic night of the living dead is a parody of romeros horror film shaun hangs out in a pub every night and breaks up with his girlfriend along the way he also fights with his mother and stepfatherwhlie suffering from a hangover he and his friends are attacked by zombies the violence is typical and the comedy repetitive and tiresome i do not understand the 810 rating on imdb i usually am a fan of british humor but not this time i would recommend zombieland as an alternative it is far superior movie with an outstanding performance by woody harrelson,black_comedy
this is seriously funny offensive in every way but funny nevertheless a camera tracking shot that gets repeated is just a showcase of both humour and expertise but it doesnt stop there meant as homage to george romero the title of course referring to romeros dawn of the dead and therefor the undead being nothing like the ones from the dawn remake this little movie is pure geniusone of the references involves a phone conversation with barbara which made me laugh out loud in the cinema and i was the only one laughing i almost felt bad about it but then again even romero himself didnt get the injoke if youre a filmmaker youll understand that certain things are more precious to fans of the movies then they are to youbut its not only that its the fact that this movie goes all the way no pun intended i was surprised how brutal it was i didnt know the rating back then it was shown in a sneak preview if you can stomach it this will be one movie youll really enjoy even without getting any references,black_comedy
i have seen the movie and what can i saythis movie made me question the authenticity of imdb ratingsan 8 for this one their is no humor in the movie what so ever its slow i am still getting over this awfully bad movie the only good thing about this movie was that it finishedswot analysisstrengthability to give the viewers a severe headache and mental trauma weakness bad script zero on comedy opportunity should have been a flop but i dont know why it was otherwise threat from all b grade movie this movie just cannot be called an a grade movie so no competition with them,black_comedy
this movie is a hilarious film jokes never fall flat and characters are all memorable there is also a hint of drama that gives it a nice edge many people may say it starts out slow but if you arent entertained by this by the time it is over you arent human it is filled to the brim with british humor which i love i find british humor hilarious the gore is awesome the gore and blood is simply great the actors also give very good performances now there will always be a debate of which is better this or zombieland in opinion this zombieland is a little bit better but this film is great comedy gold4 stars out of 4,black_comedy
i find this movie overrated dont get me wrong here this movie is really really fun but its in the freaking top 250  to keep it simple this movie is a zombie movie with a british comedy twist and i find the first hour very good you get to see some zombies killed get some laughs and have a smile on your face specially with ed played by nick frost his character is just mighty funnymy complaint with the movie is that when the gang lock themselves up in the pub the movie loses my interest the ending is pretty dull to i say again this is by no means a bad movie its pretty darn good but not good enough for a place in the top 250 it could have been so much better if they made this movie like the first hour and stick it full with cool zombie encounters and not let it end with the pub scenekudos for the acting and comedy very nicely donerecommended for every comedy enthusiast,black_comedy
its an english buddyfilm its a romantic comedy its a zombie movie its all three and its great i missed this one when it came out and finally worked my way back to seeing it since my teenager is old enough to enjoy something like this too so i took a gamble what a payoff i never thought i would root for anyone as clueless as shaun and ed ed nick frost goes a long way to endearing himself to the audience he grew on me sort of like the mold you imagine is growing on everything he touches from where he is seemingly permanently installed on shauns sofa bill nighy puts in a short but juicy no pun intended appearance as shauns father  no i mean stepfather if youre up for a good laugh and arent squeamish about the whole obligatory fleshrending arterialsquirting schtick i highly recommend this one then go check out hot fuzz,black_comedy
is one of the best movies ive had the pleasure of seeing not only is it a perfect blend of gruesome zombie horror ala romeros dead series and unique british comedy much like the tv series spaced which is from the same group of guys but it has plenty of heart and is made surprisingly well for a first time film every single actor embellishes their role be it big or small and makes the most out of it which is a major positive edgar wright director shows a style very different to the many other horrorcomedy directors and presents to us an entirely original film he also knows how to reference other films subtlety but still laugh out loud funnythe story written by edgar wright and simon pegg focuses on shaun simon pegg and his current situation in life he lives in a house with his best friend ed nick frost and other friend pete peter serafinowicz and spends most of his nights at the winchester a local pub with girlfriend liz kate ashfield and her friends dianne lucy davis and david dylan moran not only does liz split up with shaun after he fails as a boyfriend he has to cope with his mother barbara penelope wilton and his stepdad philip bill nighy who he hates with a passion and to top it off he has to deal with the undead who have started to rise from ground for the flesh of the livingsimon pegg and nick frost are two actors to watch out for and they really shine in this not only are they comic geniuses they can also act a dramatic scene very well the supporting cast are just as good though and it would be a crime not to mention them as well fans of zombie movies will pick up the the many references scattered throughout and will also appreciate the occasional scenes of carnage is also a great parody and social satire during the opening credits we see people going about their daily business in a zombielike manner implying we are already zombies and the point is further proved when shaun walks through a zombie infested neighborhood going about his daily business and not noticing anything unusualfurther proves that the british are the best when it comes to making comedies and it also seems horror a solid 55,black_comedy
the zombiecomedy genre is somewhat limited to judge as far as the comedy goes it is humorous but not hilarious but then very few movies can sustain the laughs as for the horror it is not and could not compete with the likes of the dawn of the dead remake and there is every reason to avoid that degree of horror as for plot well it is well thought out with a descent preamble that is actually plausible considering it is a zombie movie and is free of the plot holes that seem to plague many movies such as 28 days laterthe main thrust of criticism beyond the inappropriate comparisons with other zombie movies is the humour and characters unlovable behaviour but this misses the key plot element it is a rites of passage movie where shaun has yet to grow up and treat his life and women seriously requiring a crisis for him to move on as a story of the child moving into responsible adulthood even at 29 it is one of the few where the protagonist actually shoots his mother it has its clever moments and part of that is the nature of the adolescent humour without it we would not be able to track his passagedoes a good job considering that it is a low budget comedy horror it may not be american werewolf which is a classic but it is as funny and as a movie the script and plot are a whole lot more tighter than dog soldiers or 28 days or 28weeks it is not going to be as scary or horrific as zombie movies but it is comparable imho to the original dawn of the dead that had the depth of observation as part of the subplotit seems to be one of those movies that will be compared when it needs to be judged on its own merits,black_comedy
whether you like horror or comedy you will find this movie outstanding the lead characters are so perfectly portrayed by simon pegg and nick frost that you cant help really feel this movie its like watching your best friends get themselves into the biggest mess humanly possible youll laugh your head off while being terrified and totally grossed out this film is one of the best i have ever seen in my life ive probably watched it over 20 times and still love it this is the only dvd i have that ive actually played all of the extra or deleted scenes it has a full presentation of how this film was made and great commentary im glad these guys got together for another film hot fuzz because i know i just cant get enough of this fantastic duo,black_comedy
i really couldnt make up my mind whether this was a slacker film or a zombie film it seems to be a little of both shaun simon pegg and ed nick frost seem like slackers who like to play video games and sahun is certainly lazy and inconsiderate where his girlfriend kate ashfield is concerned but the film quickly moves to the zombie part and that is where the real laughs begin of course shaun is quick on the uptake not a surprise for a slacker and doesnt get the fact that there is danger right away no prob the cricket bat works where the records and flatware doesnt it is a brilliant sendup of the zombie genre and the funny bits are just too numerous to mention also includes pirates star bill nighy who will join pegg and frost this weekend in hot fuzz even if you are not a horror fan you will find this hilarious cant wait for friday to get here,black_comedy
shaun is a loser of that there is no doubt he shares a north london house with pete an uptight professional and a total slob called ed ed is his best mate from school and shaun feels very protective of him shaun works as a sort of team leader in a branch of an electrical shop where he suffers the daily tedium we have all felt when you work in a job you dont really like his girlfriend liz is dragged along by him every night the the winchester his local pub as shaun always brings ed along ed doesnt have many friends so liz brings along her flat mates david and dianne after being dumped by liz for forgetting to book a restaurant and for trying to give her flowers destined for his mum shaun and ed proceed to get massively drunk in the winchester and head home to play loud music annoying pete in the process however the next morning and with huge hangovers shaun and ed begin very slowly to realise that this is not a normal sunday it doesnt matter if you dislike horror films romantic comedies or if you arent a fan of british humour this film will raise a chuckle at least and have you roaring with laughter at best george a romero is a fan as is quentin tarrantino high praise indeed my favourite moment well there are so many to choose from so i have to narrow it down to three 1 shauns sunday visit to the local shop where he fails to notice zombie nelson at the back of the shop the bloody hand print on the drinks chiller and what it was on the floor which he slipped in 2in the lounge after their battle with the two zombies in the back garden where they are deciding on the best course of action ed so what are we gonna do now shaunhave a sit down 3 when they are in the garden next to the winchester shaun checks that the coast is clear by climbing up the steps of a childs slide superb comic timing shaunim just going to check that the coast is clear climbs up few steps leaving us just with a shot of his legs and shoes on the rungs pause for a few seconds climbs back down into shot liz well is it clear shaunno davidso how many are there shaun sounding like hes going to crylotsgreat film i urge you to watch it,black_comedy
shaun is gen x everyman he finds a way to take 90s slacking skills and use them to save the world it makes me feel like i too may have something to offer if we are one day taken over by the living dead more more more more the beauty of this film is the goodness of shaun he takes risks for the people he loves he deserves to win simon pegg and edgar wright are the voice of every man i have ever wanted to pash i love nerdy boys who like cricket fabulous cast call me a shallow bookish thirtyish girl but ill pay good money to see dylan moran read the phone bookhang on i think he does that in his stand up act this film is in my top five of all time,black_comedy
the first of the socalled romantic zombie comedies or romzomcoms to those of us in the know is an adorable romance with a sharp comedic edge in addition it delivers some punches just as terrifying as those in such zombie movie classics as night of the living dead or dawn of the dead great as a date movie a halloween horror flick or a latenight comedy to watch instead of studying for finals is destined to become a cult classicthe story revolves around shaun simon pegg cowriter of the movie with edgar wright a loser whose already complicated personal life begins to spiral out of control when his girlfriend liz kate ashfield dumps him because he forgets to make dinner reservations for their anniversary on top of this he is scolded by his stepfather philip played by a wonderfully crusty bill nighy for failing to bring his mother barbara penelope wilton flowers on mothers day and gets into a shouting match with pete peter serafinowicz the more responsible of his two roommates pete accuses shaun of only letting ed nick frost his video game playing pot dealing perpetually drunk best friend stay with them because hes more of a loser than you all of this is even before shaun wakes up the next morning depressed and hung over from a night of trying to drown his sorrows at the local pub the winchester to discover that london has turned overnight from a bustling metropolis into a city of the undead this is the moment when takes off as both a horror movie and a comedymuch of the films comedy comes from simply pushing the usual zombie thriller and romantic comedy clichs too far in one of the most hilarious and paradoxically chilling sequences of the entire movie shaun stumbles blearily through his morning routine completely blind to the zombies in the streets and the dead bodies lying in gardens this sequence parodies the idea that the audience always gets a glimpse of the impending disaster before the characters we have been seeing signs of the zombie infestation since the beginning of the film but shaun and ed fail to notice it until a girl in their garden falls and impales herself on a pipe that goes completely through her body then struggles back up and keeps staggering towards themat this point shaun and ed decide to ignore all rational advice and venture out of their apartment which is not really a safe place anyway since pete has been bitten by a zombie and will soon become one of the undead himself to find liz and barbara and take them to the safest place they can think of the winchester all does not go according to plan however and shaun ed liz barbara and lizs roommates david and dianne dylan moran and lucy davis end up walking through the backyards of the london suburbs having lost both their car and the blunt objects they were using as weapons for defense against a zombie attack things only get worse from there and by the time the hapless group reaches the winchester an argument concerning shauns treatment of liz has exploded between shaun and david and one of their number has fallen victim to a zombie bite shaun and davids argument is a wonderful example of standard romantic comedy writing that is funny because of its juxtaposition to the army of the dead waiting outside the pubthis sort of exaggerated comedy begins in the opening credits when we see the people of london moving zombielike through their daily routines many of them appear later in the film trying to feast on the flesh of shaun and his cohorts the satirical edge continues until the end of the film where various tv clips lampoon the careless way that people trivialize immense tragedy moments of slapstick are likewise woven into the entire movie some notable scenes include shaun and ed sorting through shauns record collection to determine which albums are of lowenough quality to use as weapons against the undead and in what is possibly the best use of a queen song since mike meyers rocked out to bohemian rhapsody shaun liz and ed smashing out a zombies brains to dont stop me nowdespite the hilarity of the comedy the movie manages to do what any good horror film should do pack a frightening punch the feeling of fear is introduced early in the movie as glimpses of the zombie epidemic create a building sense of unease and continues until the fate of the living is finally decided the zombies may be ridiculously slow and dullwitted but they can be terrifying especially when large numbers of them are bearing down on shaun and his friends it is this combination of comedy horror and good oldfashioned romance which guarantees that the first of the romzomcoms is well on its way to becoming a cult classic,black_comedy
i think that this movie was hilariousi watched it about three timesit made me laugh all the way through until the endit was funny how when shaun woke up in the morning all the zombies were walking around and he didnt even see them and then the part where they thought that girl was drunk and then shaun was making a plan on how to stay safe until it was all over that was funny tooand when they had planned to go to the pub and act as zombies when that girl told shauns mom that she was doing a good job and his mom was just standing there not doing anything that made me die laughing no jokei recommended it to my friends but they thought i had it mistaken with dawn of the dead but yeah ill recommend it some more,black_comedy
wow that name really rings a bell surprisingly i didnt get the name until like two days ago and i finally realized that it meant dawn of the deadin spite of my stupidity this movie is so funny british humor is the best kind of humor there is this movie stars some unknown actors simon pegg mission impossible iii the reckoning nick frost kinky boots penelope and kate ashfield crime and punishment the war zonenot only does this movie bring nonstop deepbellylaughs its also deliciously gory as every zombie movie is but its really not that gory theres just a scene where a zombie falls on a pole and a huge fountain of blood spurts out of her body and theres a couple more but i cant think of them at the top of my head right now sorrywhats better than zombies invading a town and then leaves two sloppy and lazy friends shaun pegg and ed frost to kill them all whats more of an unbeatable combination between horror and comedy whats better than totally unknown actors bringing hilarity to people nothing there is nothing better than a zomrom com the nickname for a zombiecomedysee this movie it is so worth your money my mpaa rating r zombie violencegore and strong language my canadian rating 18a gory violence frightening scenes coarse language,black_comedy
a man simon pegg decides to turn his moribund life around by winning back his exgirlfriend kate ashfield reconciling his relationship with his mother penelope wilton and dealing with an entire community that has returned from the dead to eat the livingwhat makes this film atypical of most horror films is that it is not a horror film at all but a romantic comedy only it is a romantic comedy filled with zombies and headcrushing action we follow shaun who fights to win his girlfriend liz back fights zombies that isthe humor is distinctly british and some of the humor relies on a familiarity with the show spaced which is probably not well known to the general audience much of the jokes are also obscure references to other horror films but most of the humor is universal as we all probably know what it is like to have a bad day have a bad job and have things go wrong with a great woman or man as the case may be and all too many of us know what it is like to live with a deadbeat roommatethe zombie effects are pretty decent though not as gory as in many films the humor outweighs the scary obviously the scenery is great and many of the scenes are so derivative of dawn of the dead that it is hard not to like this film some scenes some music and even some dialog is lifted directly from romero such as news broadcasts and the classic were coming to get you barbara i enjoyed the multiple times a character was told not to call the zombies zombies because it calls to mind the great difference between horror movie characters and horror movie viewers horror movie viewers know romero made zombie films but the word zombie is not used in those films even the dawn remake never once calls them zombies i do not know if i would make this a mustsee movie but it is one of those films that everyone has seen so you probably would not be a true horror fan unless you have seen it too and the way it went on to influence zombie films and zombie comedies over the next decade is incredible culminating in the nearlyasgood cockneys vs zombies that any shaun fan should be sure to see stephen king proclaimed it was destined to be a cult classic he was right,black_comedy
spoilers of the dead in 2004 a little gem arrived from britain a romantic zombie comedy yes you read that right which was fun romantic and scary practically a one of a kind but on to the story shaun simon pegg is a loser who at 29 has a lousy job and lives with a really immature best friend ed nick frost managing to unwittingly destroy his relationship with liz kate ashfieldafter having been dumped by her shaun decides to put his life into some kind of order too bad the dead are coming back to life but please dont say the zedword its ridiculousafter finding out about it and believe me it takes a while and noticing their third roommate pete peter serafinowicz has actually become a living dead himself shaun and ed set on saving shauns mother barbara one character actually says were coming to get you barbara  remember notld penelope wilton shauns stepfather who has been bitten bill nighy liz and her snooty friends david dylan moran and diane lucy davisthey have one destination the winchester pub the one where shaun and ed pass their whole days will they get there and who will survive there are some homages to famous zombie movies  notld one of the female characters vanishes into a flood of zombies dawn of the dead a character is ripped apart much like tom savinis 28 days later wont tell find it yourselves  which for living dead lovers like me are really the icing on the cake and really funny moments deciding what vinyls to throw at zombies dire straits chuck it or its the second record i ever bought shaun and a smiling living dead girl getting photographed by ed eds cellphone going off at a rather inopportune moment shaun missing out on obvious clues about the living dead namely one hysterical scene in which he does zapping and all the programs he watches complete each others sentence which should drive home the message to shaun but it doesnt and the funniest scene  when shaun meets yvonne and her own band of survivors which mirror shaun and the other five as i have seen also in tv work  yvonne worked on spaced with pegg if im not wrong and there were tim from the office  lucy davis is from the office too and fran from black books  dylan moran david plays in it tooand you just cant fault romero tarantino and peter jackson for having liked this so much and romero for having wanted pegg and frost in land of the dead1010,black_comedy
this is the only modern zombie movie that i could actually sit through and enjoymainly because it makes fun of the genre throughout now dont get me wrong i enjoy horror moviesits just the idea of the dead walking and eating you aliveits too ridiculous but this movie is hilarious the horror aspect of the movie is only in the violence which is also part of the comedy aspect there are a lot of funny situations in this movie and it is a good movie just to sit with a bunch of buddies and laugh like idiots the violence in this movie is over the top and bloody but is is supposed to be funny which it is the language is constant with plenty of uses of the fword and i believe a few of the sword there is very little sexual content except for this line get f four eyes i enjoyed this movie and found it hilarious and i recommend you see soon if you havent already,black_comedy
this movie was great i got it for christmas and i watched it that night it was so awesome it has a humane story about a man who has to protect the woman he loves and his family and friends from zombies who are ready to make a buffet out of them its an awesome story with a lot of humor and some pretty cool action simon pegg is awesome as shaun a dude whos life is on the fast track to nowhere all he does is go to work and then go to a bar called the winchester every night his girlfriend liz is tired of it and wants things to change but when he forgets to reserve a table at a nice restaurant she dumps him he then is sad and stays up all night he then wakes up the next day and doesnt even realize that there are zombies on the streets when two zombies attack shaun and his bosom buddy the slacker ed they realize that their homes are not safe and decide to go to the winchester which is extremely hard to break into he then goes and rescues his parents and his ex and her friends in a jaguar they then have to fend for themselves in the barthis movie was awesome it was funny and had a lot of good humor it was a great comedy to watch and is on my favorites list,black_comedy
when me and a couple of mates rented this we thought it obviously was some kind of parody of dawn of the dead which just had been released isnt really a parody of dawn its much more than that its really a straightfrom life romantic comedy with wellzombies it couldnt be more right after seeing it it stuck in my mind so i had to buy it latereven though its a comedy the story is really apocalyptic and like in dawn the city gets invaded by zombies which is nothing you saw in dawn of the dead as funny but rather horrible simon pegg and nick frost are really convincing as regular guys trying to make the best out of the situation they are also extremely funny while doing it just thinking about the movie makes me smile see it now,black_comedy
i just watched and i have to say im a bit disappointed cause it had a 79 imdb rating i did expect a bit more from a movie which is rated so high but anyway its not a bad movie at all it starts a bit boring when the main character shaun is introduced but as soon as the zombies come into play it gets fun shaun turns into a hero  like lionel from peter jacksons braindead  and the movie turns into a amusing splatter  comedy another point which is to be mentioned is that there arent that many splatter scenes in this movie i mean if you compare it to other zombie films youre gonna know what i mean so although is not a bad movie you can be sure that there are better movies of this genre  braindead army of darkness and many others  so i think its overratedanywaywatch it,black_comedy
i like zombie movies old as well as new is both a parody of the zombie genre and also a satirical comment about how ordinary life makes us act like zombies for instance we get to see the zombielike appearance of people at work and people on the street this element is well thought out and quite clever it makes fun of the stupid and slow zombies which ends up in some sporadically fun scenes as in all zombie movies the main characters takes ages to discover what is going on and in the its overdone in a hilarious way the story itself is basically where does a british lowlife run for protection answer the pub short period of laughter followed by boredom the story is boring and not at all fun and the great moments of parody or satire are to few to save the moviefun moments but nothing more510,black_comedy
in 2003 britain tried its hand at the zombie film and failed with the frankly miserable 28 days later then the zombie subgenre was given another film in 2004 the hugely disappointing remake of the classic dawn of the dead and both of these things were leading me think that this parody of the zombie genre might miss the mark as well but suffice to say this one doesnt disappoint if youre expecting to be rolling around on the floor laughing at this movie youll be disappointed but although its never hilarious it does keep itself going with a series of giggles which is sure to delight any viewer the plot follows shaun a young slob that spends most of his time drinking in the pub and playing video games with his even lazier friend when his girlfriend dumps him on the grounds of him being an unreliable loser he thinks its the end of the worldand actually it is as for some reason the population of london has been transformed into flesh eating zombies and its now up to shaun with the aid of his trusty cricket bat to save the day i often find myself disliking films that spoof the horror genre as theres just something i dont like about someone taking the michael out of something i love but some of the sequences in really are inspired moments of comedy the parts that see the shaun go about his daily businesscompletely unaware that people around him are eating each other show a rare brilliance that few comedies have ever matched as youve probably heard simon pegg and edgar wright have labeled this film aromzomcom which of course means that it is a romantic comedy with zombies thats almost exactly what it is with the romantic comedy making up the structure of the movie and the zombies being thrown in afterwards ironically since most people will see this for the zombies the romantic comedy elements of the movie are on the whole funnier than the parts with the zombies after a great initial forty minutes after which is when the zombies start to really come into play the movie loses steam and you dont find yourself giggling so often however its forgivable as the comedy gets replaced by some great horror sequences many of which are lifted from the zombie classics such as romeros dead trilogy and the evil dead filmsstars two of the main players from the cult comedy spaced simon pegg and nick frost along with a couple of other regulars from that show and some other players from various british comedy shows i have to admit to never having watched spaced but i can see that its written by two obviously talented people and i may well give it a try on the strength of this film simon peggs performance is silly but believable at the same time he does actually appear to be doing an impression of the offices david brent for most of the movie but thats fine with me pegg and frost get to play with a nice assortment of weapons for this film from cricket bats to snooker cues to shotguns and more but no chainsaw and its a lot of fun seeing them running around and bashing the undead on the head this film is a lot of fun on the whole and i am proud to say that this decade finally has a good zombie film and im even more proud to say that it originates from my home nationeven if its cast do drink carling black label,black_comedy
one of my biggest beefs behind my major disappointment of was that for more than half of the goddamn time i could not  i repeat  i could not understand wtf anyone was saying im not kiddingyeah ok i know damnwell that everyone was indeed speaking english or at least i think they were but with all of the bloody heavyduty british accents and the weirdalien slang and the annoying way that everyone was always running all their goddamn words together  well  as you can wellimagine it was making me so absolutely crazybelieve me there were manymany times when i know for sure that i had just missed out on getting the punchline of yet another killerdiller joke but because my ears just werent tuned into the incomprehensible way that everyone was speaking the english language  well  i totally missed out on yet another bellylaughand besides not being able to comprehend the unbelievably garbled lingo of these british boys and girls  i detested the final climax of this film big time it was such a blatant rip off from night of the living dead it was and all that i could do while it was happening was just yawn my head off until it was all over it was really that dreary and dull to me,black_comedy
a zomcomromhorror expertly mixes widely different genres into a tightly packed incredibly fun hour and half scamper around west london the humour is there if not gut bustlingly funny but this film is all about its scenarios its quirks and its surprisingly good effects tangled into the plot there are some touching moments to go with the mania and the final resolution of the film is extremely satisfying i can understand how this film has garnered such a devoted cult following since it is such an enjoyable movie with a great cast all stuffed into its quaint little universe watch it,black_comedy
what can i say ive had several friends rave about this movie so i thought i should watch it despite the fact that ive never seen a zombie movie i liked if stupid plot lines and stupid people performing stupid actions make you laugh this is probably your kind of movie i get irritated watching crap like this apparently i need to go into more detail about why i hate this movie as imdb wants at least 10 lines of text to submit this review if you want to laugh at zombie movies id recommend zombieland as that is considerably funnier than thisblahblahblahblah blah blah blah bladthis movie sucks,black_comedy
i am the furthest thing from an anglofile there is i cannot stand them i hate the english to my core and think we separated with that nation for a reason with some exceptions like monty pythonyou cannot get me to watch are you served or half a dozen of other british things i think they are shiitesimon and nick win my exception in this i love them to the point ive bought everything theyve done afterwardsits glorious and funnyas a george romero extra myself they do gloriously fulcis nice i hate british humor and love this film along with everything else pegg and nick do,black_comedy
i was really looking forward to watching this film as everyone was raving about what a brilliant scary film it was what also made me want to watch the film was that it was made in britain and until recently there has been real surge of horror films made in britain which i am glad abouti was a little disappointed when i finished watching it it wasnt rubbish but it wasnt excellent i think what has left me with mixed feelings about is the film seems to be mainly a comedy and there are some very funny bits which i will get back to in a minute the thing is all these funny things happen and youre laughing away and then the film changes tact and becomes more serious with shaun having to kill his mum after she is beaten by a zombie and then dianne and david being killed by the zombies it just didnt sit right for the film to suddenly go down this route when basically for most of the film we were laughing at the antics of the zombies and i just couldnt get back into the film after seeing him kill his own mother i even wondered because the violence involved towards the end if it would turn out to be all a dream but it wasnt to be i feel like the film couldnt decide what genre it was going to be and if it was to be more horror driven then there should not have been as much comedy as there was so in that respect i think the film let itself down therethe other part of me liked the film especially at the start when we see that we are in a way zombies ourselves we all go to work queue in lines go shopping without really thinking about what we are doingi love the fact that shaun is an antihero in this he is in a job that is mundane and noone respects him there he spends all his time going to the pub and just drinking and isnt interested in doing anything else then londons population starts to turn into zombies and he becomes a leader who the others turn to to get them out of the situation they are in and he finds himself battling zombies and becoming the most unlikely hero you have ever seen on filmi was in stitches with the humour especially when the zombies are introduced into the story line i have mentioned down below my favourite humorous scenes one scene is when shaun and ed have shauns record collection and they are debating about what records to throw at zombies while the zombies are coming towards them two shaun introducing his girlfriend to his mother when they are trying to get away from the zombies three shauns gang meeting up with yvonnes gang who are basically the same type of characters but played by wellknown television actors that have worked with shauns simon pegg gang in other television programmes classic the last is the duke box playing queens dont stop me now when they are beating up the zombie landlord with pool cuesi think the zombie make up works so well and is so convincing and i like the fact the film doesnt take itself too seriously,black_comedy
i rarely watch horror movies and that is a personal precedent that might be given leeway now thanks to with memorable characters subtle humor genuine emotive scenes and conversations and a jovial hellbent fight scene involving a man beating a zombie to death while queen plays on the jukebox cements this new twist on the slacker comedy as creative and groundbreaking even though this has been done before in my other favorite horror movie idle hands oh well i guess the phrase great minds think alike is true is blessed and armed with an almostoriginal script deft direction and the show stealer of the movie nick frost who plays the fat slothlike pothead sure the last third of the movie may drag on but i have had a rewarding time watching the shrewdness of the crises between the characters and the laurel  hardy chemistry between simon pegg and nick frost i guess i can see now why the british are better at executing films than us they rely on knowledge and inside jokes while we utilize recycled toilet humor damn we suck but thats a different story for a different timesimon pegg plays a slacker named shaun who is definitely in dire straits and has an idyllic boring unfulfilling life for the time being what happens to shaun is enough to make an average guy depressed his girlfriend liz kate ashfield dumps him he has a sour relationship with his stepfather bill nighy a tense roommate who cant stand his pathetic friend nick frost a dismal job and the icing of the cake is fighting zombies during the tenure of the weekend a zombie outbreak spreads with shaun and everyone he knows totally oblivious to the matter which is pretty clever considering that the director edgar wright has put so much dramatic irony and clues leading up to what happens next and shaun and his friend ed nick frost dont figure it out until one of the outbreak victims show up at the flat after the guys finish killing the zombies invading the fort they try to save their friends and family with dire straits happening now and then usually antagonized by lizs friend an arrogant oaf named david dylan moransimon pegg and edgar wrights screenplay is gifted in the way that they shape out shauns character by using the zombie plot as the backdrop of him changing as a person in the beginning of the film you would assume that shaun is really irresponsible and that he was just like a character in a sitcom that doesnt really make a change or develop until the last season but the way wright and pegg make use of the plot to change shaun is beyond belief if the plot centered on something else shaun wouldnt have come to amends with his stepfather or find out about the nature of david and why hes acting like such a tool towards him the film also fares well in its dramatic shift of tone and genre when the ragtag team tries to find fortress in the town pub i guess that what stands out in sotd for me is the relationship between frost and pegg when these two are paired up together primarily in conversations theres no end to all the absurd shtick that frost provides and the levelheaded answers that pegg would give him all in all there are many other qualities that make sotd one of the coolest cult flicks including deer hunter and the dead series references ever and its everything youll ever want in a movie its a pulsating horror movie at least three or four parts an enigmatic look on people who find out more about themselves in midst of danger and a straightforward riotous comedy,black_comedy
simon pegg wrote this story and plays the title character as a british twit who cant do anything right and his life is heading into the crapper and then the flesheating zombies attack some pretty good laughs in the first half as we find out what a useless piece of garbage shaun and his fat and idiotic friend ed are they decide that the best strategy for avoiding the killers is to head to their favorite bar then the movie forgets about the comedy and just turns into another zombie film quite a bit of gore with zombies being impaled right and left and blood gushing out over everythingbest thing in the movie is shauns former girlfriend liz played by kate ashfield very very sexy,black_comedy
the critical phenomenon inspired is baffling i saw it in the theater found it a lightly diverting item with a touch of humor amid the horror the romantic and domestic drama isnt nearly as successful but nowhere near the brilliant masterpiece horror fans and mainstream critics were hailing it as maybe i have a bit of resiliency towards thickaccented english romps but feels dramatically awkward and stilted in its humor it plays out with a hand thats more heavy than incendiary even the zombies and their ensuing carnage lack grit and terror that being said this homage to george romeros dead trilogy has its moments as we follow thankless twentysomething shaun simon pegg and his deadbeat roommate ed nick frost as they navigate through an unexplained zombie plagueso that shaun can reconcile with his estranged girlfriend liz kate ashfield in the end its pervasive sincere charm and some clever injokes shaun works at foree electronics for instance keep shaun watchable but the premise is ultimately funnier than the movie itself,black_comedy
just reading the back cover or seeing the previews for this film you know exactly what to expect but can the british pull off a comedic dawn of the dead that is funnier than the original well maybesimon pegg plays shaun an ordinary guy who is clueless about romance and the dereliction of his friend ed nick frost in a hilarious portrayal of just how oblivious someone can be to the world around him shaun bent on winning his girlfriend back travels the city with zombies wandering about it isnt until much later that he and his buddy ed discover they are the new minority in town there are some very funny scenes like attacking a pair of zombies with a record collection and zombie impersonation as a means of disguise for a silly brainless look at the recent zombiefilm resurgence 28 days later dawn of the dead etc watch 610,black_comedy
after going over countless reviews trailers and most of all peer pressure i went to seeit filled my every expectation which in this case is a very bad thing about halfway through the movie theyve gone through about every possible hey ed theres a zombie at the doorjokes you can think of thus ruining its original satirical concept which leaves you with the horror that apart from the guy getting torn apart is pretty standard zombiestuffdont get me wrong i had some fun but 3 big laughs in 99 minutes is not what i expect from a movie that pretends to be above all a comedy i guess i need more than the same old fartjokes and loserantics you can find better in just about every british sitcom out thereyou could see every line from 100 miles away so predictable it hurts i cant help but wonder what people who think this is intelligent comedy consider dumb comedy not to get all condescending but calling this a masterpiece or a cult movie sends shivers down my spinei read a review here that pretty much sums it up for methe movie could have been reduced to a very funny 45 minute sketch as part of a general comedy showand thats true its the same jokes again  again  again and by the time the movie runs out of the clichs it made for itself it switches to complete horroryawn of the dead indeed,black_comedy
after waiting with baited breath for this film to surface i finally made it to the cinema yesterday to see it the british nationals have been going crazy for this film needless to say being a spaced fan and a huge zombieflick fan i had very high expectations for this filmit is with regret however that im not rating this film nearly as high as i wanted towhich is a shame yes potentially the concept sounded extremely promising  simon pegg is a very intelligent and witty guy and his work on spaced and big train was superbit just failed to raise any serious humour in my eyes that was so evident in peggs other and earlier work i know many people would have seen this film with preconceptions of his style and humour but for me shauns humour lacked a fair deal of subtlety and the gags were few and far between coupled with the more serious element behind the film  like losing your best friend and having to kill your own mother   the film becomes a mixed affair that isnt quite as lighthearted as one would imaginetheres a fulfilling amount of gore to keep some of the horrorfans satisfied and the fanboys among us will no doubt pick up on some of the more subtle allusions to the horror genre there were also a couple of shock moments which were successfully done but overall it seemed to be carrying a few too many flaws and its positioning between horror comedy romcom and satire seems so tightly interwoven that it becomes a muddled affair whereby it doesnt know it its truly coming or going in closing  good special effects for the zombies good soundtrack bill nighy some nice cameo roles some mildly funny slapstick moments but sadly could have been considerably better 510,black_comedy
this is one of these films that got hyped to high heavens when it was released in britain and thought it might have been simply down to being a british film that did well at the box office  strangely becoming a cult hit on the international scene didnt tarnish its reputation and it spent several years in the imdb top 250 and now all most ten years after its release it still has an average user rating of 8  very strange i say very strange because its not really a film i have ever got in to  i think its because the plot is a one trick pony  man wakes up to find zombies roaming around and doesnt realise it until its almost too late  its very often a bad idea when segments of a film has the audience one step ahead of the characters  perhaps not so much a bad idea but the makers have to do something to grab the audiences attention and here in my opinion theyve failed  theres also the added problem that danny boyles quasi zombies that can run faster than an olympic sprinter had come out at the same time so the undead here who stagger around arent much of a menace to the characters if the film has anything going for it then its the editing which is quite impressive as one scene segues in to another but apart from that i wasnt too impressed by any other of the aspects of the film  a lot of people here have mentioned channel 4 sitcoms such as spaced and black books which other shows ive found it difficult to get in to so i guess the producers know what their market is,black_comedy
ive heard a lot of things about this movie and how funny it is but after seeing it myself i have to disagree its the predictable zombie movie with the usual gore and violence i chuckled at a few parts but overall it was rather drab and boring the beginning was quirky and humorous but as it went on it seemed as if they had run out of ideas and completely lost the plot perhaps i just have a short attention span but by the last half hour or so i couldnt concentrate on it at all not to mention it actually got a bit sad at parts which i really didnt expect coming from a comedy really the only thing that held this movie together was the decent casting i wouldnt say the movie was downright terrible but i certainly wouldnt recommend it if youre looking for a real quality picture,black_comedy
ive read a lot about how borrows a lot from a tv show called spaced i have to admit that ive never heard of spaced but even so this movie is still really great more than just a zombie movie  or even just a spoof  its sort of a look at how various factors in our lives make us zombielike everything has a very english feel to it and the zombies themselves are almost hypnotic id never heard of simon pegg before seeing sotd but i can certainly say that he does a hilarious job as the outandout brit having to battle the living dead definitely worth seeing also starring penelope wilton kevin klines wife in cry freedom and bill nighy,black_comedy
i bought this at the mall for 10 dollars ive never saw it before and thought it was the best thing ever the movie is original and funny it is what would really happen if such a thing happened but i would hide in my tree house nice and high my favorite part in the movie was when he told us of his grand plan and when him and his group were hiking in the backyards hopping fences and such i think they should joined forces with the other group if you ask me but i thought hot fuzz was better but i had the wrong impression of what it was aboutits not the worst film ive ever saw but then why did i sold it to my friend for 5 dollars what was i thinking,black_comedy
what a load of rubbish useless script useless storyline irritating acting embarrassing to watch them try actually devoid of emotion tear inducing purely from a boredom sense pathetic production complete failure to allure the viewer need i say more no i dont think so avoid at all costs if you love quality film and dont wish to waste a couple of hours of your life aha according to the site rules i need to complete ten lines of text for my review to comply with the rules hard to write ten lines about such a dire production so i apologise dear reader for extending my pure loathing of this film to you for longer than necessary in my attempt to help some people save some valuable time by not watching sht should replace the word shaun in all honesty i have had to waste extra time of my own in warning you i hope this was not in vain and helps at least 1 other person kind regards,black_comedy
i really dont see why this has received such a high rating wait a minute maybe because so many brits can identify with the character of ed or perhaps maybe because living in the uk really does turn you into a zombie despite the realistic portrayal of typical britishness the story is slow and boring the plot weak and really fails to take off i couldnt help but pray for the main characters to be the first ones that go it seems that certain flicks automatically earn points just for being british productions i read that zombieland was the american the two films are very different the former was actionentertainment right from the start the latter not,black_comedy
i found it a horrible movie the humor was often not funny and i could not wait till it would end i am a great fan of zombie movies and i have a decent sense of humor but this movie it was rated with a 8 so i expected to have fun at least but it was horrible if you expect a movie worth an 8 i recommend you to not watch it this movie is written around a british no live guy were nothing really changes in his live when the zombies come he only get his girlfriend sort of back which he could better have dumped anyway she is definitely not pretty so this does not make the movie any better and his fat friend is a complete idiot and in stead of being a funny fat guy he is a annoying fat guy the rest of the characters are also really not funny and not even interesting the two i can remember are a dumb scared nerd and his bossy girlfriend who is also not pretty and all they are gonna do is go to the pub they always were,black_comedy
okay ill speak here like the typical british tool that comments on american movies this movie sucks how dare it show the british military coming in and saving the day thinking england is the best country is the world thats complete rubbish how could someone from their own country have anything good about their militaryto be honest i dont care if a country puts their own military in a film it shows they like their own country which they should so to all you british dumbfks who comment on american movies about our military how about this dont watch our movies and watch your own garbage for films i have nothing against any other country so why are you so blatantly hateful towards the united statesnow that i got that out of the way this movie wasnt very funny im kind of over the whole zombies thing can someone think of a new type of film,black_comedy
the movie is as pathetic as the room dont waste your time watch anything else then this one,black_comedy
no laughs no excitement just a pathetic loser of a movie all the characters were losers and it was difficult to see how being a zombie would change any of them for the worse this movie was designed for morons by morons and could only be liked by those who get drunk at the pub on warm beer every night of their pathetic lives and who think that english soccer is more exciting than watching the grass grow,black_comedy
another notfunnyatall romantic comedy in apocalyptic setting what a shame,black_comedy
the worst movie that ive ever watched in my life,black_comedy
is a classic that have aged well not too dependent on effects it feels like it could have been made last year instead of 15 years ago one of the first movies of what has now almost turned into an genre world war z i am legend and son on it still has a unique and what still feels like a fresh perspective on the zombie apocalypse instead of being scary simon peggs shaun intends to do so well but it never works out as he wants it to often with quit fun implications he and his friend ed not the brightest men around try to rescue shauns exgirlfriend and mother evacuating them from their homes to take refuge in the winchester pub and if you cant outrun the zombies you need to fight them and if you cant fight them you migt as well try to blend init is a good idea a fun story with quite a lot of good scenes and moments with a lot of laughs however a few of the characters are just too much they are too ignorant too stupid just too much i think of ed and shauns mother barbara by exaggerating the characters they go from fun to annoying and that ruins quite a few scenes unfortunately it would have been better if the would have managed to balance the characters traits better,black_comedy
this movie didnt resonate with meas charming as pegg and frost with their magnificent chemistry this does not equal comedy and i feel a bit embarassed watching themthe zombie aspect when it finally comes is pretty brutal all the more so for its comic timing and quite welcome since until that point it is a pretty generic piece of relationship drama where pegg just keeps getting it wrongbut i there really arent any jokes i like dark humour but thats more than dark stuff with a pop music soundtrack its not really dark comedy its more like heres something macabre presented flippantly you can laugh now family guy knows how to make things you shouldnt joke about seem like the funniest thing ever its because they make it into a joke rather than trusting transgressive themes are the joke the movie seems somewhat lazy in that regardthe romantic interest is also pretty blandthe movie does not skimp on the gore though make and direction really came through on thata lot of people love this but i think a lot of it is just because it was fresh for its time,black_comedy
the first time i watched this movie  the first of hundreds of viewings mind you  i realized this was made by people who love zombie movies as much as i do now the intervening years may have diminished my zombie adoration but i still love this film it takes what most of the cast had been doing on the bbc show spaced particularly the art episode and truly takes it to the next levelshaun works in an electronics store named for dawn of the dead star ken foree with a really bad life to be honest he has family issues girlfriend issues roommate issues work issues  man he has issues when he wakes up to a zombie apocalypse however he finally finds purpose in lifethe storyline is simple but the film is anything but ive always been struck by how much emotion this wrings out  shaun finally connecting with his stepfather phillip the always great bill nighy moments before he dies and comes back from the dead the final talk between our hero and his mother and how the ending keeps status quo while allowing shaun to claim a new life alongside the woman he lovesno less of a zombie luminary than george romero loved this movie in fact he invited pegg and wright to appear in 2005s land of the dead however the duo insisted on being zombies rather than the human roles they were offeredmy favorite scene in the film is when shaun and his friend potentially exgirlfriend yvonne and her friends as theyre both on the run beyond their friends being mirror images of one another theyre also famous british couples simon pegg and jessica hynes were tim and daisy from spaced lucy davis and martin freeman were dawn and tim from the british version of the office dylan moran and tamsin greig were bernard and fran from black books julia deakin and nick frost were also in spacedthere are a ton of zombie movie references here like an italian place named fulcis the winchester bar having a winchester model 66 the same gun from night of the living dead a restaurant named bubs pizza after bub from day of the dead an employee named ash is mentioned in shauns speech in the beginning referencing evil dead the song on the bus is kernkraft 400 by zombie nation plus theres debate as to what to call the zombies as many modern films refer to them as infected instead of the actual word and of course ed shouting were coming to get you barbara comes directly from the movie that this all comes from night of the living deadeven though this film is nearly 15 years old it hasnt aged in my eyes but im biased  i loved spaced as well as the two films that follow this hot fuzz and the worlds end even if you dont love gore and zombies there is still plenty of heart that youll enjoy in this film,black_comedy
i was looking to watch some nice comedy flick over the weekend did some research and finalized on this one imdb ratingcheck user reviewscheck and why didnt i filter on low ratings anyways so the movie is about sort of a loser professionally and romantically who is dumped by his girlfriend people in the office dont take him very highly he got flatmates one who doesnt work and plays games and there is another one who is serious about life our guy is obviously close to the gamer guy after heartbreak our guy and the dopergamer drink the entire night only to wake up next day hungover to find out people are turning to zombies and they need to save themselves before any zombie bites them so they kill a few zombies wandering around their house and get their mates car to save his mother and stepdad and then his girlfriend and her mates they head off to their favorite bar thinking it would be safe place but as expected isnt so and they are surrounded by zombies all around the loser becomes the leader movie is very light hearted but it is like usual crass comedies out there which have few scenes that may make you smirk but none of them actually making you lol and most of them making you meh there is no proper character development nothing convincing enough as to why the girlfriend dumps him and why he hates the stepdad and few other tits and bits movie is bland and absolutely flat or may be i never liked the british humour,black_comedy
edgar wright is great simon pegg is great the cornetto trilogy is great this movie is great thanks for coming to my ted talk,black_comedy
ok its a mess in a style the movie went through lots of overrated things and plots even the ending the story doesnt have basics or care about anything but gathering the scenes together with expected plots and modest screenplay with edgars fashion in direction good  but wouldnt rather see it again 610,black_comedy
the first movie i watched from this trilogy was the last one at the worlds end and i must say that this one is by far betteri am still yet to watch hot fuzz both simon and nick are doing their job better than ever in this hilarious survival ride showing their pros and negatives the only thing i did not expect was the fact that this movies are not directly related one to another  i expected them to be a direct sequel one to another but that is not the case here anyway be sure to watch them one after another as you will watch how the actors grow older without losing their sense for awesomeness and comical acting,black_comedy
shaun seorang pria biasa tinggal bersama dua orang temannya dia memiliki hubungan buruk dengan pacarnya hidupnya berubah ketika wabah zombie menyerang kota london shaun harus menyelamatkan ibu pacar dan temantemannya dari zombie pemakan daging,black_comedy
in it goes through 2 days of shaun rileys simon pegg mundane life going to work at foree electric visiting his mother barbara penelope wilton and his stepdad philip bill nighy spending time with his girlfriend liz kate ashfield his best friend ed nick frost and lizs friends david dylan morgan and dianne lucy davis all at once at the winchester this all changes one day when zombies walk the earth not that shaun notices at first but once he notices hes determined to save liz and his mother by fighting off the zombie hordes as best as he can throughout this film he finally grows up and accepts responsibility for his actions and learns to deal with problems on his ownthroughout the film shaun consistently shows that he has no experience accepting responsibility whether its taking liz on a date spending entire nights at the local pub the winchester or refusing to accept his stepfather as his real dad now shaun never grows up before the zombies arrive we slowly learn that he has never changed and most likely never willonce the zombies arrive however shaun has to take on responsibility in this life or death situation hes the only one who will take charge and try to save his friends this is similar to another simon peggedgar wright movie the worlds end where simon peggs character gary king has to realize that theres more to do beyond drinking and that he has to stand up to an evil force to save his friends lives he chooses to fight them rather than give in and be forced to be their slaves throughout he has to make more and more important life choices deciding between risking himself and saving others he has to learn to grow up for once in his life to make decisions and be ready to face the consequences when it comes down to it shaun makes decisions that are questionable but he learns to live with them and think critically about what to do something he has never done beforelighting is a large part of the film as it represents the fear shaun is experiencing during the scene yet he decides to face that fear to be able to save his friends the darkest scenes in terms of lighting are almost always in scenes where shaun has to make a terrible choice such as killing his mother or deciding to leave ed behind to be eaten by zombies so he can escape a repeated element always brought to light in the film is the color red while this obviously shows up a lot because of the blood from the zombies it also leaks from his pen and is prominent while he is at work the color foreshadows what is to come and that there will be much more red in the futureoverall is a simple story about a man who learns to grow up while fighting zombies forcing him to learn how to deal with an adult life and accept some responsibility,black_comedy
good film overall with a funny and interesting plot very talented people involved including the director very enjoyable comedy really liked it 810,black_comedy
edgar wrights first major feature film is despite the clear influences from other horror movies a brilliant standalone film which launched the careers of the director and two stars simon pegg and nick frost a great mix of comedy style and horror the relatively quick film is a joy to watch truly brilliant,black_comedy
for comedy month i wanted to watch this movie because a friend of mine said it was his favorite comedy the weird thing is that while this definitely made me laugh a lot it didnt seem like it was entirely a comedy there honestly were a lot of dramatic moments in this and they were done very well i cant really say it works better as a drama because its certainly hilarious i was impressed at how there were literally dozens of pop culture references in this i might have to see this movie again just to get all of them well its about this guy who after breaking up his girlfriend slowly realizes that zombies are taking over the town they dont have as good chemistry as in deadpool 2 but its still very fun to watch i love how he keeps telling people not to use the word zombie we seem to get some of our best material at the very end and beginning its a film that really does make you want to look around and notice everything i personally find zombieland to be better but this is great too 12,black_comedy
youll be alive with laughter glee and even some social commentary after watching,black_comedy
i own a copy of this film i enjoyed every movie edgar wright has directed except maybe baby driver and respect him as one but the problems ive experienced with the movie is just how bland it looks i felt like hot fuzz and the worlds end did it so much better but just the look kinda ruined it for me even then though everything else in this movie is solid the framing the transitions etc the writing  while god did feel like it needed some room to breath definitely a great movie though,black_comedy
this movie is pretty good its consistently funny the cinematography is fantastic the characters are entertaining and the story is clever the only thing thats holding this movie back is that at points it gets pretty boring in between jokes other than that which is to be fair a pretty small complaint as during the bits where nothing is happening there is a lot of amazing camerawork i would definitely recommend this movie,black_comedy
2004 is so beautifully layered and brilliantly constructed that its easily one of the most rewatchable films of all time each new viewing yielding new rewards in the form of clever nuggets of worldbuilding and jokes so subtle they had gone unnoticed before its also easily one of the funniest flicks ive ever seen along with its two icecream flavoured spiritual sequels while also being one of the smartest and most cinematic to boot the energetic editing is so distinct and confident that it can almost tell the story on its own and the masterful screenplay pulls all the right strings in all the right places to play its audience like a fiddle it will have them rolling on the floor one moment before wiping away a genuine tear the next the piece does all of this while perfectly parodying a playedout genre and feeling effortlessly fresh at the same time its an entirely unique piece of filmmaking that owes a debt to many films of the past but repays it in full just by being so utterly great 1010,black_comedy
i absolutely love the cornetto trilogy and is on the top of that trilogy i remember seeing ads for it and thought the film would be a bad spoof film along the lines of disaster movie this quickly became one of my favourite films and arguably the best in the zombie genre it also introduced to edgar wright who i think is a brilliant filmmaker i know it may be a trilogy but i hope pegg frost and wright have more films in them,black_comedy
is an absolute classic im reviewing this movie as someone who has seen it at best 10 times if not more over the years and that should be proof of how good it actually is admittedly this movie is much more appealing to a british audience since the british culture and humour may be difficult to understand or unfunny to nonbrits but for those that do get its wittiness and dark sense of humour its hilarious and unforgettable as a horror fan zombies and comedies are probably my two least favourite subgenres yet manages to combine the two in the most brilliant way the humour is consistent with simon pegg and nick frost being the perfect comedic duo to play best friends shaun and ed its clear to see that the two have a friendship offscreen that transitions onto screen and provides a very endearing and funny dynamic between them with most comedy horrors the humour falls flat for me but in despite it being delivered in many forms its always effective theres the traditional slapstick comedy with the tripping falling funny faces simon peggs excels in this theres comedy in the disaster of the characters and their numerous failings the dialogue is dripping with snappy oneliners that are subtle but funny and theres even humour in the repetitiveness and mundane nature of their lives which continues even amidst a zombie apocalypse theres the irony with lines such as youre dead and playonsforeshadowing of events to come with lines such as youve got red on you and the opening scene with everybody going about their lives like zombies these kind of subtleties are really what make the movie so genius despite the comedic nature theres also very serious scenes interwoven that evoke emotion and lead to reflection although fun is poked at the mess shauns life has become and death it knows when to draw the line and take a step back from the humour surprisingly the cast are just as capable of pulling off the more emotional scenes as they are the funny ones and towards the end there are some very heavy scenes that serve as a reminder that for the characters theyre very much living through this hell what makes so brilliant is that you can see every single detail from beginning to end has been well thought out and meticulously planned the ending beckons back to the beginning and throughout there are running gags or recurring themes or pieces of dialogue that really define the movie and make it distinctive the plot and events are foreshadowed or prophesied from the very beginning and everything comes together in a very cohesive way in my opinion is a classic in the horrorcomedy genre that although may not be everyones cup of tea has the perfect balance of comedy emotion and gore supported by a brilliant cast,black_comedy
waking up one seemingly normal morning an aimless slacker and his best friend find their london suburb overrun by flesheating zombies raised through unknown means forcing him and his friends to gather together and get them to safety away from the deadly creaturesthis turned out to be one of the most enjoyable zombie efforts ever among the numerous positives here is the absolutely hilarious and gutbusting comedy that comes from several really funny sources giving this some rather varied sources of comedy while there are some hysterical physical gags when they stumble over things tripandfall or just get bashed with objects all over the body theres a great deal of wordplay throughout that leaves this incredibly humorous especially with the way that a lot of these events are added alongside the absolutely clever manner this one undergoes towards lampooning and spoofing the genre the early repetition of the two days where they replicate the same story only with the zombies approaching on the second day inconspicuously the ability of the newreporter to give them the abilities needed to save themselves with their reports and the utterly creative and hilarious method of imitating the zombies to cross a massive swarm preventing them from getting to safety which all tends to turn traditional zombie fare into rather respective jokes and gags that is another enjoyable facet here where this one takes the whole manner of treating them so seriously that theres a great threat from the zombies where theyre absolutely considered a deadly serious threat that isnt made out to be a singular joke which makes this so fun by allowing these two factors to coexist together quite easily along with these the film also has a lot of fun here with the rather exciting and actionpacked encounters with the zombies which are spread throughout here as there are some utterly fun situations ere from their encounter in the garden debating what kind of vinyl records to use as ammunition the rescue of his parents as well as retrieving his girlfriend from the zombie hordes the absolutely crazy attacks as they attempt to get into the bar and the films finale where they are under siege in the bar from the numerous zombie hordes breaking through the barricades into an overall extended actionpacked flurry of bloodshed dynamic encounters and even a nice touch of pathos to make for some exemplary moments here together with the fantastic zombie makeup and great gore these here are enough to give this one some really enjoyable elements here against the one lone flaw here that comes from the rather lame way this one keeps pounding home his family strife letting it run for far too long turning it into overkill otherwise theres not much really wrong hererated r extreme graphic violence and extreme graphic language,black_comedy
was a comedy film that included elements of comedy and horror it followed two friends that were trying to get to a pub for shelter from a zombie apocalypse one of the friends shaun wants to also get his exgirlfriend to join them in the pub through misfortune and laughs the two friends fight through the zombie outbreak as well as dealing with issues of love family and of course friendship it used a lot fastpaced editing and was very gory it was quite funny and i found myself laughing often i cant really stomach gore very well but i was still able to watch this fine,black_comedy
2004 is a comical horror that should be the standard for this hybrid genre the film through the perspective of shaun played by simon pegg through his lackluster life that is beginning to fall apart while enduring an inevitable zombie apocalypse this film is riddled with comedy and a proper splash of gore the point of this film other than pure laughter is teaching the viewer to overcome obstacles which in this extreme zombie laden movie hits spot onthe director edgar wright is a comical genius delivering films such as hot fuzz scott pilgrim vs the world and the worlds end he provides lessons in his film aside from the comedy and despite the gore this film is his first major picture and it hit the mark the editing and music helped to keep viewers locked in on the important moments in the film overall this movie is a must watch for viewers who enjoy a good comedy and gore,black_comedy
im reading reviews and trying to find golden middle with no success audience considers this movie either the best or the worst british movie of the year british have an unusual and for the rest of us often incomprehensible sense of humor if youre used to hollywood this probably wont entertain you i suppose that most of the lowest ratings came from usa at the other hand i think this movie is overrated and that most of the tens that pulled it to an average of eight came largely from britain from my point of view this is solid movie for one watching i wouldnt call it a comedy it is horror adventure sprinkled with lots of humor british humor that tries not to be too british but to adapt to the wider audience and in that attempt lies its biggest issue also it is very difficult to mix genres especially if theres too many although this movie somewhat succeeds in that attempt it didnt quite shine still we have to acknowledge this brave attempt to make something unusual all together if youre not a fan of recent british film dont even give it a try but if you are able to slip into british state of mind i think youll enjoy this flick i surely did710,black_comedy
a great romantic comedy with zombies edgar wright really knows how to use visual comedy and thats what makes this film so spectacular,black_comedy

is one of only a handful of films where no matter how far it is into its runtime if i see it on tv ill stop what im doing and watch it until its credits this is one of the funniest films ive ever seen and one that gets better upon repeat viewings its an incredibly fun film that is endlessly quotable edgar wright directs this film with a high level of energy and stylish panache has one of the best scripts written for a comedy it rivals classics like young frankenstein its one of the most thought out intelligent genre comedies aroundsimon pegg plays your average everyman shaun shaun is lazy carefree and floating through life like a figurative zombie hes someone thats constantly taking the easy option much to the annoyance of his girlfriend lizkate ashfield so when a zombie outbreak occurs shaun and his equally oafish roommate ednick frost are completely oblivious to the chaos encompassing themthis leads to some truly hilarious situations suchas when shaun is walking to his local convince store hes completely disconnected on his everyday route to the local convenience shop he ignores a crashed car a woman running away an approaching zombie that he assumes is a beggar wanting change even when he slips on a pool of blood hes not attune to his surroundings being an edgar wright film there are tons of visual gags and easter eggs that accompany the situation and the film as a whole this makes rewatching the film just as fun and engaging as the first time if not moresotheres even interesting social commentary to be gained from the film as well much like george a romeros dead trilogy it looks at how oblivious society has become and how mundane our daily lives are that not only does a zombie apocalypse come and go without any notice being taken but also how much real people act like zombies doing the same jobs and tasks day after day becoming increasingly disconnected with society and each other whilst this aspect is explored in greater detail in romeros dead films theres still a healthy serving of satire in this film to be gained the fact that wright can extract gags from some of the most mundane scenarios like a pen leaking on a shirt is a testament to his wonderfully creative writing and directing skillshowever once shaun and ed come to realise the situation theyre in the film really kicks into gear after shaun and ed fend off an assault from two zombies in hysterical fashion by sorting through their unwanted vinyl records and trying to lob them at their heads though when that failed they have to resort to a spade and a cricket bat they then devise a plan to take shauns mum and his girlfriend liz aswell as her two roommates and hideout at their local pub in shauns words go to the winchester have a pint and wait for all this to blow overnaturally during the course of the film things dont go smoothly and despite being a comedy it is after all a zombie film there are moments with lots of gore aswell as brilliantly timed zombie kills to the beat of queens  dont stop me now manages to converge these two tones and deliver one of the best genre mash ups of alltimewas my first exposure to the incredible talent that is edgar wright his writing and directing and especially the way his films are edited to the beat of a drum show how confident and creative of a director that he is despite this being his debut filmno im not counting a fistful of fingers he is like a puppet master that is in full control of every frame i cant find a bad word to say about for me this is the pinnacle of comedic filmmaking,black_comedy
review directed by edgar wright is a loose parody of dawn of the dead although the similarities are just the name and the zombies it is the first film of the cornetto trilogy starring simon pegg and nick frost it is a zombie comedyhorror romance film and is in my opinion the best of the cornetto trilogy films released in 2004 it is about a man who decides to turn his life around and get back with his exgirlfriend reconciling with his mam and dealing with an entire community which has turned into zombies shaun played by simon peg is a pretty average person he works in a television sales shop one day he decides to win his exback and make up with his mam and his stepdad all the while a zombie apocalypse is going on one thing this film does well is it picks and chooses what type of genre it want to be in different scenes one minute its horror than its comedy then drama then a bit of romance and sometimes a mix of all thats what this film does best and what makes it so good one of the standout scenes in the whole film is when shaun walks to the shop for the second time the first time he goes at the start of the film it cements what a loser he is but the second time it is pretty funny he groggily walks to the shop and as hes just out of bed hes not fully awake and doesnt notice what is happening around him zombies are all around him and he hasnt a clue it is hilarious it is a very well shot scene and sets up the humour side of the film what i liked about this film as well is that it had a relatively low budget and the special effects still hold up today the goriest scene in the film is when a man is ripped apart and it holds up today there is no cgi used and i appreciate that the practical effects are spot on another great thing about the cornetto trilogy not just is the relationship on screen between simon pegg and nick frost they work very well together playing off one another the script is very funny and well written by edgar right and simon pegg the camaraderie between characters especially shaun and ed also with their other housemate pete finally the ending is very funny and without giving too much away i could see the commercialization of zombies if there ever was an apocalypse in conclusion is a very well written exciting witty gory fun film the acting writing and visuals are great if you liked it i would wholeheartedly recommend seeing the rest of the collaborations between simon pegg and nick frost all in all i give it a 910 its a must see,black_comedy
appearing from out of the blue this is a reminder of the good things that british cinema has to offer a great caste a cracking laughaminute script and a distinctively british twist on the oldfashioned zombie proceedings make this one to watch it works brilliantly as a comedy with tons of laughs the dart in the head scene is still my favourite and plenty of witty repartee as a zombie film its also cool what with social referencing sometimes astonishing scenes of gore weve got people being impaled beaten and in one outstanding moment dylan moran getting his guts torn out and his legs torn off and loads and loads of suspense and action ive never seen anything quite like itsimon pegg is the star and his crew from spaced do most of the work behind the scenes pegg who id never watched before is great with his typical everyday looks and impeccable timing his brutish friend ed as played by the strangely familiar nick frost steals every moment hes on screen proving to be the better than johnny vegas the supporting cast of seemingly every british tv comedian in existence is also fine  with penelope wilton and bill nighy as peggs parents particularly good the film is chockfull of references even the precredits production titles have the music from dawn of the dead on them there are plenty more scenes that youll miss but that repeat viewing will show the reason the film is so successful is because of the originality okay so the overall plot is familiar but the individual jokes humour and physicality of it pay off in dividends the ending is a little too dark in places but nevertheless the films winning streak of black comedy makes it worthwhile okay so i still dont know if dogs can look up but watching this film is a fine and fun experience,black_comedy
billed as a romantic comedy with zombies is a smart funny british comedy starring geek icons simon pegg and nick frost the first part in the blood and ice cream trilogy the spiritual successors being hot fuzz and the worlds end the story concerns the titular shaun who is every bit the everyman hero he likes to spend his evenings in his local pub the winchester with his best mate ed and his girlfriend liz unfortunately liz wants more from life and dumps our hero then one drunken night he decides that he is going to get his life back on track unfortunately for shaun the dead start to rise from their graves so we have a sharply written relationship comedy against the backdrop of a full on zombie infestation the jokes are good and the action sequences have a gritty feeling that they are routed in realism rather than overblown hollywood shtick the film lovingly references such grates as dawn of the dead and night of the living dead but the references are all subtle blinkandyoullmissit ones like the rifle they use in the winchester is naturally a winchester model 73 the same weapon used in both versions of night of the living dead and during the scene in which ed nick frost yells into the phone were coming to get you barbara is a direct lift from night of the living dead 1968 its a film that has aged well the effects still look current and by keeping pop cutler references so subtle it doesnt feel like a film that is eleven years old part of the reason it still looks good is that they used real squibs rather than digital ones real blood squibs always look better you actually care about shaun and his life despite the fact that on the surface he is such a loser it feels like he is a real person and not a tired caricature of a loser even the ridiculous setting a zombie epidemic feels real and the way that the characters react to the situation are realistic theres no silly out of character moments and the whole movie flows wonderfully its a clich to call it a nonstopthrillride but it is simply a wellmade well shot and well written film that keeps throwing jokes awesome character pieces and even the odd heart breaking moment at you in short the film dose everything right and very little wrong if i had to find fault with the film it would be that some of the jokes are a bit subtle on the first viewing but that is hardly a fault as the more times you watch the film the more you will get from it,black_comedy
very funny pegg and frost vehicle spoofing zombie films actually quite a long time before the whole twilight thing got underway not to mention the subgenre of historical characters like abraham lincoln combating the undead when not fighting a civil war and abolishing slaveryif anything i found there were probably too many zombies on display leading to lots of time taken up battering skewering and shooting hordes of them which to my mind got in the way a little of the very funny humour elsewhere sure frost and pegg are just another set of men behaving badly frost the lazy slobbish leech and pegg the bright blokey nerd but they play off each other so well that ill forgive the stereotypesthe gags come thick and fast with runninggags aplenty youve got red on you im sorry shaun and more sight and slapstickgags and lots of local humour to relate to especially if youre born in the uk i found very few of the jokes obviously telegraphed instead finding the humour and general observation both fresh and funny my favourite gag probably the deciding of which records to aim at the zombies  purple rain  no sign of the times  definitely not batman soundtrack  send itdirector edgar wright does so briskly especially with those now familiar fastcut edits to speed along a scene or a joke theres good support by all but principally from bill nighy as shauns standoffish stepdad and lucy smith as shauns girlfriends girlfriendall in all just a very funny if fakegoreloving comedy which rather like the zombies in the movie id happily jump back up again to rewatch any future chance i get,black_comedy
many a film  and in particular zombie film  seems to be based on a pun flight of the living dead im looking at you however few actually exhibit enough originality to be worthy of the film theyre based on shaun changes all that in 2004 zombies were still relatively uncommon on the cinema screen you had the resident evil films and that was about it therefore being dumped by ones girlfriend on the same day the dead come back to life and start eating the living was definitely something a bit different back thenits fair to say that is a classic since its release its been imitated plenty of times and none of them have really done as well the fact is that shaun is just damn funny while at the same time being pretty horrific when it tries and even touching and sentimental when the mood takes it therefore despite largely being lumped into the horror genre its appeal actually stretches much further to those looking for a good comedy or even a date movie to share with someonesimon pegg plays not exactly a loser but certainly an underachiever his titular character shaun is generally coasting through life never really applying himself all he wants to do is hang out at the local pub with his mate ed who definitely is a loser its no wonder his girlfriend liz is getting more than a little sick of his lack of drive however that all changes when the dead rise from the grave and he hatches a plan to save those he loves and even a few of those he doesnt  lizs flatmate to be precisewhat follows is a jaunt across a zombieinfested london as they desperately try to get to safety and in shauns mind safety equals the local pub where he spends pretty much all his life what works best about the film is the way the characters play off each other theyre pretty much all friends in real life check out some of the other films and tv theyve been in therefore theyre all used to working with each other and more importantly playing off each other you really get the impression that they really are a bunch of friends caught up in a life or death situationbottom line if you like horror youll like this if you like comedy youll still like it and in case youre wondering what the cornetto reference is in the title  this happens to be the first film in the fabled cornetto trilogy simon pegg wrote the film with his friend and director edgar wright together they wrote a further two films all subtly working in a nice ice cream into the mix if you like try hot fuzz comedy and action and the worlds end comedy and scifi all the time watching out for the cornetto reference,black_comedy
this is one movie which mixes two genres which i dont like  horror comedy and zombie but where it succeeds is the fact that horror is not really a factor in this it is not really a horror comedy it is just a straight forward comedy that makes it better than the numerous ridiculous horror comedies that are coming out every year from the usa which has patented the genre i think dont expect any sort of suspense or creepy moments in this one but the movie is so full of action it doesnt really matter certain characters were a little annoying for me especially david who was getting on my nerves a bit i dont think ed was too likable either he created more problems with his impressive size he could have been a useful asset to the groupthe movie takes its time to get going and spends time in establishing the characters and the situations but once it gets into gear it really doesnt let up till the end there were quite a few ridiculous moments and obviously many zombie movie conventions were made fun of including the use or misuse of guns if you actually think about it zombies are not as big a threat in small numbers because they move slow and are not intelligent i guess their advantage is that nobody believes in zombies and they spring upon you without any warning and by the time everybody realizes that zombies exist many people are already infected it helps to watch the movie with subtitles because the funny lines are spit out quick and with the accent it was slightly hard one of the best scenes was the one where they were throwing the records at the zombies the dialogue is pretty funny in that scene it has a light tone throughout and that is reflected in the ending as well as of now this is my favourite zombie themed film i preferred this movie to hot fuzz i got a headache watching that film so i guess it may be a good decision to check out the worlds end as well710,black_comedy
has some great cemical moments and yet it has been made with lots of professionalism like this was a serious gory horror movie they were making this film should be seen side by side with romeros dawn of the dead as both film cleverly and sarcastically comment on our zombie society and virtually show no difference between the living and the living dead of course not everything goes as smoothly as planned theres undead flatmates to deal withbitoy zombies along the way petty arguments between friends and eds cell phone going off at inopportune moments but shaun arrived with a cricketbat is determined to save the women loves and nothing is going to get in his way,black_comedy
is a smart funny homage to zombie movies while also maintaining its own identity instead of relying entirely on genre clichs this film marked the first theatrical collaboration between simon pegg nick frost and director edgar wright and is a mostly solid affair the performances and directing are all handled well but it wasnt as laughoutloud funny as i was expecting maybe its because british humor isnt something i 100 get still i thought that the gore was welldone tension was kept up and the characters were all likable enough that i cared what happened to them for me the best moments were the quieter situational humor rather than the gory kills that one would expect from such a horrorcomedy overall its one of the better horrorcomedies to come out in the last 10 years and should provide enough thrills and laughs for genre fans,black_comedy
is the best zombie movie ive seen in a long time i enjoyed the movie a lotsee this film you do not have to be a fan of horror movies to appreciate the sublime satire that is i havent seen a movie this good for a very long timeit was hilariousclever and sweet i guarantee any viewers out there that youll spend more time laughing than you will being frighted i am a big fan of simon and nick and this was best in trilogy every actor is very good the plan scene was very good this was best comedy movie i have ever seen wright and simon have written an entertaining movie i am sure that you will enjoy this movie 9 stars,black_comedy
edgar wrights is a british horrorcomedy inspired in part by zombie movies like george romeros dawn of the dead the story surrounds a pair of twentysomething underachievers who find themselves in the middle of a zombie crisis for the titular shaun the situation becomes a catalyst for getting his life back on trackone of the things that i really appreciated about this movie in the early going was the deft juxtaposition of comedy and horror the title character has an inkling that something odd is going on but things have already progressed quite a bit before he finally gets wise the direction is particularly interesting during this stage because we see several stock horror shots recycled in a clever waycomedy is just one of the weapons in the films arsenal though when things start getting horrific there are some tense moments though still tempered with a sense of humour the film also has some surprisingly heartfelt emotional content as well clearly the brains behind the script were much more thoughtful than most horror writersspeaking of which wright cowrote the script with star simon pegg peggs performance in the lead role propels the film and his pairing with nick frost provides many of the films finest comedic moments meanwhile bill nighy makes a welcome appearance in a small role and the remainder of the core group of supporting players complements the central pair nicelyin the end is a film that should be essential viewing for both horror and comedy fans since its not too scary to be funny and its not too funny to be scary and if youre wondering how gory the film is its not bad granted there is one scene where a fellow gets ripped limb from limb but apart from that its fairly tame,black_comedy

at least here in britain this film is seen as a coming of age film meaning if you havent seen this film you cant really comment on zombie films this film sees shaun a guy contempt with his boring average life going to the pub with his beat friend ed however when a zombie apocalypse hits town shaun ed and a few others must attempt to survive in their favourite pub the winchester now i believe simon pegg is a great comedic actor and in this film he truly proves it he is the perfect person to play shaun he is funny he is relatable and sometimes heroic and exactly what a film like this truly needs nick frost is hear as usual as his best friend ed and he also does a really good job obviously the chemistry between pegg and frost is insane and it truly carries the film i thought the actress who played shauns girlfriend did a good job as well with some really good dialogue but the rest of the characters were pretty paper thin and not interesting at all now this is your typical zombie apocalypse but it does have a good story of a character who is down and average rise up and become a hero and i liked it a lot also i liked the way that the story made out that the zombies represent every day life and that was a good stylistic option there is some plot points just shoehorned into the film but i forgave this because of the overall story with shaun the script is just excellent with the dialogue being really quick and snappy and also the jokes didnt feel forced and they flowed incredibly well into the narrative where there was a few heartfelt moments obviously to me the style is really cool as the film is completely british and i liked the setting and also the way the zombies acted was cool overall i think is fantastic and it should be seen by all,black_comedy
shaun simon pegg leads a dull life as a salesman at an electronic store he is mocked by everyone around him and his girlfriend dumps him but his life takes turn when a zombie invasion happens he is spurred into action to protect his loved ones winning back their affection and respect in the processit is a spoof of the zombie movies by george a romero but also has an original story of its own there is plenty for both comedy and horror fans the atmosphere is tense the scares are genuine and the movie does not cut back on gore and yet every moment of it is funny for example there is a scene where shaun and his gang move through a street full of zombies by pretending to be one of them it is a cheeky idea and it is fun to watch them do that but the danger of being discovered is kept realpegg is the life of the movie he perfectly brings out both the seriousness and the silliness of the movie at the same time the cornetto trilogy is one of the finest british comedies alongside ealing comedies and the monty python films and this movie is the perfect beginning to the trilogy,black_comedy

most likely but they cant deliver a punchline to save their lives i enjoyed this movie but its no oscar contender this was my first simon pegg movie if you dont count the star trek films pitting two losers against the zombie apocalypse was an enjoyable premise and they pulled if off pretty well this isnt an end of the world kind of zombie film more a there goes the neighborhood type that changes the characters lives but doesnt have any real world impact at the end the zombies were nearly walking dead caliber in realism got a little serious at the end but its death after all couldve been a lot funnier if i was drinking but overall a fun film perhaps a light second act sandwiched between 28 days later and 28 weeks later in a zombie marathon,black_comedy
most of this movie takes place in a pub all the people in it are british it even has martin freeman in it thats how british it is is more comedy than horror and plays on its earlier peers its a prerequisite to know your basic zombie apocalypse movies when watching this the films strength is in its believability  these characters totally know what zombies are and act accordingly when someone makes a stupid mistake the others are quick to call it outcompared to something like zombieland shaun is less serious and more whimsical and based on sketches the ending is cool and surprising and something id like to see explored in other serious zombie stories,black_comedy

were coming to get you barbarais one of those films that benefited from the release date since a few weeks earlier the zombie horror flick dawn of the dead hit theaters worldwide a couple of years before that danny boyle scared audiences in england with his successful zombie flick 28 days later works as a spoof to all zombie movies so the distributors had perfect timing which is essential for a comedy the film also had a pretty strong fan base considering simon pegg and nick frost had worked with director edgar wright in the past in the tv series spaced the setting for this film was just perfect and wright and pegg did a great job with the script thanks to we got to see these actors team up together for another great film hot fuzz a spoof on pretty much all the 90s action movies and for the upcoming the worlds end which is receiving great reviews from critics fans of the tv series spaced might enjoy some inside references in but regardless of whether or not youve seen it you will still have a great time with this film because the script is witty and clever while the performances are also all pretty strong the more zombie movies youve seen the more you will enjoy this because it makes fun of several of those generic stereotypes i wouldnt say this is a horror flick because there isnt really a scary moment but it is an intelligent comedy that makes fun of those cheesy moments in horror films jump scenes where one person shows up all of a sudden with creepy music in the background is worth your time if you are looking for a good and fun timeshaun simon pegg is kind of a slacker who hasnt done much with his life he is content to spend his days with his roommate ed nick frost and his girlfriend liz kate ashfield hanging out at the local pub where he is a frequent customer the problem is that liz is tired of the relationship since all they do is hang out with ed at the pub and she barely gets to have time alone with him shaun promises to take her out to a nice restaurant and turn his life around but the next day he gets distracted by a visit from his stepdad bill nighy who reminds him he has to go visit his mother penelope wilton thus forgetting to reserve a table for dinner with his girlfriend tired of shauns broken promises liz decides to break up with him shaun realizes its time to turn his life around but something strange is happening in his town all of a sudden dead people are coming back to life and attacking everyone so shaun realizes this is the perfect opportunity to prove to liz that he is capable of saving and protecting her from the deadly zombie attacksworks really well thanks to the great chemistry between simon pegg and nick frost you can tell their friendship transcends the big screen and seeing them pair up is what works best in this film the british gags and cultural references cross borders and the jokes are effective anywhere this is one film anyone can enjoy because it works on its own it isnt one of those spoof films which you can only enjoy if youve seen the movie its making fun of the fun and the jokes work on their own and the relationship between the characters is also really strong came to my attention when quentin tarantino shared his list of the 20 best films of the last 20 years and this movie appeared on that list i really enjoyed this movie but i dont consider it among the best comedies of our era in my opinion hot fuzz was even funnier but i really look forward to the worlds end which looks really promising is worth checking out if you are one of the few people that havent seen it,black_comedy
is a brilliant movie with a fantastic storyline and a surprisingly impressive comedic castit is simon pegg and nick frosts first movie and they give a very good first impressiontheir characters were both hilarious in this movie and they were also very impressive as actorsi was also very impressed with lucy davisi didnt think she would be able to deliver a performance like she did in thisbecause i only knew her from the officethe movie is said to be a romantic horror comedybut i would only count it as a comedythe zombies are more funny than scary and the romance isnt very intenseits more comedicfans of british comedies like spacedwill definitely lovewhen his town has turned into zombiesshaun simon pegg does his best to protect his exgirlfriendhis mother and his best friendwhile trying to make it to his favourite pub,black_comedy
well for starters simon pegg is an amazing actor which makes the film even better and their all very realistic actors i love the story line and the way it is directored and seriously you havent lived until you have watched this film the way the characters act towards the situation is very realistic just like how normal everyday people would act if this actually happened it is a great comedy the acting the speech and the body language are very funny in places and very amusing the fact that its on the news makes it feel like its real life and peoples immediate reaction in that situation they act like they cant believe whats happening but theres also a funny side to everything that happens i would recommend anybody if youre into zombie films to watch this unique film it is thought through well and every actor and actress has put all their effort and thoughts into it,black_comedy
back in 2004 simon pegg and edgar wright gave us a zombie classic it was a different pace than other recent zombie flicks dawn of the dead 28 days later as it was a comedy pegg a well known british actor spaced many british television shows and wright a writer director whose first big hit would be thisand they delivershaun is a furniture salesmen who participates in the same boring schedule everyday he has problems with his mother penelope wilton and his girlfriend kate ashfield he is thrust into the zombie apocalypse and needs to band together with his best friend ed nick frost liz his girlfriend his mother and his girlfriends flatmates in order to make it to their favourite place in the world the winchester pub in hopes of waiting the whole thing offthis is pegg and wrights first film together and their script is very witty and humorous but knows where it stands as a zombie film its a completely different take on the zombie apocalypse showing that even if the entire world is falling apart you can still drink and laugh to your hearts contentthe duos first crack at a film together is astounding and spawned the blood and ice cream or three flavours cornetto trilogy which also contains hot fuzz and the upcoming film the worlds endis a truly wonderful film giving great performances laughs and zombie slaughtering throughoutand it shows us the meaning of friendship family and that you need to remove the head or destroy the brain in order to surviveeveryone should experience this film at one time or another i know i will be experiencing it again soon910,black_comedy
the other day i watched this all the way through for the first time in a while nonstop throwback horror movie references and plenty of injokes make this one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time wrights style is great i love the use of jump cuts and quick zooms to almost mock the jump scare tactic of normal horror or zombie films its a style he would go on to perfect in hot fuzz and the soon to be released trilogy ending the worlds end the film is acted perfectly by pegg and frost as well as the smaller roles especially those played by nighy penelope wilton and dylan moran i think the only thing bad i could pick out was the pace i think around the late 2ndearly 3rd act the film starts to drag a bit other than that though a fantastic comedy with plenty of brains and plenty of zombies to eat them,black_comedy
what a brilliant film i thought it was great the great mix of comedy horror and over the top gore filled me with joy the casting is great simon pegg always great nick frost adds lightheartedness to a serious film bill nighy although his part was small every line he said sounded like genius and they all made me chuckle it all seems to work when you look closely you can spot things characters places that appear later on in the film some parts of this film will have you on the edge of your seat biting your nails but then youll find that in the next minute youll be laughing at a funny comment that one of the hilarious actors has blurted out a must see for people who like action being scared laughing your head off and dont mind an extortionate amount of strong language,black_comedy
definitely one of the greatest comedy films out there as well as a brilliant representation of an undead outbreak in london made by two of the best british filmmaking minds out there simon pegg and edgar wright with its witty humour and clever use of horror it appeals to an audience after an alternative take on the comedy genrei wouldnt go as far as to say its the best film ever just kidding of course i would it provides a good laugh with a mixture of drama between shaun liz and other characters while allowing the audience to connect with these characters and watch them in their most vulnerable state a world surrounded in death and violence where losing your loved ones becomes virtually inevitable  a surprisingly difficult role to act out while maintaining hilarity in the events shows american film makers that the british know a thing or two as well and im certainly one for disproving american beliefs about usto summarise watch this film its bloody good,black_comedy
a truly brilliant horrorcomedy which gets it right on every level both funny touching and with plenty of horror moments this film has it allthe film boasts an excellent british cast with standout performances from simon pegg and nick frost as the main protagonists and penelope wilton and bill nighy as shauns mom and step dadthe film boasts several memorable scenes but in truth barely a scene is wasted the true test of a film is whether it repays repeated viewings and on this point the film really excels i have seen this film on a number of occasions and pick up something new each timethe film is very british and the extreme bad language throughout may put some people off and the ending could have been slightly stronger but other than that i really cannot fault this filmhighly recommended,black_comedy
hmm where to begin well it is a horror movie spoof  of the zombie sort  with clever comedic moments and a solid storylineplot its not very scary at allshaun is a decent guy that you want to root for his buddy ed is an idiot so you end up liking him too shauns romantic interest liz is a good gal as well so you end up rooting for her finally this is a love story and as a viewer you want the 3year love affair between shaun and liz to work out their relationship is on the fritzso allinall id say give this movie a shot theres comedy likable characters love and a few zombies to boot,black_comedy
having enjoyed the television series spaced i was keen to see this film as it features many of the same creators here simon pegg plays the eponymous shaun a salesman in a dead end job who lives with his best mate ed who just lazes around playing video games all day before spending the evenings down the pub with shaun shauns girlfriend liz and her friends dianne and david his life is so mundane that he doesnt notice that the streets are slowly filling with the walking dead when he finally does notice he decides that he and ed must go and rescue his mother and his now exgirlfriend and seek sanctuary in the winchester things are complicated by the fact that his step father has been bitten and the area around the pub is crawling with the living dead while this is primarily a comedy there should be enough gore to please horror fans in fact i suspect they will enjoy the comedy more too as they will spot references that those not familiar with the classics of the zombie genre like me will miss the story is pretty basic but that doesnt matter extra subplots would just have been a distraction the acting was pretty solid simon pegg was ideal as shaun and penelope wilton and bill nighy were great as his mother and step father both providing some surprisingly emotional scenes for a film of this type there is a fair amount of gore once or twice things get extremely gory however it isnt really dwelt on too much fans of spaced will be pleased to see jessica hynes even though her role is much smaller here if you are in the mood for a horror film but also want a good laugh then this could be just the film you are looking for,black_comedy
i will be very short with this zombedy the way it was edited was really well done the zombies looked believable the acting was okay and the humor in it was excellent i did have a few loud laughs just watch how they used dont stop me now from queen when they are hitting a zombie or when they meet another bunch of people that have survived or when shaun is walking towards a shop its also funny to see how coldplay was involved in this project back then in 2004 they werent the mega seller they are nowadays the effects on the other hand were excellent just see how one zombie got a whole in her stomach and not only the humor was okay but the gore staid intact too there are a few better comedies out there but this one worked on all kind script makeup effects and especially the editing the two main leads nick frost and simon pegg went further as the thomson twins in tintin by steven spielberg surely on to see if you want to have some fungore 35 nudity 05 effects 45 story 45 comedy 35,black_comedy
so i had seen beforebut it was always scattered scenes of it today i finally saw it in its entirety and it is a very funny film the satire in it is great and the way the dead is not just referring to the obvious zombies but also to the world shaun himself lived in is great i do feel that it becomes a little tired in its last act and i do think zombieland is the better comedy zombie film however this has the better performances and the character of ed is always pretty damn entertaining i just wish the film hadnt lost the same spark it had in the beginning overall its very funny and definitely recommended for horror fans and anyone at that,black_comedy
this is a wild film which carries comedy into realms of anarchy hitherto undreamedof the humour is very british and many of the characters are slobs of a type only found in britain it is not that other countries do not have slobs but british slobs are strangely different from say american slobs this film sheds a great deal of light on slobology and the variants of slobs which occur in britain which have never been the subject of sufficient academic study one would think that the armies of sociologists marching into a glorious future intended to be ruled by automatonlike regulators who will determine our every move in our daily lives would have turned their attentions towards slobology but this seems to have eluded them in their zeal to oppress people who are not slobs indeed it is even possible that the sociologists and their disciples the social workers are themselves closet slobs who are afraid of coming out but simon pegg is not afraid of coming out indeed he is not afraid of anything even crowds of murderous zombies the film works because of the marvellous comic abilities of simon pegg around whom the entire phantasmagoria of the story evolves much of the film takes place with the few sane slobs left in the country pegg and his girl friend surrounded by hordes of dead people who have come back to life and wish to bite living people infect them with their virus and turn them into zombies like themselves this film is thus a kind of insanely funny homage to the original invasion of the body snatchers 1956 the classic psychological horror film from which the world never recovered and which touched the ultimate nerve of our insecurities there is no way to purge fear better than by laughter and mocking the zombies in this outrageous farce is a good way to lay them to rest at least temporarily there are deep psychological reasons why this film was so successful which go beyond its anarchic humour and zestful production pegg is also an excellent everyman in that he is totally immune to recognition of his own faults and who does that remind us of pegg is also not afraid to look ridiculous all of us are ridiculous but most of us do not wish to appear so pegg is thus a kind of miraculous superslob someone so clueless but possessing an intermittent animal cunning that he is echelons above the rest of us in both folly and survival capacity he is thus very like a kings fool in a mediaeval royal court as he wades calmly through seas of threatening zombies batting them with his cricket bat and bashing in their skulls the only way to destroy a zombie so we are told by reallife british television presenters used in the film is to destroy the brain which has been infected for nothing else can kill them pegg is simultaneously heroic and idiotic he is heroic without knowing it because he fights his way through the zombies without fear but he is an idiot because his only plan is to go to his favourite pub the winchester and take refuge there with a pint of beer imagining it must be safe from the zombies because that is where he always goes to relax and unwind so the film is really a celebration of idiocy done with good humour and affection the real reason why pegg does not feel fear is because he is too stupid to do so and the closest he comes to fear is a state of mindless apprehension and worry of the will i miss the train sort the film is thus in its wider sense a commentary on the whole of british society which in a state of apprehension stopping far short of fear because of mass stupidity is wading through the bankruptcies and financial contagion another form of zombieism towards economic doom and social collapse most british slobs depend on a mythical thing called the state to support them when the state can no longer do so and when the bailouts inevitably come to an end the slobs will then possibly become hordes of angry zombies thronging the streets as we see in this film and indeed as has just happened in all the riots in real life london which included slobs as young as eleven this film might thus be likened to the ancient biblical prophets in its warning that the zombies are coming or the end of the world is nigh or the end of croydon is nigh or whatever but then there is always the winchester and a couple of pints to save us the supporting cast and the direction of this film by edgar wright are all superb the script by pegg and wright is brilliant the film is a classic not just a cult classic but a real one and anyone who doesnt agree can have his head bashed in by a cricket bat,black_comedy

in my opinion apart from paul this is pegg and frosts best one i thought it had a good storyline and there were a lot of great actors i thought it was witty clever sharp the list goes on i was also glad that they kept the humour very british because thats what i love most about them i would stay away from this if you dont like excessive swearing most pegg and frost films are like that anyway however if its blood and guts your worried about dont be its all very comical and looks really fake overall i would say that is a very funny film with good actors i would rate it 8510 and say that it is suitable for anyone mature 13,black_comedy
i really really like nick frost simon pegg and edgar wrights films i loved hot fuzz the first time i saw it not as good second time but still i had heard from many that is actually even better and after finally seeing it i can say i agree not just better is one of the best comedies i have seen in quite some time its both very smart done and brilliantly funny it perfectly knows what to put the focus on the story is nothing that really matters much there is one but it serves only the purpose of holding it together still one never gets the feeling that it is to thin because you quickly into it get the picture that the story is not what will hold this up i love the kind of humor this film has but its not jokes and that kind of fun an example when some are sitting talking and all seems normal but then the camera slightly turns much of the humor works kind of like that first everything is normal and then quickly something unexpected and funny is revealed sometimes music is used brilliantly funny in the same way the film is violent but not as much as hot fuzz where i felt it became a bit overdrawn here its used just enough like the story its always over the top unrealistic and extremely funny to watch impressive how great characters they managed to create this being a comedy and not that long is not just a comedy like others well of course somethings are but this movie just makes every aspect massively better than the usual stuff just lean back and be just as entertained as impressed is brilliant and a pleasure to see,black_comedy
overall i enjoyed this movie and the british crack me up fairly well this movie delivers the zombie movie experience just like dawn of the dead in some terms there are break ups and sexual themed scenes in the movie this was personally the funniest movie i have ever seen the movie stars a sexy themed shaun as he fights his way through a major zombie apocalypse and the jokes prove to be unflat if you thought hot fuzz was incredibly stupid and funny you will be blown away by this inspirafull movie based on dawn of the dead i was so inspired by this movie that i had a dream of being a film director long after i saw this movie personally i think the lead character carries the film personally id give the movie a 99100 simon pegg youve done it again,black_comedy
what do you get when you put the apocalypse zombies and the chaotic duo of simon pegg and nick frost together you get a marvelously crafted written and acted comedy with everything thrown in troublesome parental relations a girlfriend whos drifting away idiotic and exasperating friends and of course a ton of zombies and simon pegg armed with a cricket bat to bash their heads in brilliantly written by both pegg and edgar wright it is the first and solid debut of three films that form the blood and ice cream trilogy hot fuzz the second film is even more hilarious and a mustwatchpegg plays shaun 29yearsold struggling to please his girlfriend and doesnt know what to do with his life frost plays his housemate ed who is just well crude the two find themselves awaking one morning to find the apocalypse at their doorstep or more specifically too many zombies wandering in the streets trying to eat people up shaun teams up with his friends and parents and decides to do something about it for once in his life so begins the mass killing of zombies accompanied by the audiences laughter the entire journeythis is a hilarious film and both pegg and wright have already established themselves among the best in comedic writing though there are those who dont find zombies as exciting the humour is enough to give it a watch the clever plays by the cast combined with the irresistible and gory bashing of zombies makes for a film that provides shaun with a new focus and meaning in life it doesnt quite contain deep and moral lessons for us but its entertaining and thats all that matters,black_comedy
filmmakers and writers simon pegg and edgar wright in tandem prove theyre more than adept at producing a high on energy levels high on laughs comedy material in their 2004 film their film is a big on fun big on smarts comedyromance piece about a clash of classes and a man going through somewhat of a midlife crisis just as the end of the world in the form of the dead coming back to life so as to feed on the living arrives into the world the film is a merciless series of rapid punchlines and injokes entertaining and effective in equal measure without ever feigning to be anything more a piece made by two people whom have here shown they have the comic timing and the subtly required to take on the kind of material they do take for instance the scene in which certain characters are trapped inside a locked car because the rear door childlocks are on it was established five minutes ago that they were on but such a gag works thanks largely to wright and peggs ability to introduce something place it on the backburner and then execute the joke when required to around all the other stuff in the form of character more immediate gags that are going on and great peril which is unfoldingone casts ones mind back to david zuckers 2003 film my bosss daughter a comedy free freak show whose comic timing awkwardly consisted of someone in ashthon kutcher inept and cackhanded placed in the delicate situation of looking after a pristine home and charged with looking after the pride and joy of its owner in the form of a pet owl the sounds of the gears of an automobile being incorrectly changed as it approaches a speed began to sound pretty early on sure enough everything goes down the pan in an as limp manner as possible in what was an excruciating feature the team on set a joke up mix it in with a couple of others have you momentarily misplace it before effortlessly executing the punchline minutes later amidst everything else thats happening in comparison it is a bravado display of both comic timing on top of entertaining material another example might be the anger levels reached by one character whose berating at others stems from the fact the front door is persistently being left open overnight the gag of which is set up placed on a backburner and then pulled off with aplomb when the time comesit is simon pegg playing the titular shaun a man in his late twenties working in a highstreet electronics store whilst supervising the more younger employees he lives with parttime drug dealer but the generally unemployed ed frost and whom were led to believe is a highflying businessman in pete serafinowicz both of whom shaun have known for many years shauns relationship with liz ashfield is on the rocks they sit in a public house named the winchester with some of her friends and discuss where they stand the pair of them clash in profile eds more centralised figure as he works a slot machine and spouts oneliners distracting us from what liz has to say she wants more out of life and wants a better relationship with shaun in which they do more together rather than just go to the pub the parallel between their disfigured connection to that of david moran and diannes davis lizs friends relationship is clear in that theirs is sturdier and have interests of a higher nature such as the going to theatres this is precisely where liz wishes to be in terms of status with shaun the earlier clash in profile has david and dianne sit on lizs side effectively a clashing of classes as shauns accomplice ed comes over and alienates everybody with his demeanourshaun and ed appear so tuned out of their lives that they appear to have missed the apocalypse two sequences that mirror one another show shaun in one long tracking shot walking from his home down the street and into a local shop before coming back again the items of a kid playing football a local washing his car and those in and around a local corner shop reoccur in both sequences the first time shaun ventures there everything appearing rosy and functioning in a supposedly utopian world of the working class and of terrace housing later on a similar sequence postepidemic is provided with the same route taken with similar elements along the way thus suggesting a link between the two existences or worlds shauns inability to tell the respective worlds apart is quite biting while the zombielike people plodding to work on board a bus very early on suggests alienation and disenchantment with their functioning lives an overlying sense of the western world in the form of seemingly happy kids playing football in the street amidst terrace housing and the working class and their cars already well on its way to ruinthe film scores points for moulding in the epidemic of the coming of the zombies with the drama going on between partners and housemates as well as it does this isnt a film as interested in delivering horror genre frills involving zombies as much as it is interested for the most part in dealing with character and story the film is effectively shauns shot at proving his worth to liz the winning of her back by way of proving his worth to her and ticking off all the more minor items which plagued the development of their relationship before specifically the inability to fabricate a meeting with shauns mother and the threat of competition from david whom it is established is attracted to liz the film is a really enjoyable expertly pitched piece full of heart and genuinely funny  the likes of which ought to be embraced,black_comedy
could be considered as a straight zombie film because it reunites all the elements it has plenty of brutal violence plenty of gore witty dialogs dynamic direction great characters and best of all neat fx thats all you need in these kind of flicksbut shaun takes it to a new direction and inserts black humor comedy and even spoofs the forementioned subgenrei dig the violence and brutality caused by the zombies we get violent wounds caused by guns beheadings etcthe plot is similar to night of the living dead obviously but is told in such a funny manner you cant help but enjoy british humori can safely say this is a straight horror movie with the right amount of black humor give it a try its an instant classic for those who are into zombie cinema,black_comedy
i love this movie so much before watching you have probably the wrong expectations going into it zombie films by nature are supposed to be intense and scary and while this movie does that it does so with hilarious comedy and a little bit of romance as the films tag line suggests along the way i think the humor in this film is what makes it accessible to both zombie fans and those unfamiliar with zombie culture alike shaun is a guy stuck in the middle of wanting to grow up and being loyal to his nice but completely immature friend when he loses his girlfriend shaun is dedicated to making a change in his life and stop living just barely getting by his motivation to change and get his girlfriend back along with the threat of thousands of zombies is what drives shaun to lead the others to safety shaun is met with obstacles along the way from his friends the zombies and himself shaun is faced with choices about loyalty and love and as a result he grows into the more mature but still fun person he longed to be from the beginning of the films charm is its quirkiness its a zombie film at heart but it has so many other elements to it that it can be enjoyed by both zombie fans and those who are new to the genre i would highly recommend it and who knows it may launch you into an affinity for zombie films it did so for me,black_comedy
does for zombie movies what hot fuzz did for cop films it wasnt quite as successful at it as the movie that would come afterwords but it was a fine way for simon and the gang to hone their craft in preparation for their epic buddy cop spoofthe entertainment value here comes from the humor and the characters and it succeeds in being better than many of the serious zombie movies that have been released in the last few years not much has to be changed in order from zombies to be transformed from horrifying to hilarious theres lots of injokes and foreshadowing that makes repeated viewings just as fun as the first trust me watching a zombie being rhythmically beaten to a queen song never gets old plus fans of the uk office get the pleasure of seeing lucy davis in a hilarious role and a few other welcome cameos add all that to the pleasure of getting to see simon pegg being simon pegg and what more could you want zombie fans will love this plain and simple ,black_comedy
having been derided by my mates down the pub for not having seen this one i decided it was time to bite the bullet now i have seen some of simon peggs more recent works hot fuzz 2007 was pretty good as was run fatboy run also 2007 and how to lose friends  alienate people 2008 hes now making the big bucks in america but i was quite interested to see how one of his earlier works turned outshaun lives with two flatmates ed and pete in london ed is always taking shaun down the local pub the winchester to the disgust of shauns girlfriend liz she and her friends dianne and david want shaun to break away from ed and straighten himself out unfortunately shaun is very attached to ed theyve known each other since they went to school together this comes to a head when liz dumps shaun and he ends up going out and getting drunk with ed as we see them going about their lives we get an inkling that something is not right people are starting to behave strangely the morning after it becomes apparent that something is seriously wrong news reports confirm that zombies are loose on the streets and its not safe out there shaun decides to go and rescue his mum barbara and his stepdad philip then go and get liz and then go to the pub so they have a plan but theres a lot of zombies out there there are a lot of pretty funny bits in this film i particularly liked the lp scene and the queen fight scene in the bar if youve seen the film youll know the ones i mean decent performances from all of the main cast simon pegg as shaun kate ashfield as liz nick frost as ed lucy davis as dianne and dylan moran as david honourable mentions also go to peter serafinowicz as pete bill nighy as philip and penelope wilton as barbaraso now we come to the nitty gritty did i enjoy it well it had parts that made me laugh but as a whole it didnt really bite me on the neck i found the character of ed really annoying hes stupid and very selfish yes he does have a couple of good oneliners but that doesnt make up for him being an idiot so over all its a pretty dumb comedy something to watch when youve come back from the pub i dont think ill be going out of my way to watch it again but if im late back from the pub one night  its on tv who knows my score 6510,black_comedy
its indeed very hard to describe this movie this is a rare master piece whose genre are horror and comedy when i say this this is not the scary movie type junkies where horror is made fun but this flick is of ultimate entertainmenta man who lives with his carefree friend who was dumped by his girl friend wakes up after all night booze to find a girl in their homes backyard when they approach to help her they find she is a zombie and the fun begins after that they come to know the whole city is full of zombies and they need a safe place to quarantine themselves so on the way he picks up his mom his girl friend and some of the other friends and they get into a pub in midst of all these events they are constantly attacked by the zombies powered by emotional drama at times but with a laugh riot in each scene this is a rare piece of gem which will make you scare feel bad with a smile on your face through the flick if you want to see a different type of flick from the stereo types go for it three cheers to the crew and their finest acting and not to forget some mindblowing dialogs,black_comedy
in this spoof of dawn of the dead london is under siege by zombies as a sales clerk heroically attempts to lead his family and friends to safety the film wants to have it both ways  be a gory horror film and be a comedy with the result being mild amusement the funniest moments are the tv reports about zombies and the best way to deal with them while the concept is initially somewhat funny in that understated british humor style it soon runs of steam and goes on far too long pegg who cowrote the screenplay makes a good nerdy hero somehow this middling comedy has achieved the same kind of cult status as the film it is spoofing,black_comedy
first of all the acting in this movie is natural and thats perfect thats what many comedy movies need it does help to this movie to be funny and to have a great piece of humor i can watch this movie every weekend and i recommend to everyone to watch this movie in free weekend it makes you to smile for a little bit before hard week starting the second thing is that this movie has an interesting story which goes and comes around the most important thing is winchester where the most interesting action happens so sad that only two of them shaun and liz survived but i was glad by the end to see one survived zombie who still lived his normal all day life ed after all the movie is well done 2004 it had to be the comedy of the year it does have very funny and perfect movie thing elements wonderful and great family movie910,black_comedy
the first half hour of is the best part for viewers like me who love movies and wanted to see this cult classic but who dont like seeing human beings disemboweled and cannibalized the first half hour is also the funniest part the zombies dont come out in full force until later in the filmthe first part of the film brilliantly parodies the conventions of zombie films shaun looks and works like a zombie film but its depicting average working class britons going about their daily lives this isnt just funny its pointed social commentary simon pegg the writer  star is suggesting with as much depth and more cleverness than becket that daily life is a struggle through crushing routine and that escapes and rewards like booze cigarettes video games and friends who suck us into lives of low expectations dull and blind us all in the best scene in the movie the zombies have already taken over and shaun doesnt even realize it he crosses a street full of zombies enters a store wrecked by zombies selects his standard snacks from a freezer case covered with handprints slips in a pool of blood and never notices a thingeventually of course the inevitable gore splatters across the screen loved ones turn into zombies and must be killed friends are eaten alive by zombies ravenous zombies menace the few remaining humans it gets pretty gross and scary and stops being as funny as it had been,black_comedy
shauns life is in a rut in danger of losing his girlfriend a let down to his family and his best friend is a total loser then fleshchomping zombies suddenly start to take over the city and shaun is thrust into the mix as a potential saviour of his family and friendsin 1999 a channel 4 sitcom called spaced written by simon pegg and jessica stevenson and directed by edgar wright become a massive cult hit because of its popculture references sharp music movie geekery and jokes lots of jokes is born out of an episode of that show called art where a sketch had a drug induced pegg fighting off a resident evil inspired zombie invasion for the big screen outing wright again directs with pegg and many of the spaced cast also turning up for the fun and horror frolicsis of course a play on george romeros dawn of the dead something that straight away sets the marker for exactly what type of film to expect with shaun the makers are proudly homaging and parodying a genre of film they so obviously love in fact one can have enough of a good time just spotting the horror references and links that dot themselves throughout the picture however in amongst the frivolity and there is much of that is the point that zombies amble thru real life frequently there is a chance that as you laugh here you will also be faced with a horrified recognition of every day life so with that comes close to being a dark comedy masterpiece its not for nothing that our main protagonists and heros in waiting are slackers extrordinair life strugglers whos only solace is beer and video games think about itfalling down just a touch with its eagerness to contain some serious moments shaun does however deserve its place on any list containing great horror comedies and not just british ones either perhaps surprisingly because of its very british sensibility it has proved very popular with american audiences more so thru its various disc releases notable fans such as romero himself and horror writing tsar stephen king have stepped forward to voice approval if it at times it feels like its a bunch of mates making a horror comedy thats because it is and hooray to that because cinema and the subgenre the film belongs too is all the better for it the team from here went on to make the brilliant action cop homage hot fuzz and at some point we will see the completion of their icecream trilogy with the release of the worlds end i and many others simply cant wait for the latest instalment from a team of movie lovers making movies for movie lovers 8510,black_comedy
simon pegg and nick frost deliver performances that are nothing short of great in their zombie comedy zomedyin my opinion isnt necessarily funny but just because a movie isnt funny doesnt mean its not any goodbesides from not being funny is a fun and gory zombie movie thats well worth its praise from people like george a romero peter jackson and stephen kingi even liked it better than the average hot fuzzyou can expect two best friends rising from their couch and stop watching tv in order to protect themselves from flesh eating zombiesyou can also expect a movie that is both lots of fun and quite goryjust dont expect anything oscar worthy,black_comedy
when i heard the name i assumed it to be a movie that would prank other horror movies and be of worthless comedy but my o my i was at the receiving end this time this is a hell of a movie a very original plot and and amazing way of presenting something you never thought of about zombies this movie is an epitome of intelligent humor that one hardly gets these dayssimon pegg and nick forest in one word are brilliant ably supported by kate ashfieldhere lucy davis deserves special mentioning for her reluctant and confused kind of characterand the end is something that is mmmm wow all in all a real catchif you do not have this dvd in your collection mate you are missing a gem,black_comedy
id been meaning to watch this film for a while and was slightly disappointed in it but it is quite funnythe idea of a comedy zombie film set in suburban england is a good one and there are some very funny scenes the film is based around typical british institutions such as the local pub male bonding the deferential british mammy and this leads to some good lines familiar faces such as penelope wilton and bill nighy appear along with newer faces such as simon pegg i thought hot fuzz was funnier though,black_comedy
well now hers a bit of a little comedy well lets start with shaun a typical guy with a dead end life and an idiot friend dragging him down hes having problems with his friends family job and love life so how can we fix this have a zombie holocaust it truly is the best way to sort out your lifewell really and truly this movie is quite funny but it takes a few watches in order to really get it fully at first the movie appears to be more horror but as you watch it again you notice more and more of the comedy edge through it truly is one of the more interesting comedies ive seen and for that it deserves good props though outdone in comedy by hot fuzz it truly is a well done film worth multiple watches,black_comedy
i have watched this film so many times and i still find it absolutely hilarious it makes me laugh every timethe story was really good and the zombies were excellent and originalthe comedy and the characters were fantastic they didt go over top with cheesiness i think it shows us typical british people would do in that type of situationi also thought by watching it many times you always notice something different every timei think it really is a grate fun film to watch bits of it make you jumpbut the rest of it made me laugh out loud and always does,black_comedy
i like in general the british form of humor i had heard of this movie but hadnt seen it and last week found it on the shelves at my local public libraryi like simon pegg and he is shaun the kind of guy who doesnt have much drive or ambition he likes a simple life hanging out with his friends at the local pub and having a nice girlfriend pretty kate ashfield is liz shauns girlfriend but she is getting tired of shauns ways he accommodates her gripes by promising to do things but he never does them so liz is dumping him shaun is energetic compared to his lifelong friend nick frost as ed who lives with shaun and the other roommate but contributes nothing and just likes to play video gamesone fateful day all the newspapers have headlines about some mysterious virus that is causing people to become dangerous zombies when shaun and his friends become threatened he leads them towards the pub as a place of shelter the other main characters are lucy davis as dianne and dylan moran as davidexpectations are dangerous and in view of its high imdb rating i was expecting something much better i was entertained but dont rate it so high,black_comedy
electronics salesman shaun simon pegg finds his monotonous existence getting a bit of a shakeup when a zombie outbreak sees him becoming the leader of a small group of desperate survivorsthe first time i watched this romantic comedy with zombies or romzomcom as this small subgenre has apparently been dubbed i felt a little disappointed i suspect that the hype surrounding the film was to blame somewhat for raising my expectations unreasonably highhowever after a second viewing i can now report that is actually much better than i at first thought being packed with plenty of witty dialogue quirky humour likable characters and loads of fun horror film references whilst i still believe that the ending loses its way a little with much of the comedy being ditched in favour of gore action and attempts at emotional drama as horror comedies go this is definitely one of the bestthe deadpan and often surreal humour certainly wont be to everyones taste but those who enjoyed director edgar wrights tv series spaced and who have watched an unhealthily disproportionate amount of zombie films will be guaranteed a good time as pegg and friends lampoon the dead films of george romero with an obvious and genuine affection for the genrebest moment when nick frost shouts were coming to get you barbara pure class,black_comedy
simon pegg and edgar wrights hybridizes dawn of the dead and 28 days after then infuses them into a british romantic comedy this improbable combination of elements is nicely blended due to a solid script and very good directingjust as pathological loser shaun is dumped by his beloved girlfriend an outbreak of zombification occurs in london inspired to show his true colors grow up and take the bull by its horns all at once shaun and his shutin roommate ed develop a plan to rescue shauns mum stepdad girlfriend and his best friends by locking down in the pub which inspired the break upmost of the laughs result from gender stereotypes epitomized by shaun and ed and typical horrorcomedy stuff though this is a relatively lowbrow comedy the characters are sympathetic and real enough to carry the story directing and cinematography are a and like the script very britishhighly recommended for horrorcomedy fans recommended for comedy fans weakly recommended for horror fans for everybody else  this is a good movie night film for a relaxing evening with friends booze and popcorn,black_comedy
if looks like an extended episode of or a pilot for a british tv series then that is no bad thing since those involved have mainly cut their teeth on television and this is the kind of thing that television does so well alternative comedy on british television has always been so much better than anything the big screen has given us in recent times it is of course a homage to and a pastiche of romeros zombie movies as well as being formatted in such a way as to pay tribute to the best of the comic strip creationsits genuinely funny but it works because it also takes itself seriously in this respect it is vastly superior to danny boyles misguided zombie movie 28 days later of course you need to be very clever indeed to pull off a lampoon of a genre that has become somewhat selfconsciously a lampoon in itself there is only so much you can do with putrid decomposing corpses that wont lie down no matter what go for the brain is the advice given here and with each succeeding movie the fright factor diminishes so if shaun never hits a perfect ten on the terror scales it comes reasonably close where pity is concerned the skill of the filmmakers is in creating characters we believe in and whose fate we care about no mean feat in what is essentially a grossout comedy but then the british have always been good at this sort of thing applying an intelligence to the proceedings that american can only dream about,black_comedy
its not the first time that someone uses zombies to make a comedy and it definitely wont be the last but wrights movie is extremely hilarious it has an incredible rhythm and all the actors are damn funny especially nick frost besides its been well filmed with such a simple and modern styleit wont go down in history but it wont disappoint you if youre looking for entertainment and funmy rate 610   ,black_comedy
is a excellent comedy film showing that simon pegg and edgar wright are two of the best comedy talents to come out of britain in recent yearsis a movie that works on a number of levels it is a parody of the zombie films made by george a romero and unlike films like epic movie and meet the spartans they do it out of a love of the films and dont throw in everything that was mildly popular at the time romero liked the film so much he even gave pegg and wright a cameo in land of the dead also works because it is well written with get jokes and dialogue and good acting from pegg and nick frost it has a fun plot and shows the problems of the romero films such as the zombie moving slowly and uses these problems it has other jokes besides from making fun of the zombie and horror genre which helps the film a lot and has issues such as relationships between partners and friendsthe story of the film was shaun pegg is man in his late twenties and has little to show for it he works at an electronics store in north london he lives in a house with his best friends from university and primacy school and both of them dont get along shaun was also struggling with his relationship with his girlfriend and had a strain relationship with his stepfather the brilliant bill nighy and he spend most of his free time at the winchester pub and playing playstation games to top things off the dead are raising from their graves and starting to roam london but noone seems to notice liz kate ashfield broke with shaun near the beginning of the film and he tries to get up together with her as the zombie start to become more numerous and danger more inevitable shaun sees it as the perfect opportunity to get back in lizs good books and planned to save her and his mum and go to the winchester until the situation had blown over however he plan unravels as he tried to save themthe film is deliciously violence fans of modern british comedy such as spaced and the office will find a lot of to like about it they are also good cameos from coldplay and trisha and on the dvd expands of these on the extras is worthy of multiple viewers and is a great film,black_comedy
truly class comedy at its best there nothing more funny than the rips of truly classy films like night of the living dead one time the the british film industry actually got something right it starts out with the aura of a truly horrid living dead classic and then turns it into a side splitting comedy american pie eat your heart out out with bad beer scenes and in with record throwing classics writers directors my hat is taken off to you with a truly amazing piece of work truly charismatic acting from the outset this man has a future his simplistic ability in front of the camera is amazing his costar is not more than a hop and a skip behind him this pair make this movie like the original digital box adverts they is no reason why it should work but hey monkey it does i will watch this movie again and again till either the wife throws me out of the dvd player gives up its ghost,black_comedy
its a zombie film and i liked it in spite of the fact that i dont usually like zombie films of course the story is daft but the acting is excellent the comedy element is comical the horror element is horrible and there are a few very touching scenes the combination in my opinion is extremely entertaining it still makes me laugh even though ive watched it several times i totally recommend itis incredibly entertaining funny gruesome and packed with lots of extras if youre familiar with some of the zombie classics youll appreciate more of the jokes but even if youre not youll be laughing and cringing all the samei wont spoil it but the ending is absolutely classic,black_comedy
slacker shaun simon pegg is not having a great time lately his job sucks his girlfriend liz kate ashfield left him and his roommate pete peter serafinowicz is a prick oh and zombies are taking over london but all things change when with cricket in hand shaun and his idiotic best friend ed nick frost head out on a rescue mission to save shauns mum penelope wilton shauns soontobe zombie stepdad bill nighy liz and whoever else decides to hop on along the wayis without a doubt the best horrorcomedy ro come out   ever not only that but its easily in the top small percentage of all zombie flicks filled with humour from fart jokes to ones with actual depth   hell even the fart jokes had depth by the end gore violence and fan tastic writing  direction takes the cake as the best romzomcom in history though   there arent many contenders in that particular subsubsubgenrefinal rating 1010ap3,black_comedy
here is a modern horrorcomedy that has managed to keep me laughing from start to finish the humor in this movie wasnt the ridiculous jackass and scary movie humor that we always see today this movie wasnt trying with all its might to be funny like those movies this movie was just naturally funny and it wasnt like the holy crap that was so bad it was funny humor either it was good and funny shaun simon pegg and ed nick frostare oblivious to the zombies until the zombies literally break into their house other than that theyre living out their normal lives i give this movie a 1010 it was funny had good action and i was never bored watching it,black_comedy
isnt so much a parody of the of the dead films as some would assume at first the concept is essentially how would everyday people react when the zombie apocalypse happens there arent any dark mysterious pasts behind any of these characters theyre everyday people dealing with everyday problems with zombieswhats fantastic about this film is the way it covers several genres no matter how unorthodox in fashion of course this is primarily a comedy so almost every moment has some humor when everything seems bleakest theres always something to lighten the mood somewhat whether it be a reference to something earlier in the film or something as simple as eds i got wood tshirt theres always humor to it no matter how subtle if youre a fan of the horror genre this wont disappointed as there are some generally uncomfortable moments still fantastic overall if you havent seen it yet please go out and rent it or even better buy it you owe it to yourself,black_comedy
i saw hot fuzz the other film from the same filmmaking team of edgar wright and the actor simon pegg before i saw and thought overall it was a stronger movie but shaun has much to recommend it in its own rightwhere hot fuzz parodies action buddy movies takes as its target movies like george romeros night of the living dead series and its countless imitators theres a lot of cheeky humour and grisly gore played for laughs and the whole thing is thoroughly entertaining without ever quite feeling like a comedy classicgrade a,black_comedy
whats that a british comedy you say hugh grant is it no well at least richard curtis will have written it so it should be ok what hes not involved either surely you jest no i do not thank god there are some courageous people out there or this would never have been given the green light which would have been a tragedy because its one of the most original refreshing and downright funny british films for yearsnohoper shaun pegg is stuck in a rut his life is on hold much to the frustration of his girlfriend liz ashfield the situation is not helped by the everpresent ed frost shauns best friend but who sadly is a lazy computer game playing slob with the tendency to drag the devoted shaun down with him shauns life revolves around apart from ed that is his local pub the winchester but liz wants him to motivate himself to be more adventurous and more ambitious she fails however and finally gives him the elbow shaun is gutted he drowns his sorrows with ed and in doing so misses out on the overnight takeover of the planet by undead zombies dont use the z word the next morning in his hung over state he routinely walks down to his local shop but is totally oblivious to the carnage and the aforesaid walking dead all about him only finally noticing when two turn up in his garden after trying to dispatch them by throwing various kitchen appliances and longplaying records selected  not the good stuff shaun finally discovers that a good whack about the head with a cricket bat does the job after this rude awakening from their booze induced slumber shaun and ed decide to rescue girlfriend liz shauns dotty mother and a stepfather hes never gotten along with and take them somewhere they know is safe and secure  the winchester of course easier said than done the origins of the title are obvious and billed as a romantic comedy  with zombies or a romzomcom this is exactly what it says on the can the zombies are suitably romeroish and deadly serious the action is as graphic as it gets with guts being ripped out and limbs ripped off but still handy for beating zombies over the head with and although theres plenty of humour along the way to keep the mood light there is genuine anxiety when these touchingly drawn dysfunctional characters are in jeopardy which stops it short of being an evil dead 2 which was funny but plain sillythe entire cast is excellent particularly pegg who also cowrote the script and frost who virtually reprise their roles from the comedy series spaced which also starred jessica stevenson and peter serafinowicz who have smaller roles in this also the rest of the cast consists of other luminaries from recent britcom series black books and the award winning the office plus the terrific penelope wilton calendar girls and bill nighy love actually underworld as shauns mum and stepfatherthe special features are extensive in fact more than i think ive seen on any other dvd and include as well as all the usual stuff the full length spoof tv spots and news bulletins that we only see snippets of in the movie a video diary of two extras who played a couple of zombies four different audio commentaries and lots moreim still chuckling at single lines from the movie i dont really think its in me to shoot my flatmate my mother and my girlfriend all on the same day and i really cant recommend this highly enough to both horror and britcom fans,black_comedy
what can i say i adore this film i love simon and edgar collaborations and this is brilliant funny witty inventive and a great showcase of the zombie genre the writing is great and watching this film a second or even ten times is a must i have noticed so many things i didnt the first time round and so many ironies and gagswhat i love is how quotable the film is and how it depicts the horror genre without true drama and tragedy but with a laugh yet shaun remains convincing throughout and the situation is totally realistic if zombies existed the characters are all great and bill nighy is fab as step dad phillip and the pool cue beating set to dont stop me now by queen is genius it is filmed and directed fantastically with great detail and care and its got plenty of blood and guts if thats your thingsimon pegg is such a great actor and he is so easy to watch he makes me laugh and feel sad and his partnership with nick frost is inspiringoverall a cult film in my opinion so much better than any other modern comedies which rely too much on gross out humour rather than wit and intelligence plus this has got the blood too what more could you want as the film poster says its got romance too but not heavy on itif you havent seen it yet what are you waiting for,black_comedy
this movie is done with such hidden and brilliant humour its like the arrested development of british films if that makes sense i simply love iti am aware of the zomb o meter on the dvd and love that too it tells a lot of hidden things and information about the movie as you watch it its great however there are some things they missed now they might have done this on purpose so they dont spoil the entire movie i understand here are some of thembefore liz dumps shaun he goes to the store and buys a regular coke after she dumps him he buys a diet coke insteadthe first zombie they encounter is named mary and can be seen scanning groceries in the opening creditsthe first dialogue when said all together is a sexual dialogue but when put apart is just different conversationsit is kind if hard to understand but when liz says we met in greece david says under his breath at a rave also when shaun asks does anyone have a car diane says yes no well i passed my testthere are others and i might do another comment,black_comedy
is a very good and enjoying film like bits when in the pub and taking the micky out of the characters in there and also little individual bits which are funny but also there is a few gory scenes like when his friend get a ripped apart from the belly but thats the only really gory scene in the film thirdly a quarter of the film is about romance but they split up when shaun was always going the pub and not doing anything enjoying with his girlfriend so they split up and then shaun and his best friend see someone in the garden which they put on the news to find out why there is a lot incidents as the film goes on they grab a few people which are survivors of the film basically the main characters like his girlfriend and his best friend and some other people,black_comedy

i just watched this movie about a few months ago and i have to say this movie is awesome just awesomeits pretty hard to pull of a horrorcomedy movie but the guys who made this one did it and in style thats why this is a great movie because it is a funny and partially gory horror movie there are a lot of funny stuff in this movie especially to do with the two main characters shaun and ed and it is also interesting about all of the movie references put in throughout the movie which are well placed into the filmthe gore throughout the movie isnt as bad as i would have expected although there are some scenes that were pretty goryi dont want to spoil any of the film for you people out there who havent seen this but all of you who havent seen this movie watch it or else why would you be reading a comment about the movie in the first place and if you have seen this movie already be sure to watch it againgo for it hire it out or borrow it from a friend and watch it right nowmy rating 1010,black_comedy
ok so it may not be the scariest but this is probably the best horror film ive seen in a long time technically its a comedy but well keep that quiet for now having seen hot fuzz and loving it naturally i had to get the dvd of this and i have to say it was very hard to find even in the uk where its very popular but i finally did and here we are anyway the film its hilarious it really is a romantic comedy with zombies it works really well as an homage the living dead series because the zombies follow romeros laws for pretty much most of the film and are never directly funny themselves which is very important its what is done to them and the way the characters react to them that makes the film funny if the zombies had been made in any way comedic then this film would have failed thats what i really like about this filmit also makes a jab at things that happen in real life that you never think of such as would you like another tissue which people ask bitten people who are holding a wad of tissues over their zombie wounds which is one of those little things that i like about itthe visual style of the film is pretty impressive referencing video games etc using a kinetic directorial style during a lot of the action sequences and switching to firstperson occasionallylike hot fuzz the music in the film is excellent and always fits in with its sceneoverall the film works excellently as an homage and a standalone zombie film and deserves its cult status,black_comedy
is a mustsee film for all lovers of comedy or horror the ridiculous plot characters dialogs and events in the movie are not just hilarious but also smart and well written the horror aspects can be gory but are funny at the same time this movie is very different from many of the horny and shallow american teen comedies of recent years expect something completely fresh and differentthe plot revolves around shaun who is trying to change his mundane daily routine and improve his spotty lovelife when the country is suddenly hit by an all out zombie outbreak the movie juggles comedy horror and some romance and manages to deliver on all three of thoselike the movie it was based on also comments on modern society in a clever and unconventional way adding even more to this amazing film the perfect comedic delivery of simon pegg and nick frost really make this movie stand out as one of the best comedies of all timeif you havent seen this movie and the concept sounds even remotely appealing then go watch it now who could possibly be disappointed by a movie that combines zombies romance and humor into one crazy movie,black_comedy
this movie is on my list of best movies ive ever seen i really love horrors that ware also directed as comedies as already mentioned dawn of the dead ive never laughed this hard at a moviewell for someone it can be a little violent but if your thinking about scenes and bloody jokes youll be satisfied simon pegg with nick frost are a great couplewell if you enjoy witty jokes and btitish humor youll enjoy this film and the best scene in a the movie i think the scene in the end with billiard cues and with song by qeen was just great  and if you loved that as i did get hot fuzz  another movie by e wright and with great simon pegg,black_comedy
it used to be that the americans copied british ideas for entertainment this film suggests that the opposite is now taking placea british twist on the zombie filmthe film is presented as a spoof on zombie films but instead it really is a silly zombie film rather than a spoof on a zombie film the only british aspect of the film is that they retreat to a pub instead of a mall big deal as a comedy it has its moments but it is too much of a zombie film and not enough of a comedy the first time they see a zombie and the ending with zombie as pet are about the only parts i really enjoyedif you like gory films that make no sense whatsoeven that have an occasional joke youll like this onebut dont expect a great film,black_comedy
2004 dir edgar wright life isnt too good for shaun he lives with his best friend ed neglects his girlfriend liz and despises his stepdad when liz dumps shaun he vows to get his life back on track unfortunately this is the day that the dead has decided to come back to life with a cricket bat and ed by his side shaun sets out to rescue those he loves and those he doesnt love and heads to the safest place he knowsthe winchesterits not often that you get zombie horror movies coming from the uk is one of those gems which appeared when audiences needed them the most everything in this movie is great the story is a funny and entertaining script with jokes appearing from every direction the jokes are all funny and can remain funny long after the first viewing the cast were a great choice with everyone playing a perfect character all the zombies look realistic with bits of body missing although many people might think a uk cant make a zombie movie but this would prove them wrongyoure not driving that car  philip bill nighy,black_comedy
actually i was just curious of this movie because of hot fuzzgreat one if you asked me since i discovered it was made by the same person behind the aforementioned i read some reviews and cant help myself but see this one and bam wow cant even believe i missed this kind of movie at the cinema though cant remember if this was shown on our local theatrebut ever since i started watching i was addicted already worth a numerous viewing thanks to its memorable quotes and scenes that to this day keeps me giggle for example where the zombified pub owner was attacked by the three protagonist in the tune of dont stop me now by queen not that original though but still hilarious wright and pegg really deserves some credits herethey did it again in hot fuzz such witty and carefully crafted dialogues i cant even spot some references the fourth time around for its subtlenessthough the story is very simple the humor that keeps the story worth watchable a man in his late twenties shaunpegg with some issues even me faces in life his galashfield his palfrost his flatmateseranifowicz his mumwilton his dad i mean stepdadnighy because of this hes not even distracted by the plague occurrences until the confrontation with the zombie oops the zed word itself so what do you think they should do well have a sit down lol pricelessunlike other movies with characters that can quickly adapt to such situation this movie shows how stupid people can still make stupid plans in the middle of a crisis take car go to mums kill phil  sorry  grab liz go to the winchester have a nice cold pint and wait for all of this to blow over hows that for a change but what a great character development happens to shaun later on the moviei was really sorry for him cant believe myself i feel his pain great execution by the actor two thumbs up though i thought he was a real action star in hot fuzz well he fooled me there shamei really recommend this movie to everyone dont be fooled by the title its not a spoof as everyone thought its more of a homage its a story that spoof itself with references and with tight script no wonder romero love this movie though you may be disturbed for its gore saddened for its heavy scenes laugh for its seriousness and laugh some more for its crazinessthe whole thing is its entertaining it really beats the like of spiderman shrek and pirates of the caribbean sequels  uumm that is not true made up shouldnt have said that sorry makes a good addition to your collection classic already,black_comedy
this movie has to be one of the most unique zombies movies a romancecomedy with zombies unlike many horror films the characters in this movie are very likable furthermore does an excellent job taking jabs at modern life where your average office drone is almost like a zombie my favorite scene was the part in which shaun strolls through his destroyed zombieinfested neighborhood completely oblivious to the mayhem around him i really laughed hard when shaun got a soda from the freezer covered with bloody hand prints the only thing i wished they had done is given pete more screen time pete was probably one of the funniest characters in the movie with lines like its fcking sunday and i have to go to fcking work in four fcking hours cause very other fcker in my fcking department is fcking ill now can you see why im so fcking angry,black_comedy
hilarious think monty python meets zombies it just has such a dry biting wit about it that you have to love it to me this movie like most of the monty python flicks has tons of replay value you can have fun with it time and time again and never get sick of the jokesi think the reason for this is because edgar wright and simon pegg arent trying to hard to be funny their humor appears to be something that just flows naturally for them also simon pegg and nick frost make a great comedic duonot only does it work as comedy but it also works as a great homage to classic zombie flicks which happens to be one of my favorite horror genres it manages to take elements from zombie classic and make them funny without mocking the source materialthe acting is good the zombies look cool and its filled with slightly over the top gore what more could you ask for definitely one of the funniest movies ive seen in awhile,black_comedy
i had never seen this movie until two days ago and if you havent i suggest you do tells about a man named shaun who works in an electronic goods shop he spends his days with his unemployed friend ed either playing video games at home or drinking in a local pub winchester shaun is pretty much what you could describe as a loser he has a girlfriend liz who suddenly after 3 years of being together has had enough of shauns attitude towards things never having an adventure or basically anything different this of course leads to a breakup suddenly almost the whole london catches sort of an epidemic and everyone starts to turn as the living dead zombies shaun figures out that he has his lifes biggest opportunity to prove his exgirlfriend that he is not a loser things lead to another and well its done in a way that wont give you time to stop laughingone thing that surprised me a lot is how well the whole movie was made i mean its a comedy after all and its not every day you see a comedy where theyve really put some time and effort to make it the whole world and the zombies are done like in any other serious movie so believably and so realistically this already gives the movie something that keeps you interested throughout besides the story which in its parodied way is also surprisingly well written although the zombie thing working as the main story in the movie you could imagine the movie as a romantic comedy as well the movie takes a while before the zombies even kick into the plot and the best thing is that the things before that moment is not even irrelevant in any kind of way it kinda evolves the story builds up the characters and the whole main theme letting the viewer inside the actual story brilliant in a way id saythe one thing where the movie has its definite highlight is the humour which is absolutely hilarious to me as a fan of the british accent although to be exact i especially love the cockney accent the movies jokes were top notch you just cant say some things in another accent than the british one and to be honest when i had my finnish subtitles on i really didnt even pay attention to them as some of the jokes are just so poorly translated they loose their purpose and meaning completely although the movie being a total laugh packed ride the jokes sadly start to repeat themselves and it does get a bit repetitive when you think about that its a really hard thing to prevent really when it comes to parodies they usually stumble in that way towards the end so its a very common problem despite it this movie doesnt do it so much you could imagine so its a real achievement the film also includes so called long jokes which arent so funny at the first time but when repeated they eventually get funny and when theyre done in places where you wouldnt expect them at all they have their moment and its magnificentalthough the movie being a parody all the way through i was also surprised how good the acting was in it it does have drama in it too yet done in a satiric way the brilliant simon pegg as shaun nick frost as ed the always hilarious bill nighy as philip the stepfather kate ashfield as liz and dylan moran as david the whole cast is carefully and very successfully chosen when it comes to comedies like this one the acting is usually done over the top to make it funnier well the acting in this movie also goes over the top but its done so unbelievably well by amazing actorsactresses and in a way ive never seen before usually when the acting is meant to be over the top its usually funny at the first time but you get bored of it very quickly and it gets so unfunny and i cant believe im saying this unrealistic though it is actually meant to be unrealistic does the unrealistic so realistically and the unbelievable so believably now thats what i call a huge achievement very nice indeedis all in all a great comedy it has a surprisingly good storyline which keeps you interested throughout including humour which just makes you laugh so hard even giggle after the actual movie has ended its silly but its silly in a good way they dont make comedies like this so much and when they do its a great achievement its always a real gem for the comedy film industry and you just have to give your two thumbs up the movie sadly suffers from already mentioned slight repetitiveness but when it comes to the end it really doesnt matter so much but thats what also lowers my final rating of the movie if you want to laugh seriously is a movie for you great,black_comedy
i finally saw this after many people had built it up for me and im happy to report that it was all i ever hoped it could be is a truly original style of film it is not a parody though it is funny and does play with references to some wellknown horror films it is a fresh creative zombie story in its own right and simultaneously a comedy the nods to previous zombie movies are clever and come naturally unlike how excruciatingly forced they are in lesser films like the scary movie franchise the characters are all very honest real and have distinct personalities most of the film takes place in the day time with the main characters handling the situation quite rationally it is a fantastically successful new spin on things and highly recommended,black_comedy
has 23 of the most ingenious british comedy of 2004 or for that matter the past several years and even has that appeal that romantic comedies only wish they could achieve in their timing and believable characters however slackerish they are here then theres something interesting that goes on as edgar wright gets enveloped in making a pure zombie movie and for me odd as it sounds it doesnt totally work i could understand why the shift comes as danger looms in with the undead taking over the british village pegg and frost have to defend at all costs at the same time its not quite as fulfilling as the razorsharp satire and visual wackiness that went on in the main chunk of the picture this being said its the kind of cult movie that works at its best because it feeds off of said previous cult movies like a flesheater on an intestinal tract it knows how stupid it would be however entertaining in an abstract way if the undead started to rise and took over a little town or suburb or other lets go to the pub isnt too far of a stretch for these guys as the mall was in dawn of the deadas it stands from having seen the film quite a while ago it stays fresh in your mind for a while for what works wonderfully in its violent and absentminded glory hmm whats really going on here is the tone for the first part as well as a plum supporting role from bill nighy and from what doesnt quite work the last section unfortunately doesnt quite strike up the same level of delirious humor that it should and ironically compared to the original dawn of the deads last section its deadpan without being hilarious and just a straightforward horrorfest which is fine but the shift is sort of jarring and something that i didnt think quite recovered by the end of the film albeit with the nice wink in the final shot its the kind of good british comedy that works best with a bunch of friends and a totally tunedin sense of humoror perhaps just someone looking for a different level of social satire with their zombie movie,black_comedy
this is one of those movies that comes by only once in a while is a great comedy and film simon pegg fits perfectly as shaun and ed is a legendarily funny character one of the best comedies ever made probably the best horror spoof ever made you bet all of the other actors fit their characters very well but as funny as this movie is it still has some good scares the zombies look very good not too overly gory or gruesome looking there are several memorable lines that you just want to say over and over again this brings us to the soundtrack of the movie it has some great songs especially the blue wrath the song at the beginning by imonster a queen song also plays in a very memorable scene if only they would release the soundtrack in america this is a definite worthy film of buying well at least rent it people or borrow it from a friend this a great film with infinite laughs and a piece of comedy genius,black_comedy
this is one of the most completely hilarious modern british films i have ever seen i am not a big fan of brit movies normally but this one is brilliant its obvious low budget works for it really really well the strength lies in the performance without the need for big bangs and flashy expensive overblown special effectsthe sequence when shaun walks to the local corner shop past the undead without noticing anything even vaguely wrong is a true classicthe only reason for giving it a 7 is the rather overlong sequence in the pub but the pace picks up and the ending is priceless i am really looking forward to simon peggs new movie hot fuzz,black_comedy
utterly brilliant horrorcomedy with one of the smartest screenplays in recent memory and some great visuals every scene in the film is either a reference to another horror film or a foreshadowing of what to come and it works perfectly the humour is very dry but very sharp making it very unlike a film like anchorman while remaining just as funny as that the direction and editing are surprisingly fresh for a comedy and the gore effects are great fun add to that some terrific acting especially by nick frost as the big comedic lug and bill nighy as the evil stepdad great use of music  dont stop me now anyone  and some great dialogue and this is one of my favourite comedies ever and certainly one of the funniest films of the new millennium,black_comedy
spoilers that is all i can say about this movie it is really funny not to mention gory and bloody there are really good laughs in this movie and you really feel for the characters well except for david there are really scary moments in this movie yet there are moments in this movie that are so funny that you will be laughing for minutes until you can not breathe and you turn a fine purplish color here is the plot it is a lot like dawn of the dead with the title and being locked in a place shaun is a man who has a bad life his girlfriend dumped him and he has a bad job he has a friend named ed then one day zombies take over london they start eating people and turning them into zombies shaun his mother ed his girlfriend and a bunch of other people go to save the day they lock themselves in a pub the zombies kill everyone but shauns girlfriend and shaun luckily the army saves them their lives turn back to normal and shaun still has fun with ed despite the fact that he is a zombieoverall this is one of the funnest movies to watch in 2004 let alone the new century there are hilarious moments and quotes yet there are terrifying and disturbing scenes there are also some really bloody and gory scenes and when i mean some i mean pretty much all of the movie like i said before this is a parody of the movie dawn of the dead which ironically the remake came out the same year as came out a coincidence i think not anyway some scenes tend to drag on but this is a very fun film to watch810recommended films dawn of the dead,black_comedy
i personally dont like horror movies im sensitive when it comes to thatcall me sissy but i got kind of scared after the movie but there were a few laughs the humor was pretty funny kind of like how they said f every other word i was overwhelmed with how many times they said it but it was freaky its not the movie its me the movie was very good it was a very good mixture of horror and humor also a tiny tiny tiny bit cheesy but it was all in the humor definitely a funny movie that you can enjoy w your friends i recommend this movie to anyone who isnt sensitive to blood gore horror it actually wasnt that scary you couldnt compare it to the ring or the grudge or anything like that but the movie was slightly scary but funny i recommend this movie to people who also like humor and making fun of horror movies but there was a lot of blood the white eyes of the zombies were one of the scariest things from my point of view,black_comedy
mix horror romance a big dose of dark british humour  and you get a deadly concoction  you get spoof movies so often fail with me especially the hollywood variety such as scary movie where you see the humour flying out at you from a mile away i have to admit i was a little hesitant about watching this movie i only did so because my brother had it on dvd and insisted that i saw it i also remember it being released in uk cinemas about the same time as the remake of the 70s zombie thriller dawn of the dead which i found disappointing and put me off watching zombie movies for a long time but with i was pleasantly surprisedit starts with shaun the protagonist played by screenwriterfunnyman simon pegg hes twentynine stuck in a deadend job his seventeen year old colleague makes fun of him he has an awkward flatmate pete peter serafinowicz he hates his scrutinising stepfather philip bill nighly he has issues with his mother barbara penelope winton his lazy bestmate ed holds him back in life nick frost he gets dumped by his girlfriend jenny kate ashfield and he spends all day in the winchester pub yes shaun is in a bit of a rut then one night without ever really knowing why shauns locality becomes neighbourhood of the living dead he is at first oblivious to it all suffering from a hangover but soon he realises that zombies are after his blood and he has to buck up his ideas quickly to survive for once in shauns life he has a plan with ed as his sidekick and armed with a cricket bat a spade and a box of old records which by the way make amusing ninja weapons to fend off zombies and he goes to save his mum and jenny in petes car where does he plan to take them to safety thats right  the mecca of shauns life and the focal point of the film  the winchester pub on the way shaun picks up philip and jennys housemates david dylan moran and dianne lucy davis the film contains what you expect from a horror british comedy and romance kind of blood gore action slapstick sarcasm a witty script a love interest and sadly an obvious plot but i will talk more about that laterit has plenty of laughoutloud moments such as when shaun and ed realise the first zombie they meet isnt actually a drunk girl but a dead person who wants their blood and when the group pretend to behave like zombies so they dont bring attention to themselves from the living dead you will learn there is more than one use to a garden swingball the end is also charming but i dont want to speak about thatthe acting is convincing for a spoof movie especially the lazy rather obnoxious ed played by nick frost who decides to have a friendly chat on a mobile phone with a mate while surrounded by zombies he plays your annoying fat mate who slows your life down but is full of clever quips every now and again he would also go off on hilarious rants with shaun about well not a fat lot i wouldnt say there were many outstanding performances or oscar nominations in the movie though but the movie was not made for awards it was made to make you laugh which is what you will undoubtedly be doing so therefore the cowriters simon pegg and edgar wright the same team who made the comedy tvseries spaced and the new movie the big fuzz have certainly achieved their aim now back to the plot for someone who is not a big fan of spoof movies the storyline was so obvious i only had to glance at the title of the movie to guess what was going to happen and without wanting to ruin the movie for you i was right i cant decide if it was a spoof movie of dawn of the dead or 28 days later but thats of little importance the plot is too similar for my liking anyway im not the prude sort and i think when violence blood and expletives are used correctly it can make a good film i dont think was overrun by it but i do think it maybe should have warranted more than a 15 certificate i do not think the film is everybodys cup of tea the sarcasm and the wittiness i particularly liked and the fact it was a fun chillout film to watch but british humour especially the sarcasm and the violence and the swearing can be hit and miss with many people i also think more can have been done with bill nighlys dylan morans and martin freemans characters they are great actors and had relatively small roles than what their reputations deserve i think martin freeman only had two words to say in the whole film maybe the actors only wanted small roles i dont know but i felt they were wasted only a little as there was much more talent in the film that made up for itthere might be something else that you unexpectedly take away from this movie the film may motivate you to give you a kick up the posterior and change your life for shaun it took a town full of zombies to make him do this i certainly hope it takes considerably less than that for the majority of youto conclude as i said before im not a fan of spoofs due to predictable plots and story lines but this is way above its contemporaries its british its different and its dead funny so funny youll be laughing beyond the grave,black_comedy
its a middlelaughable comedy with many typical characteristics of the british humour about a guy who is a loser but doesnt want to accept that he lives with the typical friend who is even loser than him and has a girlfriend that is fed up of him because he wants to do always the same things and wants to go always to the same pub the winchester one morning after his girlfriend dumped him the world around started to change people started to have strange reactions and an ugly face but he didnt even noticed the tv news tried to warn him to a strange epidemic but he didnt care until he found a sympathetic young girl in the garden that he and his friend ed thought just to be a little stoned then they woke up to the reality yes there were zombies to get shaun his friends and his mumits a spoof movie a clear parody to the zombies movies having some great jokes  the ones that the british are specialists to do  but its not the kind of movie that you start to laugh in the beginning and just stop in the end it has its moments some of nonsense comedy some of intelligent humour but also many of typical clichs its not excellent but its not bad either its just in the middle in my particular case i got one extra element of humour i found our friend shaun a bit similar especially in his face to a husband of a friend of mine girl of course it was pretty amazing imagine the films title with his name instead of shauns,black_comedy
this might be my all time favorite movie for various reasons i dont know why i havent made a post about it yet im just lazy sometimes in any case i wouldnt know where to start how frigging brilliant is this movie plot structure dialogue action foreshadowing comedy gore genuine fright genuine laughter genuine touching momentsi guess my real question is can anyone name another film that can so vividly inspire all these emotions at once because i cant think of one as far as i know shaun is the first it really is a new genre of filmlong live simon pegg and edgar wright,black_comedy
is a really funny comedyit sort of makes fun out of all the zombie films ever madeand for those of you who think that the zombie films are silly any way and laugh at them you will find this hilariousshaun is not having a good day his girlfriend has dumped him because he spends too much time with his slob of a mate ed who sits all day at the computer and does no workand she is also fed up with them spending so much time down their local pub the winchester shaun is also being undermined in his job by a young group of trainees who he is supposed to be in charge of his friend pete who he shares accommodation with is sick of lazy ed and wants him out because shaun is so depressed he gets drunk one night with edand neither of them realise that the whole of london is being took over by flesh eating zombiesevery where they are walking chaos is happening all around themwhere they keep flicking over the channels on the tvthey keep missing the latest news on the chaosso they remain totally oblivious its not until ed notices a girl acting very odd in their garden that they decide to go out to investigatethinking that she is drunk they ask her to leaveshe then starts to attack shaun he pushes her she falls back onto a pole that is sticking up out of the ground the pole goes right through her and lots of blood spurts outthey think they have accidentally killed her until she suddenly rises upthey now realise something is definitely wrongthe rest of the film involves shaun and ed trying to rescue girlfriend lizshauns mum and what turns out to be a few otherslizs college friends and shauns stepdad shauns major plan is that they should all make their way to the winchester pub where they will all be safebut will they bethe film towards the end reaches a big anticlimaxi wont say any more this is one of the funniest films ive seen for a long time and its not a bad horror flick eitherthe acting is very goodit combines comedy tragedy and romance all in one which isnt easy to dothe actors are little known all though im sure we will be seeing more of them in the future,black_comedy
this a true cult classic i saw it one year after it was released i had planned to see it in thetas but never got round to it being a huge fan of british films that iam and being an actor myself and seemingly always find myself playing british characters despite being canadian i had to see it pegg shows off his writing chops in fine form and delivers a precise comic performance the rest of the cast especially nick frost are perfect you will quote this film as much as you would pulp fiction after the first few viewings in short its a welcome break from all the films that try to pass for horror these days and this has comedy and romance as well watch it with a group of friends 1010,black_comedy
brillaiant i watched this because of dylan moran factor but found shaun to be hilarious dylans character to be a deadbeatso i guess thats the spin such a reversal of black books for the playershumour is aggressive but also subtle at times a love storey i am married to liz so she understands my plights getting home on a friday night the movie has sight gags and injokes galore this can be watched many times over you will be like a child watching bob the builder you learn and see something different every timeit brings a new meaning to the ashes and the winchester rifle and zombies cheers,black_comedy
shaun of the is absolutely hilarious it is pure brilliance it is stupid ridiculous but still magnificent the plot is basically that zombies start taking over the earth and some average joe simon pegg has to decide what hes going to do about this movie is gory rude but downright great it has some great one liners with some subtle humour the whole movie is basically crazy edgar wright and simon pegg have done a very good job on writing this movie i hope to see and hear more from both of them this may be one of the best movies to come out of the united kingdomoverall i would would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a hilarious fastpaced rollercoaster ride of fun and a whole bunch of hilarity910,black_comedy
shaunsimon pegg along with his friend ed nick frost spend their life in the local pub the winchester after his girlfriend dumps him he decides to finally get his life in orderthis comic violence comedy is hilariously actedshaun and ed dont realise that the world is infested with bloodthirsty zombies until the garden scene all the things that a normal human would realise shaun doesnt for instance when he goes to the shop in the zombie rising morning he goes in to the newsagents and doesnt see the huge hand of blood on the drink window and then he slips over a huge pool of blood on the floorthere is one scene that sent me hysterical when i first saw it in which shaun is flicking through the channels on the tv and every time he flicks channel it is telling you the disaster of the nation  it goes from news to a song and a nature program forming a story about the zombiesis a brilliant comedy horror and all you zombie lovers will crave this movie excellent performances by all the characters and extras 1010,black_comedy
wow how do i say anything when so many others have i feel i have to im a huge fan of zombie movies and horror movies in general and this is almost perfection in sending up those types of filmsthe one thing i noticed was the people making the movie were having a great time making it and it carries over to the screen quite easilyive seen this at least 5 times and each time i notice that the laughs are packed in so tight it demands repeat viewings to catch them all and that spells one great flick in my bookone of my all time favorite parts is when the two main characters come home drunk and blast music at 400am oblivious to anyone around them and the aftermath of that made me laugh to long for its own goodi could go on and on about the many many funny bits but all i really should say is dont miss this one unless you hate comedies or zombie movies completely,black_comedy
is one of the most funniest horror and comedy mix movie of all time the joke is really funny they dont use rude joke so its very interestingall actors do a great job thay acted very funny and entertaining all chats was interesting with a little bit of humor script was good too the plot is interesting what more needs this movie maybe not everything was smart but the end was truly funny and i laugh 4 minutes after watchingso i give to this movie a 1 and i hope that will goes to the best movie of all time top 250,black_comedy
the film is brilliant its the funniest film i have ever seen literally for anybody who has not seen it yet should because there is heart break in it but with comedy as well and the director has made it so well that it goes together he has really made a good film even if it is two years old i still laugh when ever i see it shaun in the film is really funny and for people who didnt know he was in land of the dead and that was a good film to but im commenting on most people say horror and comedy doesnt work but in a matter of fact it dose work if its made right and not some film that they could not be bothered doing job like some films i have seen which where pathetic which seemed good in the ads but turned out to be crap,black_comedy
tom excrusiating and brad pittsoftheearth and all the rest of those overpaid undertalented nutcases in hollywood should be strapped to chairs have their eyes and ears superglued open and be forced to watch this it was made on a budget about the same as a jolie nice dress and it contains more fun in one minute than in the whole filmography of 99 of hollywouldnt stars none of the people in this film tried to influence governments of third world countries to close their borders just because some chick was having a baby none of these people are trying to convert the world to follow their own scientific system of taking your money its a real filmpeople watch it and dont support the sinister manipulators of science sometimes only a cricket bat will do,black_comedy
this movie has been in the top 3 most played media on my dvd player over the last two years the first two being criterions fear and loathing in las vegas and the episode of family guy when brian become a drug sniffing police dog it has all the right elements in the wright proportions sorry about the punshaun simon pegg is a precarousel everyman working at a dead end job translation  29 year old appliance salesman he lives with 2 roommates that are the antithesis of each other one is ed nick frost the overweight slightly lecherous fartmaking gorilla impersonating pot smoking coincidental underachiever the other is pete peter serafinowicz who is a type a personality shaun also has a counterpart his girlfriend liz kate ashfield who has never met his mother and wishes they could spend more time alone together without ed  how oxymoronic diane and david are lizs friends aka eds counterpart rounding up the cast is shauns mom and philip hes not my dad hes my stepdad bill nighy shaun can be characterized much like ed nortons fight club character in the modern world shaun is just ordinary or worse mediocre in the extraordinary circumstances he has been placed in he excels or perhaps find a purpose the information about what is happening is in the background of the movie newspaper headlines tv new reports unusual people activitiesetc however in a fashion typical to modern man tends to be ignored or dismissed until it has to be taken care of on a personal basis it is an interesting commentaryrelationship on the oversaturated senses of modern humans and the media creators it is also in line with the zombie genre explanation of why things are happeningsimon pegg and edgar wright continue their writingdirecting magic from spaced they bring along most of the cast with them as well nick pete jessica stevenson and a couple others now credited as zombie extras the dialog is great it is sharp full of humor and doublesided the two provide a lot of homage to everything from grandmaster flash  john romero to john carpenter  video games the movie is a great mix of horror comedy and dramatic moments there were moments i shed some salty drops and others when i was spasming on the floor laughing humor in the face of bizarre and terrifying moments is the overwhelming themethere are more quotable quotes and scenes than i have the space or time to write out also it might detract from you enjoyment of the movie my three favorite moments would have to be 1 zombie acting 1012 the choreographed zombie beatdown to queendont stop me now3 introductory title sequence where the mundane activities of the extras are choreographed to i monsterblue wrathif you havent seen this movie i dont know what else to say that will convince you that this is one of the best movies of the new millennium i you have seen it then bugger off maybe you should go back and see it one more time since its obvious you havent had your fill yet get stuffed ,black_comedy
while my husband is a huge fan of the zombie genre i cant handle anything more intense than  hmm whats that one where theyre inside the mall anyway was fantastic in many ways first of all i liked the characters miraculous for me and appreciated their realism however annoying some of their traits are second the humor sometimes so subtle as to give one that selfsatisfying feeling of slight genius was intelligent for the most part and did not dwell in the basement of tired poopoo jokes and nonstop slapstick that 96 percent of hollywood films try to pass off as cleverness also it was refreshing not to feel like i was being sold a soundtrack i hate that fantastic acting great mix of humor and pathos gore that was palatableer or so to speak i loved it so we bought it,black_comedy
strange comedy unusually intense but the laughs keep coming one way or another i love how the zombies blend in so easily at first shaun must have seen 17 zombies before he finally figured it out similarly it was entertaining how a number of the main characters were or could be mistaken for zombies during the course of their regular routine including shaun his mom and ed the obnoxious yet lovable roommate the mexican standoff with the beer bottles and the zombie mom was priceless a nice shout out to tarantino it was a very today type of movie for various reasons allusions eclectic blend of movie genres all gathered into one and an edgy use of the camera almost as if to say we know you know you are watching a movie so why try to keep it a secret could be classified as a comedy horror romantic comedy buddy flick or family drama and they would all be a little right so rules,black_comedy
ill just start off by saying that shuan of the dead rules it is a great representation of british humour and the british lifestyle i was so glad to see that they stuck with genuine british slang and didnt dumb it down for the american audiences just a small question why does it take so long for shauns flatmate pete to become a zombie he tells shaun and ed at 4am that he was bitten on his way home from work so im assuming at the latest he was bitten around 6pm so after 8 hours he still hasnt become a zombie whereas shauns mother and father sorry stepfather becomes zombies in much less time whats up with that,black_comedy
this is a great film i have been a fan of the british sense of humour for as long as i can remember black books a tv show written by dylan moran and staring moran and bill bailey possibly the two funniest people in the world is the best of all british comedy shows i mention this because often an episode of black books has a small character in them who has a few lines nearly every one of those minor characters were in this film apart from the lead female kate ashfield every character in the film has been in black books fans of black books or fans of british comedy in general as it is the only real comedy should see this filmalso watch out for the clever lines in the film as they really lift it to a new level,black_comedy
every year despite a lot of rubbish being shown at the average multiplex if you look hard enough there are plenty of excellent films to inspire you however it is rare than any of these gems are comedies original comedies i though were a dying art form but joy of joys this popped up to give me hope that all is not dead ahem the film is smart hilarious excellently paced and does not fade with repeated viewings i have to take issue with some comments that it should have tried to be funny all the way through im sorry but if you want a gag a minute go and watch scary movie 4 poignancy and drama have every place in comedies you need to build scenes not go headlong into weak gags because someone hasnt said something funny for 40 secondsanyway pegg  co great film fellas1010ps  for our us cousins its not a paddle its a cricket bat look up ashes 2005 for truly great sporting theatre,black_comedy
this movie had me in stitches with its brilliant subtle british comedy and satire of modern life among bored young people but its also a full on horror movie and the combination of these two genres has been tried and tested and when its done right you get a movie thats worthwhileand thank god the zombies are of the classic kind dont get me wrong the superzombies that are in 28 days later and dawn of the dead 2004 are scary but theres something more horrifying about the slowmoving and dimwitted zombies this deserves a place among similarly made films like the classic an american werewolf in london highly recommended to genre fans910,black_comedy
i have to admit that im a spaced fan maybe thats why i enjoyed so much because im not much of a zombie movie fan i rented out on dvd and watched it guiltily on my own as my wife doesnt do horror despite the creators conceit of calling it a romantic zombie comedy although romzomcom is an amusing abbreviationthe film trips along at a steady pace and manages to mix the slacker wit of spaced with a lowbudget homage to george a romeros dead moviesthe romantic part of the movie is pretty wet i cant imagine any attractive and intelligent young woman wanting to be with a tosser like shaun even if he did manage to save her from being turned into a zombiebut forget this minor niggle is otherwise chockfull of entertainment spaced fans will spend their time merrily spotting references to their favourite cult tv series as well as counting cameos from its cast celebrity spotters will also pick up on the cameos by various wellknown tv comedy actors and theres some stop there no back a bit fun to be had trying to find the uncredited celebs who appear as zombies as in spaced the movie is littered with filmic references and its a shame that there isnt a homageometer option in the subtitle menu to point them all outthe obvious fun that director edgar wright and writeractor simon pegg had making this film translates onto the screen if youre a spot the plot hole kind of person youll hate this film but if you like a giggle and a dollop of ketchup then its right up your eerily deserted suburban street wellacted and even genuinely emotional in places is a good advert for lowbudget british filmmaking go see,black_comedy
they picked their subtitle well a blend of genres like never before and a success real gore this is a parody that pays homage to gore i quote simon pegg himself thereway above spoofs this is a weird exercise in directing where none of the two must prevail over the other and where the audience never know whether theyre going to laugh or be scared nextnot a fan of horror movies myself i found this was so odd but so nicely done that us film makers really have a lot to learn about stillfabulous,black_comedy
amazing its my favourite movie ever number one in all time movie list i was a fan of zombie movies and i remember me and my friends talking about what we would do if a zombie outbreak happened and my friend was talking about some of the zombie movies he had seen then the same day we went to the cinema and we saw the preview ofwe couldnt stop laughing at the trailer so me and my friend said minute it comes out we will go see itand damn were we right to see it it was laugh after laugh after laugh and i told my brother about it but he hates zombie movies but i said it was great so he said he would buy it on dvd when it comes out and he loved it as wellit is one of only a few movies i can watch very often you notice something new every time you watch it it is so multilayered and and special shout out to nick frost for his amazing performance,black_comedy
ok when i first saw the previews for this i said oh my god that looks stupid well we ran across it one night on hbo and decided to just watch it for a second because it was just starting within about 10 minutes were were laughing hysterically needless to say we watched the whole thing and have watched it dozens of times since it has become one of our favorite movies the blood and gore are not overdone  there is really only one really nasty scene in the whole movie  it makes you jump and most of all makes you laugh youre not laughing at it you laugh because you are supposed to if you get a chance to see this movie  take it,black_comedy
i bought sotd on dvd way back in 2005 and on valentines day no less and watched it as soon as i got home i instantly fell in love with it and simon pegg i watched it everyday for nearly a montha friend of mine came over tonight to watch a movie and since i hadnt watched it in awhile i convinced them to watch shaun the movie is just as good if not better than the first time i watched it and it was funny as heck screaming at the jumps to scare the crap out of my friendawesome movie and if i must say so myself one of the best zombie movies ive ever seen with the exception of george romeros dawn of the dead of course,black_comedy
is one of those movies that you will find funny even after multiple viewings its packed full of laughs that just keep on coming simon pegg turns in a fantastic performance along with other well known british that appear alongside him if you look closely there are other famous brits in small cameo roles such as matt lucas little britain and tamzin greig green wing the movie has a brief run time of just 93mins which makes it pass surprisingly quickly although this film makes for great viewing its not for the faint hearted as the gore can sometimes bewellvery gory overall is a brilliantly sharp fabulously over the top gorefest of a romantic comedy definitely worth a rent  1010,black_comedy
i have to hand it to creators of this film they manage to combine humor zombies and a story of love and redemption in a way thats very palatable and fun to watch this film is not for the faintofheart because although its primarily a comedy there is a boatload of gore guts and carnage its stylized yet graphic funny yet not necessarily fakelooking the dialogue is quick and usually pretty funny although i didnt find the use of the word gay particularly funny or necessary the plot revolves around a guy who works a deadend job just got dumped by his girlfriend and lives with his lazy deadbeat friend suddenly the recently deceased return from the dead and start preying on the living and he has a chance to redeem himself so he arms himself with a cricket bat his friend gets a shovel and they get down to business there are zombies galore and a lot of humor that will appeal most to the younger high school and college crowd this film is a great homage to george a romeros zombie films among others in fact after seeing the film romero invited edgar wright and simon pegg to play zombies in his land of the dead if you are a fan of the zombie genre you are almost guaranteed to like this film if not there is still a solid chance that you will be entertained but youll miss out on more homages than quentin tarantino can shake a stick at,black_comedy
excellent movie definitely a must see if you love british comedy you will absolutely love this movie not only do you just love every single character in the movie but especially shaun and ed but the soundtrack is really good too youll never catch all of the witty side comments the first time you see the movie i would recommend this movie to anyone the acting is good the storyline is great the comedy  humor is awesome and zombie parts of the movie are really good the only possible negative thing about this movie that i can say is that it definitely is a lower budget movie other than that ive got nothing just see the movie,black_comedy
well okay maybe not in ages i do own braindead and bad taste but stillas you might guess is a member of humorous zombie splatter movie genre in this particularly bloody yet humour lazed horror sub genre sotd isnt the most bloodiest one that would be braindead i think but it does keep you entertained and it does show that you can actually keep the minor problems with the deaders as a background issue while the shaun simon pegg is trying to mend his relationship with his girl liz kate ashfieldthe main question in this genre is how well do the jokes interact with the massacre in this case i may say that i laughed hard in some places and if not out loud then i managed to get a smirk on my face while watchingthe special effects are quite good and while the zombie mask arent from the most imaginative ive seen they work very well i believe that a fans of the genre would find this movie entertaining and i actually think that even the non fans get a couple of chuckles out of it as i said the gore level isnt from the highest end,black_comedy

a very entertaining and very funny film not as funny as expected i had pretty high expectations but very funny especially when shaun is so oblivious to the zombies around him the gore is very satisfying too i loved this movie my brother wasnt all that excited about it but then again he liked night at the museum so ill discard his review the relentless gore made it even funnier i sort of wasnt that bummed when ed died he was kind of annoying anyway although i was surprised that they killed him off i think they thought he was actually funny or somethingyou actually sense something going on with shaun and his babe great acting from simon pegg and kate ashfieldfunny but not very rewatchable7 mauled englishmen out of 10,black_comedy
some movies just perfectly fit one genre so that they finally overwhelm itthis is here the case just as the good the bad and the ugly is more than just the best westernmovie ever uses the symbolics of the zombie invasion as it was used in the first romeros  were all already dead folks as far as modern life is concernedok i promise i wont talk about symbolism anymorethus plus the fact that all of this is done in a really funny and genrerespectful way shaun is something like an impossible crossover between the zmovie and the 30like sitcom with a 30like yo hero stuck in a store selling tv sets alongside with dull acneic teens thinking and telling hes a loserby the time he realizes the world is being invaded by maneating zombies his girlfriend drops him out which seems to be far more uneasy for him to accept than the rest if you add the fact that its always flipping between the rawest comedy and the harshest drama things are beginning to get really good for you viewer as the more you laugh the more the characters get sympathetic and the more you get really touched by what happens to them as opposed for example to the fact that we dont give a fck about whatever happens to neo in matrixthis is a brilliantly efficient way to keep you concerned and surprised from the beginning to the end another trick used to get you wondering what you might do might it happen to you and yes you wonder even if you rationally know that this wont happen is what i call the proximityfx having a hero so ordinary his best friend selling weed and playing vg all day long and a goal twisting between avoiding to be eaten alive and getting the girlfriend backin this category enters something you in the us probably wont feel as much as we do in europe youre used to see your streets filled with dodge and chrysler exploding while being chased by crazymachinegunslinging choppers this is america i saw it on tv but were not and i admit that seeing anyone trying to flee away from a zombiehorde in a red renault megane definitely gives me the creeps as this is one car i may actually use if i ever have to do it myself go and run to your videostore if you hadnt seen it yet as anything in this movie is perfect the whole cast the deadinhisheart employeeofthemonth the bigbielike best friend and his invasive weed business and laziness the very touching mother and fatherinlaw all of the team following shaun and the mirrorteam following his exgirlfriendthe girlfriends friends looking like a grownup and boring harry potter and a living barbie dollas they all fit perfectly written characters the filming watch for the double and mirrored sequence shot in the beginning or the plans to get the girlfriend back the twisted yet classic scenario illuminated with instantcultscenes you dont know yet but a vinyl of sade may actually save your life all of these make this movie an absolute mustseego and get itbuy it rent it or steal it buy popcorn sit well and enjoy alonewith your friendsgirlboyfriend or dog or grandma or anyone you want to have with you when you have a real good timeshaun rocks,black_comedy
since when was a zombie attack funny really now when want to know when when came out thats when this movie takes something as scary as the zombie attack and turns it into a laughyourbuttoff comedy as a fan of the living dead werewolves and zombies and so on and then loving comedy this movie is one of my all time favorites is some one was looking for a good laugh i would totally and will totally recommend this movie this is one of the many movies that you shouldnt knock until youve given it a chance also it a great way to get over any fear of the long feared zombies which are really mindless cannibals if you think it about it,black_comedy
with so many zombie horror movies and so many classics i thought it was about time for a spoof but how would it fairi must admit the first time i watched this movie i wasnt convinced that the film had done its expectations any justice boy was i wrong after the second and third watch and coming to appreciate the excellent humour of simon pegg and nick frost and of course with a spoof you never always notice each funny part i was hookedfortunately we are in the age of the dvd and can witness this laugh a minute movie whenever the feeling takes me with so many funny moments simon peggs timing is impeccable and with the righteously hilarious frost the partnership thriveseven when you know a scene is gong to be funny and you have seen it before you will be quoting and giggling before the scene is outthis film is destined to become a classic which has probably been written on many reviews but the more its written the quicker it becomes one and with so many brilliant american comedies in recent years its just great to see one on our own shores to rival them allthe best comedy in years,black_comedy
this movie is my favorite movie hands down im a big fan of comedies and zombie movies and this movie blended them perfectly george a romeros original version is a classic the remake was not bad either and this movie does it justice i hope that simon pegg and edgar wright team up for even more movies in the future because this was as close to a perfect movie as humanly possible and for those people that disagree with me you obviously dont know what a good movie is because this is without question a good example of one hopefully if these two do team up for another movie they but bruce campbell in it because a good movie just becomes so much better if you add some bruce juice this review is slowly fading out simply because im being forced to write 10 lines,black_comedy
wow i feel like someone just stole 7 bucks from my wallet and another 4 bucks for a pop and popcorn while im a big fan of british films and horror flicks halloween and their parodies scream i just couldnt get into this filmthe acting is fairly solid and i had a few chuckles here or there but it wasnt enough to keep my eyes glued and attention focused on the screen i even left for a wc break and glanced at my watch a few times which isnt typicalthe production value is fairly good no issues with that but the humor is a bit flat and the momentum slows down after the first 40 minutes i think id wait for dvd if i were you,black_comedy
this film killed me i couldnt breathe because of the nonstop laugh this one is better than exorcistspoilersstory begins as shaun simon pegg an average unattractive guy who lives with his buddy ed nick frost and a nonbuddy pete peter serafinowicz gets troubles on the relation with beautiful liz kate ashfield to make the matter worst it all happens when the whole town goes on a strange biological changethat night to cure the broken heart shaun and ed went on a bar to get drunk badly and parties at their apartment next morning shaun wakes up with a new twist in his life he finds that his town changed completely and the people around him is now zombieswhat will he do next will he go back to his ex girlfriend or he better fight for his own survivaldirected by edgar wright from the creation of simon pegg and edgar wright themselves tells a romantic tale set up on the backdrops of zombies they did a great work by smartly blending romance and horror in the story with a touch of humor the big thing i liked most in this movie was its editing wow what a pace cutting experience all the credits goes to chris dickens for his masterful editing also soul for this zombie movie was stunningly created by daniel mudford and pete woodhead under nick angel i liked that heavy cues on attacks furthermore strangely i found the man who did the sound version of my greatest star wars villains darth maul mr peter serafinowicz he looked terrific in the role of pete even better on that zombie version only thing i didnt like in this movie was i think it lacked location recordings and was dubbed by its respected actors even though we get an interesting cinematic tones its a great nice british moviei give this movie 8 out of 10 fun of the joy,black_comedy
i just saw this film a few days ago on videoi dont recall if it ever made it to my hometownit mightve made it to lawrencewhich is 20 plus miles east of hereand was very impressed i found myself drawing comparisons of this show to the remake of dawn of the dead remakewhich came out both in theatre and videodvd relatively close to each other while i liked and was sufficiently entertained by dotd 2004i was more impressed with this effortmostly due to the copious amount of comedy and pathos that gives this zombie flick a little more depthi also enjoyed this ending more than dotdsbut that would be a spoiler if i told you whythe english sensibility of this filmie a lot of arguinga sort of soccerhooligan sensibility to its violencemakes the horror element of this film both real and hilariousno mean feat there the heroshaunyou become familiar with as a basically good guy with low aspirations and a sinking sense of boredom in life his best friendedis a disgusting yet amiable loser and his girlfriendlizmight seem grating and prattling on first observationbut she is basically kind and sensiblea perfect foil for shaun the fact that zombies are taking over london slowly sinks inand isnt helped by the fact thatand this bit i have no doubt was the filmmakers tongueincheek jab at londonbritish urban lifestylemany locals are already lethargicslowmovinginarticulate sorts there is much confusion over who is undead and who is merely drunk in this filmand there are some great visual similarities between the undead and shaun himself by the time it is eminently clear that londonperhaps all of england and maybe even the worldis being overtaken by the walking deadit becomes a fullon race and struggle for survival par for the course therethe signature of any ordinary film of this genre but the way the principal characters react to the situation and each other is both very palpableaggravatingit doesnt dawn on them until about 23 of the way through the film that they should shoot the zombies in the headand funny the ending may seem a bit of a copout for somebut it fits the rhythm of the movie as it was set uphorrorcomedies are rareand im ready to give a rhetorical beatdown to the next person who thinks the scream movies are parodies the scary movie films areand probably somewhat difficult to make i suppose love at first bite or american werewolf in london might be considered examples but this film is able to balance the scaresgore and other conventions of thriller flicks with  daffypratfall comedyand that makes this film very special the amount of pop music references and usagequeen in particularis something that sealed the deal for me i probably wouldve voted a 95 for this onesince i dont really fancy myself a horror movie aficionadobut since you cannot vote like that on imdbso i rounded up,black_comedy
im a bit of a zombie purist dawn of the dead is one of my top 10 favorites film i love the cinematography and the irony of the ambulatory corpses shuffling around the shopping center as is their old habit but the recent glut of zombie film depicts them as steroidenraged track stars drooling blood they move so fast whenever one is killed or merely shot the camera zooms in so fast you dont see the impact saves the big budget film some bucks on squibs i guess but also it lacks imagination you can always add the whiz and growl effects in postwell thank the producers of for not only giving the zombies a plausible pacing but making them memorable personality wise in dawn you have the helicopter zombie the machete victim many more when shaun goes to the deli shop for the first time you get the outlay of the neighborhood with all the familiar characters he sees everyday in almost the same spot to name a few the soccer playing kid the jamaican guy washing his car the panhandler the indian grocery owner the onearmed guy in the blue tuxif you listen to the commentary track youll find that every zombie character appears in an earlier scene in a living state all in all the film was great funny action packed and only slightly ironic,black_comedy
this movie is for people who want a genuine funny and a movie the makes you warm and fuzzy inside and this is it except with zombies simon pegg and edgar write have a brilliant on screen comic chemistry showing how carp crap life can be sometimes but telling you to look ahead things can get better the characters are portrayed brilliantly highly recommended movie lucy davis from the office shows enthusiasm in the role and she should be proud of her performance so should all the others as well bill nighy plays his role as the dodgy step dad with strength and is kinda freaky when he pops up unexpected the guy who plays david should get a pat on the back he was so funny and genuineeverone in the movie deserves so much recongnition vernon kay has a cameo and looks really good as an added bonus a must see should have won the best move oscar deserves it 100 fabulous and for what the budget was really good costumes loved the movie,black_comedy
there are movies like army of darkness that poke fun at themselves and get some laughs along the way there are movies like scary movie that pretty much play out as a long sequence of gross jokes but then there are the very rare films like that belittle entire genres of movies while still showing life of their own creativity and a kind of weirdness that cant help but entertaingives us shaun a hero of all heroes who must save the world from zombies that bite people to turn them into zombies themselves shauns tragic flaw is his friend ed who pretty much sits around all day and does nothing but he and ed need to rescue shauns mom and stepdad and shauns exgirlfriend and her flatmates none of the performances are especially dramatic but all actors in both major and supporting roles do quite a good jobeverything is done in jest with kind of an obviously feigned seriousness that makes the film all the more hilarious also a brilliant comparison near the beginning of the film gives it creative flavor and strikes interest with the viewer the characters reactions to the zombies especially the reactions of shaun and ed are very similar to the reactions of regular characters in zombie films but satirical enough to draw many laughs there are some specific scenes that stand out as especially creative and bizarre but they must be viewed for full effectthe direction then by edgar wright isnt earthshattering but its adequate for the subject matter and i personally enjoyed the nonoriginal music selections at place in the film the films strongest point is its screenplay but it does contain some confusion for the viewer for instance there are certain points in the film that approach the realm of the sentimental and the viewer cannot figure out whether whats on screen is meant to be viewed jokingly or meant to evoke sympathy for these brilliant characters and even though the film is very very funny there are lines especially those that make use of scatological humor that are very not funny and leave a sour taste in the viewers mouthyet this movie entertains almost to its full potential dont watch if youre looking for something profound or classic but definitely take in a viewing of if youre looking for a comedy thats pretty smart and often hilarious and creativefinal grade b,black_comedy
the movie was everything i expected my the comedy was outstanding the movie excelled at being pure entertainment the movie never stopped surprising me sometimes during previews for a movie they completely give away the best scenes however the scenes during the trailer evolved differently than i suspected the only problem i had was that the feel of the movie took a much too long serious turn toward the movie when they went to the bar i was hoping the movie would continue to the end without being clich but this scene proved otherwise aside from this issue the rest of the movie was great i especially enjoyed the performance by nick frosted his delivery was priceless worthseeing by anyone who enjoys comedy at its finest,black_comedy
is one of the funniest zombie movies ive ever seen shaun who is retail worker and ed who stays home all day fight zombies and saving shauns girlfriend mom and others to ensure their future survival simon pegg and edgar wright took their written cues from the original dawn of the dead movie dubbed rom com and zom i recommend this movie on dvd and watch for pegg and wrights cameo appearance in romeros new living dead movie series call land of the dead simon said in an interview about other zombie movie during the jimmy kimmel show quoting about 28 days later to 28 coffees in which these zombies were drinking too much coffee going after the living anyone for a drink,black_comedy
this was one of those films that sneaks up on you jaded by endless inferior sequels and remakes i approached this film with some trepidation but was pleasantly surprised night of the living dead ripoffs are so common one often has an aversion to parodies of this sort which have become a genre of their own nevertheless this is a goodnatured satire which this viewer found very entertaining the characters are quirky without being bizarre and there is a good deal of amusing selfparody  for instance having one of the characters improbably exclaim were going to get you barbara referencing one of living deads most wellknown lines all in all a nice twist on a horror theme that is in danger of petrifying itself out of existence,black_comedy
as a zombie movie this easily beats dawn of the dead the characters are more developed and you care about them more its not just people dying left and right and the people arent dumb except those who are supposed to be but they are realistic seeing that guy being ripped apart by zombies would satisfy some craving for gore which beat dotd and there was a wider range of weapons as for the comedy angle there were a few laughs and the movie was enjoyable to watch its not hilarious but its good the overall quality of the movie was good including acting music and camera work i recommend this movie for anyone who likes some comedy or zombie movies,black_comedy
im by no means an expert on zombie movies hell 28 days later was the first one i saw and it failed to make a great impression on zombie movies as a whole however when i saw dawn of the dead earlier this year i had a permanent respect for the genre i have since seen the original night of the living dead and plan to see day of the dead and the original dawn of the dead was i ready for a zombie spoof though i knew a few spoofs would go over my head but looked like a pretty funny movie so why not plot 142 despite some people saying this movie uses zombies as backdrop it is a zombie movie through and through this isnt a romantic comedy with zombies its a zombie movie with romantic elements that being said shaun does have a sufficient plot for a nobrainer zombie comedy shaun pegg is a 29 year old loser he works at a job with highschoolers his girlfriend liz ashfield dumped him because of him being unreliable he is the constant mediator between his flatmates the workaholic pete serafinowicz and useless penniless ed frost he also sees his mother barbara wilton very rarely and hates his stepdad phillip nighy thats his life before it happens it started a night after shaun and ed got wasted to forget about liz shaun has set a goal to get liz back see his mother and set his life in order when ed finds a girl moping around their backyard when ed and shaun investigate they find out she is trying to bite them and she can live through having a metal pole shoved through her stomach soon a couple more like her arrive they watch tv to find out that there is an epidemic of crazed behaviour the attackers will not stop barbaric cannibalism unless their brain is neutralized in other words zombism after finding that pete has been bitten shaun and ed make a plan to pick up barbara and liz also ending up taking phillip and lizs flatmates twat thats the word they use david moran and failed actress dianne davis they decide the best place to hole up is eds favourite pub the winchester the rest of the movie is what happens once they are in the winchester for a movie that combines the two genres comedy and horror that are often the most stupid the plot of is about as good as anyone could expect its not a twisty one very linear but simple enough to be an easy watch but not seem stupidcomedy 182 this movie is british humour at its best whether its eds utter incompetence or shauns zombie denial sotd is one funny movie the only problem is its not everyones type of comedy british comedy isnt for everyone there is some bits that are really inyourface such as orchestrated zombie beating or the final newsreel montage but there are many more subtle bits also some of the bits are there for people who rewatch the movie to make connections as there is a lot of foreshadowing that is hilarious the second time if this is your type of comedy this is your type of movie with zombies it also helps to have at least some knowledge of zombie movies or else many references and spoofs will go over your headhorror 162 for a movie based mainly on comedy is extremely gory it is probably gorier than kill bill volume two or dawn of the dead maybe even the passion as much as i like gore it does not add much to the horror factor while many scenes are frightening shaun doesnt attempt to be a horror movie out and out the aforementioned scene involving an orchestrated zombie beating could have been scary as hell without pool cues and queen what it does attempt is done very well so i give it credit hereacting 192 i thought the acting was very good simon pegg was a great shaun moran whom ive seen on just for laughs before was excellent as david and lets not forget bill nighy underworld as the stepdad phillip nick frost didnt do an excellent job but he was the scene stealer granted any actor on a halfdecent day could pull off that feat with the material he had another special mention to penelope wilton who i thought played a great barbaraentertainment 172 it all depends if you like this type of humour if you like british humour even though this isnt as outlandish as monty python you will like this if you are a zombie movie fan you will like this exclude those two things and this is not your type of moviebonus 1 for this ed plays none other than timesplitters 2 throughout the movie i almost fell off my couch for those who are nongamers ts2 is the best splitscreen multiplayer game ever created on this generation and its on all three major systems seeing this game here just made me smile its does have some zombies in it so its not completely out of place but i would think something like resident evil would be more appropriatetotal 85 is simply hilarious so i highly recommend it for those who like this kind of humour and mildly recommend for those who dont its also great for the gore aficionado on your list it is one that i personally am going to buy so it is one that i believed was good enough to own see,black_comedy
okay so a lot of us have seen dawn of the dead old and new night of the living dead day of the dead resident evil and any other number of zombie films right so when you hear the term funny associated with zombie you think oh its a spoof quite the opposite is true ofwhile one of the ambitions of the film makers is clearly to poke fun its not picking fun at zombie movies but rather at society as a whole they ask questions like how much would really change if the world was overtaken by zombies and how long would it take the average guy to notice with excellent performances from a virtually unknown cast and filmmakers who are driven by multiple viewings of george romeros classics is an excellently good time from start to finish the barrel of laughs provided by the two main characters simon pegg and nick frost added to an average love story which just happens to include zombies produces the sort of movie youre never likely to see again and are certain to enjoywill an invasion of zombies change the way we live forever probably not,black_comedy
george romeros american homegrown zombie franchise  night of the living dead 1969 dawn of the dead 1978 and a somewhat tepid remake in 2004 and day of the dead 1981  has spawned dozens of imitations sendups and downright ripoffs but none as cleverly tongueincheek as this new british entryshaun is a disenfranchised peter pan idling away the last moments of his twenties living with roommates hanging out at his local pub and working a menial retail job he and his friends dont seem to notice the evergrowing army of reanimated flesheaters instead being absorbed in their interpersonal relationships and romances only when circumstances grow dire and demand action do they reluctantly formulate a planin addition to this display of largescale apathy the film boasts hilarious dialog welldeveloped and competently acted characters and literally hundreds of tips of the hat to george romeros shambling remnants of western civilization for fans of the genre i highly recommend this one,black_comedy
what a beautiful spin off of dawn of the dead the first 34 of the movie was an ab workout the final 14 things started to tone down but overall this movie was well worth the cost of admission great choice and now i have to enter a bunch more lines or i cant submit my comment done and now i have to enter a bunch more lines or i cant submit my comment done and now i have to enter a bunch more lines or i cant submit my comment done and now i have to enter a bunch more lines or i cant submit my comment done and now i have to enter a bunch more lines or i cant submit my comment done and now i have to enter a bunch more lines or i cant submit my comment done and now i have to enter a bunch more lines or i cant submit my comment done,black_comedy
this movie is hands down hilarious not only that its an amazing movie simply because although it is categorized as a comedy it cuts across several other genres and collaborates them beautifully a comedy a horrorzombie flick an action movie a drama a britflick and finally believe it or not a romantic comedy yes to everyone in the uk a lot of us here actually consider a britflick a genre to put it this way my girlfriend who doesnt like bloody horror flicks action flicks or british movies actually admitted she liked it after i put her through it it incorporates all the elements of these categories and knows exactly when to bring out each i agree with what another poster has said that it is amazingly realistic for the kind of movie that it is meaning the characters react to the situations the way normal people do for the most part there are no real heroes shaun himself does nothing truly amazing except for be himself and try his best to keep his loved ones alive i could watch this movie again and again and for me its rare to say that about a comedy,black_comedy
i remember going to see resident evilapocalypse and i saw the trailer for this movie me and my friend where laughing for the whole trailer unfortunately i wasnt old enough to purchase a ticket to see it i was so excited when that same friend bought it when i finally sat down and watched it i loved it instantly its an excellent movie and very funny if you like scary movie youll love this movie i give it a 910 the problem with it i think was it got sort of sad at the end when your expecting comedy the beginning and middle is the best part like when they were choosing which records to throw i wont ruin it but wait until the fence scene,black_comedy
i never would have rented this film if it werent for the blockbuster gift card i received for christmas i am so glad that i did i was surprised at my attachment to the characters towards the end and i realized what a wellbalanced split there was between character development and plot climax humor and horror love and sadness the gore was conservative for what it could have been and didnt at all interfere with the flow or progress the characters were believable although they did quickly and gleefully take up the bloodlust necessary to dispatch zombies they still acted in a reasonably disgusted manner the comedy was superb although i sometimes felt that they were using that british accent to accentuate the comedy if the same things were said with an american accent it wouldnt have been as funny all the same i laughed much more than i expected and said this is great out loud more than once throughout the film plus any film where two main characters sing grandmaster flashs white lines would get a score of at least 7 from me even if the rest of the movie was about a mute woman who teaches harvey keitel to play the piano,black_comedy
there are no words to rightfully describe how amazing this picture is if you are a fan of british comedies then this is one you have got to see very dry humor but had me rolling the entire time well thought out enough gags and laughs to make anyone enjoy this film and guys dont worry your girlfriend will enjoy it too as there are manyemotional points as well cant wait to see what they have for us next they totally picked up on the stereotypical brit and their interactions great fight scenesand really look at the weapons its hilarious the dvd extras fill in some plot holes although not all of them are complete but again you dont even miss them great all around flick as they say about guinnessits funking brilliant,black_comedy
ok i heard about this film on the radio i heard roamers that it was funny but the title makes it sound more like a camp film i never would have seen it however my son 17 rented it and made me watch it since we love bruce campbells movies he knew i would like it i laughed my bumoff everyone must see this film horror or comedy i loved it the plot shows that anyone is able to take a stand and show leadership you might lose a few friends on the way and maybe a relative or two but it never hurts to try and remember to keep your friends in the end because video games are always better with a friend join in now player two has joined,black_comedy
so youve seen every zombie movie known to man as i have this is toprate musical soundtrack is bent towards the british audience with a few uk stars thrown in around the cast there is not a moment to lose in the far flung take on the travails of life love roommates and the end of the world even with the sappy happy ending the hilarious visual parallels between the 95 working stiffs and the blood thirsty plot you will find yourself charmed and rooting for the boyish naivete of the main character and his desire for the simple life with his girlwithout giving any great plot twist away there is nothing wrong with mixing middle class boredom go nowhere job blues angst pub crawling and gory zombie violence to the language of the cinemaenjoy this one with extra onions or hot butter,black_comedy
edgar wrights is not only the best horror film of 2004 but it is the best comedy as well it is an often hilarious tribute to george a romeros 1978 horror masterpiece dawn of the dead this film is not only horrifying at times it also manages to be quite funny the acting is very good across the board the lead was an ideal choice the script is clever there are many sly references to other horror films the makeup and gore effects are topnotch comparable to tom savinis work for romeros zombie films this film is on my top ten list for 2004 any fan of horror will appreciate this film for its smart script 12 out of  and 910 highly recommended,black_comedy

ahhhh the rare and oft misunderstood zombiecomedy genre at its absolute best i went into this movie hoping it would be awesome but expecting it to be drivel not familiar with the sitcom spaced at the time but left with a feeling a movie has not given me since heck i dont even remember a movie making me feel quite like this this is what a good movie is all about it contains everything it needs and very little it doesnt ie  youve got red on your shirt  was a little overused and not that funny while understandably the occasional scene of dismemberment and foul mouthed cursing may turn away many comedy fans this movie was not intended for those people this movie was intended for people who could appreciate the humor in films such as evil dead 2 or dead alive what this movie does is escalate every good aspect of those aforementioned movies to a new degree that i feel will be difficult to surpass launching it right up there with monty python and the holy grail as on of the best british comedic movies ever created  and quite possibly one of the best comic movies ever made regardless of nationality while having a deep understanding of british culture helps anyone with an iq of over 100 should find this movie extremely entertaining i nearly wet myself from laughing so hard throughout the movie although it does sort of drag near the end as everyone dies off but it is miraculously saved by a heartwarming and very funny ending that couldnt have been done any better its upsetting that the movie didnt gross more in the states although im sure once word of mouth gets around dvd sales and rentals will pick up im an extremely critical movie buff and this movie has permanently carved a notch in my top ten films of all time if youre at all skeptical  dont be if youre 1360 a very cool 60 youll find something that will appeal to you in this movie although i suspect its biggest fan base will be men in their 20s to early 30s i cannot stress the importance of this film as it is now the king of all horrorcomedy films even if the horror aspect doesnt appeal to you the comedy is solid and if you dont find yourself laughing at least a few times throughout then i seriously doubt youre even human i give this the highest recommendation possible its a story about friendship love senseless violence and gutbusting scenes of pure joy watch it and youll know what mean,black_comedy
when i first saw the trailer for shaun i thought it was a spoof but after watching it i realised that it is so so so much more the film works on so many levels which is the main reason i like it so much on one level it is an excellent zombie film with some of the best special effects in the genre the zombies are perfect the blood isnt overkill or suggestive but a perfectly gory balance between horrific and subtle with this the climactic sequence is tense scary and effective where it could have easily failed if it were helmed by another director another level the film works at is its fine grasp of comedy of course this is for many the main attraction and the spaced comparisons are inevitable yes its like spaced no it isnt better but it isnt worse either where spaced was a surreal fanboy orientated sitcom shaun is a lesssurreal fanboy orientated romcom spaced wouldnt have worked as a film because it is written in episodes and is to hectic however shaun is set at a different pace with more realistic settings and characters the fanboy homages are still there references to raimi and romero are excellently handled but this time round edger wrights direction has matured and he has made his own style from his influences now rather than ripoff camera work we have subtle inserts which are fun for everyone and mean that little bit more to those in the know the film also showcases some fine scripting performances and acting as well as some astonishing set pieces there are spoofy moments such as the queenpool battle and the ambitious use of vinyl as a zombie deterrent but the film isnt just a spoof reel like scary movie or hot shots is in its own right a classic horror comedy simon pegg and nick frosts double act of shaun and ed is inspired and touching and even outdoes tim and mike their roles in spaced nick frosts ed is so good because he is so real hes such an honest portrayal of the best mate who you cant quite let go hes also wonderfully politically incorrect with lines like wassup niggas and alrightgay which could easily offend but dont because they are so effectively delivered theres no doubt that no harm is meantoverall is bloody fantastic and i recommend it to all i give it a nine out of ten it loses a point because i feel it slightly lacks the feeling of alienation and apocalyptic atmosphere of the romero greats but is so effective never the less i dont really care,black_comedy
is pretty mediocre flick in the beginning ive seen so much of standard british sitcom humor that it failed to impress but once the zombies started causing havoc the film became really funny and entertaining it was cool to see the film not shying away from all the gore good throwback to the old days when horror movies had some guts its pretty well directed with some cool camera angels and stuff like that and i really liked the actors especially shaun and ed were really goodthe first 2030 minutes are kinda boring but its really good after that i would give the film ,black_comedy
first let me say that generally i do not find simon pegg funny generally i tend to rate most of his comic characters only slightly above mr bean but having said that this film is a very refreshing comedyhorror flick it is like an updated hammer house of horror though with fewer heaving breasts there are a whole bunch of little visual jokes that really make this film as well as the character interactioni would recommend this film to everyone over about 15 yes there is quite a bit of comic violence but what you just have to have it in this sort of flick it was not a film that made me laugh out loud very often but it definitely kept me entertained i am just glad they did not remake it in the us yet with a baseball bat substituted for the cricket bat  although either would be equally effective,black_comedy
considering that the british tend to have a pretty good sense of humor i was a tiny bit disappointed with this movie it was pretty funny but most of it was in a drawnout understated way which is not a bad thing but here it wasnt really very clever either for me there were only a few laughoutloud moments the joke factor was no more than sosoas usual with these movies its the characterization of the main characters that is the interesting part and in this movie there were some nice elements of that too but it was a too obvious secondfiddle aspect because ultimately everyone but the hero and his girl died i hoped that david would end up with liz and shaun with dianne oh well6 out of 10,black_comedy
if you see only one zombie romantic comedy this should be it its a perfect complement to or substitute for depending on your outlook 28 days later or dawn of the dead the two most recent zombie moviesshaun simon pegg is a salesman at a small electronics store he lives with flatmates ed nick frost and pete peter serafinowicz and hangs out with his girlfriend liz kate ashfield at the local pub the winchester shauns life is pretty stagnant at this point hes 28 but directionless liz notices this problem and tells him to take a hike after shaun bungles the reserving of a table for dinner dazed shaun gets drunk at the winchester with ed its not until after a few days of their bender that shaun and ed notice the walking deadthe zombies are more or less a metaphor for shauns life to that point that hes just drifting from experience to experience without actually making anything of himself he likes ed but he cant rely on him as a friend ed is also jobless no one else in his social circle can stand ed lizs flatmates dont like shaun too much because they think he neglects her but shaun isnt dislikable hes just not all that therethe arrival of the living dead  their genesis is never explained but its moot  gives shaun a chance to show hes not some senseless slacker whod rather play video games or hang around in a pub and its at this point that the movie mirrors the earlier moreserious zombie films as he and his friends try to escape the clutches of the zombiesshauns personality doesnt change drastically however its not as if hes suddenly transformed into indiana jones he makes mistakes but one thing is certain  shaun he appears full of life and confidence inspiring his followers to  well to followgoing from the promos one would think this was full of nonstop laughs now there were plenty of moments when i did laugh out loud but a lot of the movie  especially the final 30 minutes or so  is fairly serious lighter than your usual runofthemill livingdead movie but not a hilarious film full of wacky hijinks in some respect that may have hurt the movie a little  people crack jokes when it seems more drama would be in order and some of the characters are pretty darn unlikeable and that never helps unless theyre definitely the bad guys,black_comedy
i went into watching this film not knowing too much about it i was originally expecting a pure comedy but thats not what it iswhile is predominantly a spoof of dawn of the dead it does touch on a variety of different topics in a semiserious waythe title character shaun is a 29 year old stuck in a dead end job supervising teenage coworkers he cant seem to get it right with his girlfriend liz and he never goes to visit his motherwhat makes this movie hilarious is that it took an apocalyptic event for shaun to get his life in gear while that doesnt sound funny it surely is made funny by simon peggs performance as shaungreat dialog a new twist on a common horror theme and a little seriousness thrown in make this a great film i wouldnt take anyone squeamish to go see it but all violence is made to look obviously fake and is done in a slapstick mannercatch this one when you can its spectacular,black_comedy
delivers exactly what it promises its a zombie movie so theres gore a bit of horror some action and did i mention gore its a comedy about the daily grind and about going life as a zombie made for the sort of people who watch zombie movies while doesnt contain the same sort of gore and trauma inducing splatter as either of the dawn of the dead movies i would venture that if you didnt enjoy those and if you didnt think that idle hands was funny then youre not going to enjoy this one either for fans of the horror genre looking for a well made and interesting comedic take on the recent spate of zombie movies though this is one not to miss,black_comedy
i am not a huge fan of the british comedies even though that is my nationality i dont mind them but i feel there is more fun to be had watching an american film such as south park or the naked gun and then along came my views were completely shifted first thing ive just got to say is what a film youve simply got to see this and if you havent already make sure you rent it or even buy in the near future its tense fun and so so funny one of the great things about the film is although you may have seen these actors on tv elsewhere ie the office or spaced its there first proper time acting on a set and they do so so well impeccably timing as if theyd being doing this for 25 years another great aspect is how they blend the different genres together theres horror in the pub sounded out by bellowing laughs theres romance beforehand topped off with utter stupidity so really this film is just one genre it effortlessly manages to be about three or four and its done so damn well the garden scene is so outrageously funny really this is essential viewing and if you want to see arguably the funniest british comedy ever that can be watched over and over again then go anywhere you can to purchase this immediatelyoverall  out of  4 and a half out of 5,black_comedy
is a great film but it starts a little too slowlyit tells the story of shaun a man who breaks up with his girlfriend at the beginning of the film and soon realises that his life is slipping hes stuck in a dead end job he needs to visit his mum but his stepdad the ever brilliant bill nighy is there with his beloved jaguar car and his house mate pete is sick of shauns best friend ed then the dead start to come back to lifethe film starts slowly with his normal life but gains speed halfway through there are lots of good jokes at the beginning but soon there are less and less but admittedly though there are less the jokes towards the end of the film are generally betterthe zombies in this film are very good with white eyes and visible wounds where they were attacked when they were living by zombies by the way you may not want to watch this at least not some of it if you are afraid of gore as you do see some people get ripped apartif you enjoy which you most likely will i recommend spaced which is a tv show written and starring most of the same peopleoverall is a great film which is well worth a try if you like comedy in general,black_comedy
shaun combines great direction great acting by a perfect cast great script and great editing the sound editing is firstrate too sure theres gore  its a zombie movie but there are also just the right amount of scary makeyouwetyourpants moments its way better than the current remake of dawn of the dead which i saw the night before watching this that movie was silly and selfindulgent shaun is wellcrafted  it actually has subtext this movie works on so many levels the brit accents can be thick watch on dvd so you dont miss a single funny line also look for wonderfully funny sight gags going on in the background like bubba hotep this is worth buying  destined to be a cult classic,black_comedy
i rented the dvd of last night and found it very entertaining the story is very clear and it moves at a brisk pace even though there are references galore to other movies to tv shows and to the world of pop culture in general the film makers obviously arent using the references as a substitute for storytelling the acting is very good the characters are welldefined and theres a sense of reality in the midst of the unreality while refers often to george a romeros night of the living dead and dawn of the dead the two scenes with shaun taking a trip to the store are reminiscent of monty pythons skit a day in the life of a london stock broker for a comedy to tip the hat so blithely to something so masterful is a bold move but it works well references to british pop personalities eluded me but i dont think thats a flaw its helped me learn a little more about the uk two of the main characters look like harry potter and britney spears on a date and that will make audiences laugh worldwide the dvd itself is full of extras there are two commentary tracks one features the director and the star and the other features a bunch of the cast members there are outtakes flubbed lines and extended versions of peripheral bits seen on tv screens at different times in the movie there is in night of the living dead a moment when suddenly were reminded of the actual horrors of the world at the time the movie was made its a brief moment and may not even have been intended as the jolt it always is but its part of what made that movie powerful has such a moment equally brief so its not just a comedy or a spoof its in a direct line with night of the living dead,black_comedy
is a rarity a film that spoofs other films and then becomes something more right now theres too many indie filmmakers who are making spoofs of horror films to a disadvantage theyre never as clever as the film they are supposed to be making fun of im not just talking about the scary movie series but all the straighttovideo crap thats supposed to be funny and just isnt goes so far beyond mere satire that its an excellent horror film period thats because the script my simon pegg and edgar wright is not only selfaware injokes like references to 28 days later and of course were coming to get you barbara will have horror geeks in stitches but it takes itself seriously theyre smart enough to know a onejoke movie cant be sustained for 2 hours i was afraid that it would since the joke is how shaun is walking around surrounded by real zombies and theyre no different from the regular zombielike living people who live there but they develop key secondary characters and  no spoilers promise  you really care about them when one of them dies you see them as real people and their deaths arent played for laughs you feel like an actual person is dying even if its because a zombie bit them well done chapsthe best thing about the dvd which i got for christmas just in time is that you can turn on close captioning to see what the hell these people are saying i saw the film in the theater and missed half of the dialog because the british accents were too strong call me a stupid yank but i dont think im alone here thats why its a big bonus along with all the other great dvd extras most of which i havent looked at yet,black_comedy
i admit ive never seen a zombie movie before this one ive seen parts of them but people being graphically torn to shreds by the whiteeyed undead generally leaves me cold and slightly disgusted however i love this movie its my second favorite movie of the year and i must say simon pegg your performance was 80 of what i loved about it you are now my favorite comedy actor periodthis movie has proved to me an inkling ive had for a while now  that the best directors get their starts making zombie films peter jackson sam raimi what is it that these guys get that so many other directors do not or maybe i should be asking myself why the hell dont i like zombie films when all my favorite directors adore themto those of you who dont like zombie flicks definitely give this movie a try and have an extra pair of underwear handy when you watch it d,black_comedy
is one of three zombie films that i have seen in my life 28 days later and dawn of the dead the remake are the other two sotd is probably the film that i like the least out of these three that doesnt mean that i think sotd is bad quite the contrary i think its rather good it is funny entertaining and at times gory what makes me say that it is only rather good then well i think the first 30 minutes or so border on boring there are definitely a few laughs but nothing more however from the moment shaun and ed realise something is horribly wrong the movie works on all levels some scenes are hilarious like the one where ed and shaun discuss which records to throw at the zombies while the zombies are walking towards them and some scenes are actually quite touchingtoo bad about the slow beginning but in the end it turned out to be a very entertaining film 710,black_comedy
every morning with our lives in a rut we all wake up and go about some sort of an interminable daily routine showering eating breakfast going to work its all part of some chronic tedious spiel eventually we all become mindless zombies following our habitual lives without even the slightest thought the question is what exactly would we do if our incessant worlds were turned upsidedown if for once something different occurred well according to edgar wrights the answer to that question is simple wed laugh about itwhile poking fun at the british culture and the faults of many perfunctory societies acts as a campy english take on the recently stupefied horror genre it starts out slow setting the grounds for its multilayered characters and plot then jests its way into an elongated and quite riveting climaxthe movie follows the story of an oblivious slacker named shaun simon pegg whos life falls apart when his girlfriend liz kate ashfield dumps him due to his indolent nature the next day shaun and his halfwitted best friend ed nick frost awaken to find the world overrun by the cannibalistic undead from here on out the plot becomes an amusing and largely witty piece of comedic satire as our heroes struggle to save liz her uptight roommates and shauns mother then reach a nearby pub where they plan to take refuge and hopefully survive the nightunlike in most horror films where cardboard cutout characters run around getting chopped to pieces survival and suspense in actually takes a backseat to character development and well romance as shaun uses the apocalypse to his advantage and tries to win back lizs heart heck the movies tagline is even a romantic comedy with zombiesdont get me wrong though even with its many affectionate and comedic moments also packs enough scares to get any horror fan excited the balance between comedy and horror in this film is virtually flawless acting largely as the movies greatest achievementfor example during the last halfhour of this film in which hoards of the undead finally invade our heroes sanctuary a pub initiating an action packed endall battle for survival people are impaled ripped apart and eaten as a jukebox plays quirky pop music and ironically important fart jokes pop up into the atmosphere one second youll be smiling and the next your eyes will be scrunched closed in fear and disgustis also very successful in its constant mocking of the drudgingly humdrum aspects of society initially taunting only the british culture it is a british film after all the movie ends up making fun of anyone and everyone who can connect with the idea of being in a rutone scene in particular that emphasizes this point and actually defines the tone of the movie as a whole would be one in which shaun wakes up goes outside walks to a local convenient store for breakfast and goes back to his house all without realizing that the city of london is up in chaos as hundreds of corpses and moaning fleshhungry zombies line the bloody streets obliviousness and laziness these two things make society as a whole almost indistinguishable from the living deadall in all is a smart scary hilarious and horrifyingly witty satire that constantly teases the everyday lives of people across the globe after reading this review i suggest that you go out find a cricket bat or any blunt object for that matter get to a theater and see this movie oh yeah and one more thingaim for their headsrating 455,black_comedy
i nearly wet myself laughing when i watched this film it already starts off promising in a very oddly british kind of way completely different from what i imagined shaun is this sad geezer on the verge of losing his girlfriend who is stuck in a deadend sales job and gets wound up by his 17 yearold colleagues his best friend is even more of a loser than he is and doesnt do much apart from sitting around with his playstation or downing pints at the local with shaun etc as the plot builds up we are gradually introduced to shauns cozy yet boring world as well as realise way before he does that something very obviously iffy is going on and the scene where shaun  ed finally realise that they are dealing with zombies has got to be one of the most hilarious in the film from that point on shaun the antihero and ed his sidekick become humanitys last hope wellfor his loved ones anyway and both set off on a mission to save shauns exgirlfriend and mother what follows is a mixture of action gore a little romantic subplot and plenty of british humour this is not really a film for those expecting homage to the original but it does have references even in the way its filmed but it is mainly a comedy not a spoof and very good one at that with a brilliant set of characters including lucy davis from the office who plays dianne i also think that its funny that they released at the same time as the remake of dawn of the dead because it shows that a little clever marketing good actors and a good script can take on a big budget remake any day,black_comedy
such witty  intelligent humor throughout this gem of a horror comedy as well as some very good touches on love  friendship liberally sprinkled with nods winks and references to george romeros films and other horror movies its critical acclaim is well deserved not everything worked for methe game showzombieaidetc stuff at the very end for example  but this film hits its marks practically 100 of the rest of the time in factits so packed with sight gags and sharp funny dialogue that one viewing cant do it justice the outtakes on the dvd are very funny and well worth watching,black_comedy
in the ads for this film it claims it is a romantic comedy  with zombies and i for one couldnt agree morethis film is at the core a feature length spaced episode with a bit of good old cheap zombie gore and some silly predictable romance thrown in and as all the spaced episodes were extremely funny it stars simon pegg leading actor from spacedwho is always very funny in anything but in this film he excels himself he acts the part perfectly with an almost oscar winning performanceis not i repeat not a spoof on zombie films it is as the makers say a comedy with zombies the comedy has a small well earned break whenever gore or certain scenes of disenbowlment and decapatation ocurr this film for all you film geeks out there remains true to all the other zombie movies and contains a certain amount of respect for themit is also very clever its message is that we are already all zombies the entire point of the film apart from making anyone who sees it laugh there head of is to make this comment on todays society the film contains numerous witty quotes from other films the actors all give brilliant performances which makes an already sure fire classic even better 1010,black_comedy
hard to describe this as a horror film because its rarely horrifying but its easy to describe it as successful because it has a very polished script and is smartly directedin a modern london suburb a regular bloke who is having girlfriend troubles begins to notice that his neighbors and colleagues are walking funny and talking like they have dirt in their mouthsafter dispatching a zombie girl with an expertly swung cricket bat our hero does what we expect him to do  he heads for the pub on the way he meets plenty of dead people and a few live folks too not that theres much difference here which is the whole pointthe encounters with the deadheads are inventive and marginally bloody but mostly theyre fun in a monty python kind of waytongues are planted firmly in cheeks in this refreshingly unpretentious outing and famous zombie movies  romeros dawn of the dead in particular  are referenced visually and musicallysolid entertainment,black_comedy
romantic comedy zombies humor it would seem a strange combination were it not for the fact that it was done by the same people who made spaced one of the three best british sitcoms ever the others being father ted and black books the tv series was great im surprised a lot of people here didnt watch it anyway the film is very funny at the same time it is not a mere spoof of the genre having realistic zombies not that i ever saw one myself but you know what i mean and some moments that are almost scary good supporting cast too id only like jessica stevenson to have a bigger role shes funny too bad here i lived in london but im living in brazil right now they didnt release it in the cinemas going directly to videodvd instead theyre showing the awful and humorless exorcist the beginning in several theaters shame,black_comedy
mild spoiler is a great british comedythe story it has a great storyline and considering the situation they are all in it is pretty realistic 810 visualsspecial effects good special effects such as a man getting his guts and intestines ripped out and the zombies look really good as well 8510 acting superb acting by all 1010 this film is a almost flawless film that could be watched over and over again it has some great memorable things in it with will make you laugh for agesby the way its not scary at all,black_comedy
this film is possibly my favourite film the editing complements a very fast paced script that never really lets up there is never a dull moment not even when shuan and co are held up in the winchester comedy seems to drip from everysingle pore of this film yet it works on so many levels its a love story when shuans only motivation for trying to save his family and friends stems for his love for liz and his attempts to get back together with her shuan of the dead works very well as an action film where the zombies storm the winchester while the survivors try and fend them off with molitov cocktails and a rifle and it also works as a bloody good zombie film with brilliant make up and amazing extras one of them actually dislocated his ankle just to get a more authentic zombie look if you havent seen shuan of the dead yet you need a bloody goodexcuseoh yeah the soundtrack is excellent too,black_comedy
i am not a fan of horror films and had never seen spaced  so i was a little apprehensive about going to see this however as a fan of dawn tinsley the office and of dylan moran i thought that i would give it a go good decision this was without a doubt the funniest film i have seen this year and probably one of the funniest films i have ever seen it is hilarious from the first minute packed with jokes some obvious and groan worthy some quite subtle i think this is one of those films where each time i see it i will spot another gag i didnt notice last time around as well as being sidesplittingly hilarious it is actionpacked and there is a real sense of drama at some points so that makes it a comedyhorrorbuddy movie with drama action and violence all revolving around a lovestory has simon pegg missed a genre i dont think sothere is something for everyone in this movie and it is all done brilliantly dont go and watch this film with someone who embarrasses easily as they will move away from you in the cinema and pretend they dont know you just like my mate pete did when we went,black_comedy
this was one of the most fantastic films ive seen in ages dont often spend the money on the cinema but this was well worth it never laughed so hard and it was also scary and sad in all the proper parts in the right proportions scary enough that even my boyfriend jumped at one part another reason why british comedies are my favorite genreone of the nicest things was that you only have have to have seen one zombie movie ever to understand the parody making it appealing to a broader range of people and also it wasnt just a scene for scene mockery of any particular other movie as satires and parodies so often becomeloved it hurrah,black_comedy
i saw this as a prescreener or whatever they are called where the producer etc fill a cinema with the public to get their opinions before finalising the filmtaking into account for the unfinished sound work and the occasional blip in the picture i thought the film was excellentas soon as i am able i will be watching the final version to see if it has been changed muchhowever as a review i feel i must give the film a minimum of 810 even though the actors arnt world famous many of them have done various other things in the uk because of this none of them steal the show away from the storyline or the quality of the productionas a whole the film comes across as a spoof but the kind that asks nicely before it pokes the finger of fun at the originalfor those that are in the know there are many many references to horror movies of the past and even though i only spotted a few it enhanced the watching experiencethe film has a good pace good characters that are developed great direction great humour superb use of music and is well worth seeing as and when you can tho it is not necessary to see in the cinema,black_comedy
its a very good movie very clever script funny at times it isnt a scary movie at all but its an interesting mixture of comedy and action too bad im not british as i think i might have missed a joke or two here and there it seems from reading the trivia section that the main actor also did a fair amount of other british movies or tv series unfortunately i dont know any of the actorsactresses here but im happy that i gave it a try anywaynothing is really new the zombie theme is already in a lot of films and games the comedic styles are familiar making fun of other movies also isnt new but as a package this movie offers a pleasant surprise ive never smiled or laughed throughout almost a scary movie it makes a good saturday movie night,black_comedy
i happen to be a huge fan of old zombie flicks from the 70s and 80s the original dawn of the dead is a classic and couldnt wait for this to come out this movie is just a pure work of genius british filmaking ive noticed that in most american movies and soap operas the characters that are supposedly ugly and fat are still played by size 2 supermodels but this movie takes the cake for most realistic zombie flick which unfortunately says that other zombie movies are extremely fake character wise when watching this movie i actually believed that this could have actually happened and its good that they chose a more believable place for shaun to hang out and head to when the zombies began to come alive the humor was extremely funny i give this new age zombie flick two thumbs up,black_comedy
this romantic horrific suspense exciting funny comedy drama lonely friendly greatest or whatever you wish to say was the first of its kind zombie film i ever watched just look at the start of the movie some kind of lonely because shaunsimon pegg was busted with his exgirlfriend what is that a loneliest moment of being a human but later in the story they will just came back in their habit shaun best living for happiness place is the winchester a pub they didnt knew that the city was slowly infected by the virus some scenario here will make your lungs out of oxygen and your eyes was begging for water because of some nonstop laughs almost all of the time expect that something funny will happen shaun is a little bit of a dumb stupid person that instead of going a gun shop or police station theyd went in to the pub because of only one rifle my question is why would a dumb thought of that and doesnt think that one rifle beats hundreds of fresh flesh zombies just take a blanket in your bed and coat it to yourself before watching so the dead will not visit you laugh as you can,black_comedy
thoroughly enjoyed this film was totally gutted when it finished as its one of those films where you dont want it to end as it was so enjoyable it did a brilliant job of sending up the classic zombie movie and the subtlereferences to the original dawn of the dead and 28 days were appreciatedjust one small complaint  zombies go for brains if you havent seen this film yet love horror british humour and are in your late twenties and in a relationship thats going nowhere watch it you will not be disappointed,black_comedy
people can talk about this film and tell you why it is funny or not funny gory or not gory horror film or comedy etc here is the thing i went in not expecting much out of this film and had one hellava good time i really havent read other reviews so i do not know if anyone mentioned that this is actually a character driven comedy glued together with a zombie plot line i think if you are looking for a horror film then you may be in the wrong place the monsters in this film are being used as straight men to the main characters comedic antics it very much reminds me of an american werewolf in london in that it has the horror elements and great sfx used to tell a few other personal stories rather than truly attempt to frighten you not to say sotd does not have its share of gore i wouldnt let my 11 yo see it but it just is not scary gore but like i said in the beginning i had no expectations so i just took what ever was thrown at me absorbed it with a smilepick it up on dvd when it comes out,black_comedy
just have to say i saw this film when it came out in cinema and it was a cracker it was funny as hell this is just one that i will watch again and again and again you cant beat it my vote 10 out of 10 simon pegg and nick frost are the best actors i have seen in a long time and i hope they keep doing parts with each other and i hope they make shawn of the dead 2 if any one got told it was crap then dont listen it is one of the best i guarantee it  please contact me if you have seen this movie i like to here your comments on it as well thank you from crowman,black_comedy
zombies take over london while our hero reacts by walling himself and his closest friends in at the local watering hole telling fart jokes sorting his record collection trying to get back his estranged girlfriend and getting drunk along the way we getplenty o references to other zombie movies two tearful moments human characters immitating zombies irony in an averted  apocalypse finally zombies imitating humanslooking a little closer we can see humans fighting zombies in sync with a queen song humans flinging random household objects at zombies zombiethemed gameshowsso basically this is the best deliberately funny zombie movie since the return of the living dead and you should see it910,black_comedy
i saw a trailer for this film when i went to go see avp and at first it looked like and okay horrorcomedy two months later when i saw this film i just couldnt stop laughing everything is done great with this film the action the horror element and of course the comedy this film shows that the british should be the only ones to do comedies its that funny probably my favorite part is when shaun goes into the corner store to get a drink and doesnt even notice the blood stains on the wall or the dead clerk chasing after him at the end of the film well ill just leave it at rather unexpected and hilariousto sum it up is probably the funniest film since monty python and the holy grail and is the best film of 2004 by faroverall 1010,black_comedy
 worth a watch in fact i was crying with laughter at various points in the film at pegg and frosts hammy acting and witty one liners the throwing of hands in the air scene as the first zombie enters their house had me in stitches as did the discussion in the garden over which classic vinyl records they would throw at the zombiesi liked it has comedy traditional jumpy scenes when the zombies are after them and closing in as well as some very poignant moments such as when shauns mother becomes ill it is a lighthearted comedy horror not to be taken seriously lets face it the gory effects are very basic but it has a certain something that will probably appeal to most comedy horror fans its not cheesy like many hollywood comedy b flick horrors its pragmatic ironic sarcastic and poignant all rolled into one and the humour appeals to our very basic selfish selfpreservation instincts and wants as opposed to needspegg and frost compliment each other well like many comedy duos before them but the supporting cast also add to the intrinsic comedic value of the film,black_comedy
is an english sendup of the zombie genre which also evokes some of the climactic moments of such classics as george romeros night of the living dead the paradox is that while the movies saying the genres kaputt its also showing how viable it still is because its own main energy comes from standard zombie situations the world gone mad streets full of stumbling hungry ghouls people running out of places to hide your mum getting bitten and turned and having to shoot her so the genres like a zombie too it dies here but in dying comes back to fresh sinister life the initial joke is twofold shaun coauthor simon pegg and his slob roommate ed nick frost dont notice the zed invasion at first because theyre such lazy incompetent slackers but they also dont notice it simply because theyre true brits english sangfroid is another thing keeping them from seeing anything gone wrong in the streets of north london its just bad form to notice other peoples mess even when that mess entails corpses in the street and blood all over the door of the convenience store fridge when shauns stepfathers been bitten since hes the steely bill nighy the old boy keeps on making sense what more can shauns mum do but make a nice cup o tea this is a hymn both to slacker virtue and to muddling through the filmmakers draw enough humor out of shaun ed their less friendly roommate pete peter serafinowicz shauns disappointed girlfriend liz kate ashfield and lizs self righteous best friends dianne and david lucy davis dylan moran to create solid scenes throughout where zombies arent needed except as a buzzing gurgling chorus outside the walls forcing the group to keep together and be brave is also the story of an underdog hero physically shaun is like vince craig kelly in the original english queer as folk but without quite vinces level of charm like vince shauns shy deferential and not the most dashing guy around but inside theres a plucky reliable survivor just waiting to be let out for quite a while shaun and ed generate smiles with how despite constant radio and tv coverage they manage to disregard the zombie invasion in favor of electro music and video games theyve got to discover a girl ghoul in their own garden which happens after an all night drunk to forget lizs rejection of shaun before they finally get the picture their immediate reaction to the stumbling menacing staring creature is to think shes drunk too but then the deadfish eyes and bloody mouth are a tipoff this is the best moment  when the first really horrible thing happens but the pals are still arguing over which classic vinyl disk they can spare from their collection to bash out the zombies brains withonce shaun and ed have joined the fray and shaun turns into a hero leading his little band to that center of english and slacker life the local pub the film becomes in many ways a standard zombie flick except that its a bit brighter and more characterdriven the ending looks just as conventionally apocalyptic as any of romeros at first but theres a sequel six month later where shaun and liz have survived and live together ed and pete got turned and remaining zombies have been kept around to be used for industrial jobs and certain sports the unambitious day ending at the pub that defined shaun is now lizs idea of a good time too through his heroism in defending the fortress of the winchester he has restated and reaffirmed english values as his own without the last good laugh of the postscript that turns zombies into a joke again where it was in the opening sequences the movie would have succumbed to the genre its offing instead zombie movies have been put to rest for now this isnt a great film but its a cheery one and more coherent than danny boyles popular 28 days later which was all flash and no followthrough,black_comedy
i dont need to add anything to the comments that have already been made suffice it to say that everyone that i know who has seen sotd has loved it i am astonished however at how poorly this has done at the box office  particularly in the states its been uniformly well reviewed has had great public feedback and yet the great majority have avoided it like a plague of well zombiesi wonder if this will prove to be one of those slow burning cult films that gradually pick up business on video and dvd over the yearsi hope so it deserves a wider audience,black_comedy
british movies usually do not seem to entertain people so much though the critically acclaimer comedies like bend it like beckham and four weddings and a funeral  do seem to be credited with a certain kind of humor none have been as great as thisthis movie makes is so funny that it can officially be uks answer to dude wheres my car the stupidity in this movie would cause a laugh riot which is filled with enjoyment though the casting is almost completely unknown it does not outline the fact that the actors in this film are incapable of having great comedic potential and using that potential to make this one great comedy simon pegg who plays shaun and who also wrote this movie has undoubtedly given a breakthrough performance this would be an excellent recommendation for all people who liked dude wheres my car however if the british accent annoys you this movie would be unbearable,black_comedy
i havent been this impressed with the directing and script of a film for ages a few years back i read in a magazine article that attendance at the cinemas has decreased over the years because audiences are realizing that they can get the same caliber of entertainment particularly romantic comedies from tv puts movies back where they belongas a respite to the garbage on mainstream american television sotd is an oldnew kind of moviemakinga reminder of hollywoods yesteryear where outstanding script and original direction is as it should be the bread and butter of the film industryi havent laughed this hard at the movies or been moved emotionally for a long time this film has it all dont let the title fool youits more than just a funny campy film about zombies it will touch you in more ways than you can imagine,black_comedy
just watched sotd havent laughed so much for ages brilliantly funny the uk viewers will recognise the faces but doubt many outside the uk willbeing a particularly british sense of humour it probably wont travel well esp over the pond to the us still i recommend it to all and everyone simon pegg was the funniest ive seen him the supporting cast were also very good nick frost shows hes more than just silly bravo channel silliness dylan moran was so so pretty much playing the same dylan moran character he always plays im sure he could expand his repertoire if he wanted on a purely fun level a great way to while away 99 minutes nine out of ten,black_comedy
this is absolutely the funniest movie i have seen in a long long time great actors they dont need to say much their faces say it all great writers tooi will go and see it again because i am sure i missed a lot the first timewe need more movies like thisi cant wait for the dvd to be releasedwhen we were leaving the theater people in the audience were walking like they were zombies thats entertainment,black_comedy
one of the best films ive seen this year the humour and characters are completely british in what other zombie movie would the protagonist stop to have a cup of tea after discovering a zombie in their back garden or not notice that they have almost slipped over in a pool of blood when getting their morning cola it was amusing spotting all the current heroes of comedy in supporting roles eg matt lucas eds counterpart from little britain and rock profile reece sheersmith the goodlooking one from a league of gentlemen martin freeman and lucy davis who were the nations sweethearts in the officeexcellent  then again i would not expect anything less from simon peggbe warned though even though it is described as a zom com the death scenes are still pretty horrific,black_comedy
sotd has it allwell developed characters a tight script excellent pacing drama horror  superb humor it takes a special director to be able to balance all those elements and not come up with lint stew edgar wright pulls this off with precision wit and an uncanny eye for detail thats refreshing in todays millhouse film industry insert bay bruckheimer etc normally i like my horror with a little less humor but wright does it for lack of a better word right this film is very funny i mean itreally funny there are bright moments of black humor highlighted with gutbusting laughs and physical pranks throughout time and time again i found myself laughing aloud with the rest of the patrons at the local googleplex 18 there are also very touching moments as well this is rare indeedto sum upif you only see one zombie romance this yearmake sure its also be sure to stop by your local pub for a pint afters cheers,black_comedy
good to see so many positive comments on this movie which is testament to the quality of the writing direction and performances of the main contributorsi can see some flaws in the film but im baffled but the outright antagonistic comments of some posters obviously its diffrent strokes for diffrent folks but to attack the toilet humour seems to me to have missed a clever use of a mainstay of classic british comedy in sotd they have taken a fart joke and used it to help define the relationship between the two buddies and to lighten  the atmosphere in serious moments like when ed  oops best not say im no fan of the fart joke but this one isnt gratuitous its serving a purpose in the filmof course its possible the writers just find fart jokes funny in which case i take it all back,black_comedy
i am an avid lover of independent films and just about any film out of england or ireland so its no great shocker that i rushed to the theater to see on opening weekend opening at least locally i was prepared to be laugh cry say awwwwwwww and clutch fearfully at my husbands shirtsleeve i found the film to be terrifically funny on multiple levels with just enough romance to even things out im not big on the rocom scene the only thing lacking was actual fright there were a couple of jump scenes which got me probably as much because i expected to be afraid than because they were actually scary and there was a good dose of gore but not enough true suspense and horror for my taste in a horror movie anyway everything from the title forward captivated my sense of humor and i wasnt disappointedif you like indies if you like mixed genres if you like british films chances are youll love,black_comedy
is the funniest import from the brits in years simon pegg who cowrote the brilliant screenplay gives a star turn as a desperate everyman  a nice guy who seems destined always to finish last dumped by his girl taken advantage of by his best mate disrespected by his employees this is just for starters shaun is at first oblivious to the signs around him  that the dead have returned to life and these flesh eating bastards are hungry the prologue if you will where we see our first zombie shows shaun still oblivious offering his spare change this is only the beginning hilarity ensues once shaun springs into action with a plan to save and win back his girl liz save his mother and enlists the aid of his dimwitted mate ed of course the plan involves a retreat to the supposed safe haven of his favorite pub the winchester  named after the gun mounted above the bar where shaun has pretty much spent every drunken day of his adult life problems develop along the way when along with saving mum comes the miserable burden of having to save shauns detested stepfather this same problem occurs when in saving liz her roommates the ones who got her to break up with shaun to begin with also come along for the rideif this movie doesnt have you howling in laughter you may want to check your pulse    youre probably a zombieedgar wright strikes a nearly perfect balance between horror and humor and benefits from a cast that trust and wrap themselves around these charactersvery highly recommended,black_comedy
 than most of what we get in america comedy films here tend to be absurd and overthetop managed to mix humor satire and some extremely gory imagery into a wonderfully funny film in which the humor showed some wittwo guys on their knees trying to decide which phonograph records they should throw at the zombies oops sorry for using that word got my chuckles going for the rest of the film the little spurt of blood that popped from shauns head when he removed the dart was an excellent bit to borrow from monty pythonis a well written well acted movie true to its genre witty with its laughs and not without a few serious moments to ponder,black_comedy
this is a fantastic comedy that also happens to be a zombie film brilliantly worked in together by the writers simon pegg and edgar wright to give us a movie with more depth than the premise suggests it hinges around an excellent performance by pegg in the title role who makes the film believable whatever is happening on screen the build of humour throughout the film means that the astonishing emotional power of the ending may take you by surprise but go with it  because i promise you the film is worth it also cant leave without mentioning the supporting players all of whom fulfill their roles excellently special mentions to lucy davis and the always great dylan moran,black_comedy
2004 is the best zombie movie ever made and is leader of the zombie film resurgence of late in the most recent years we have had resident evil bad resident evil 2 worse dawn of the dead unresolved ending but good 28 days later mostly good biozombie good in a funnier and chinese night of the living dead way and now the cult jewel classic thank you guys that produced this film you have answered prayersfirst off this film begins as a comedy with some seriously kick butt montages where the camera zooms in and things happen in a quick succession shaun is a loser with no direction and loses his girlfriend he continues on moaning and drinking as usual while hell has literally broken loose and he continues to gloss over most stuff in life like work until he can resume playing video gamesthen he gets his act together to prove to his girlfriend that he will take control of his life then he and his mate ed a total slob leave his zombie infested house to retrieve his girl liz and her knuckle head friends and his mom this movie has it all in terms of style like i said earlier the quick zoom montage and some cool tracks including a scene when they beat a zombie while grooving to queen dont stop me nowthe movie has a undeniable sense of reality and hopelessness then the greatest finish in the history of zombie films much to the likes of the resident evil video game much better than the re movie the ending involves biohazard resident evil props militants blasting zombies rage infected monkeys mentioned in a blip on the tv 28 days later props and the naming of a zday in remembrance like dday in normandy finally a zombie movie where everything turns out to be okay in that universe whereas other films such as resident evil and the new dawn of the dead turn out lonely and undeadby the way the zombie makeup rocked and i appreciate that this movie did not have the action movie feel such as re and dotd do where the zombies are relentless during outrageous explosions 910,black_comedy
shaun and ed are two twentysomething slacker roommates shaun spends his days working playing video games and hanging out at the pub ed does pretty much the same thing except for the working part shauns world takes a turn for the worse when sensing that their life is going nowhere his girlfriend liz breaks up with him then things really get bad when zombies start showing up in his neighborhood and everywhere elsesoon after realizing that the dead are walking the earth nothing gets by these blokes shaun and ed decide to rescue shauns mother and father excuse me thats stepfather liz and her two roommates and find a safe place to hole up which turns out to be the pub of course in the course of this they have to fend off zombies with everything from cricket bats to record albums predictably things just go from bad to worse for the teamis a rare creature a film that effectively mixes humor and horror i havent seen a movie that does it this well since an american werewolf in london in the beginning there are lotsa laughs giving way more and more to the horror elements as the film nears its conclusion but even when things are at their most horrific this movie will surprise you with some hilarious bits there are even a few moments that tug on the heartstrings a bit something i hadnt expected at allmost of the performances are good and the directing camerawork and editing are all great the brilliant script is filled with sharpedged satire many of the humans in the beginning are very zombielike to begin with and jokes aplenty one of my favorite bits is when shaun and ed are fending off a couple of zombies with records from shauns collection choosing only the bad ones to fling at the undeaded purple rain shaun no ed stone roses shaun definitely not ed batman soundtrack shaun throw itif you have a strong stomach and a good sense of humor you should see this movie and soon,black_comedy
was one of the most creative and one of the funniest movies ive seen this year the laughs and action were almost nonstop the movie drags a bit when they take shelter in the pub but its a brief lagwith an original execution of a rather clich premise it was like a breath of fresh air as a spoof of zombie movies it succeeds its also the movie that scary movie could have been and should have beena couple of scenes are very memorable most notably the scene where shaun has to make an incredibly difficult choice concerning his mother this scene was easily as gripping as the adrenaline shot scene in pulp fiction also the last few shots before the credits made me laugh like i havent laughed in a whilemuch better than i expected id gladly see it again,black_comedy
its a farce in somewhat the same tradition as scary movie or naked gun though more subtle and reserved whereas scary movie and naked gun go completely overthetop with their parodies of horror and detective films hams up some of the zombie movie conventions without going overthetop there are several nods to specific films in the genre as well in one scene the two main characters are on the phone with barbara who they tell to sit tight while they come over to save her one of the characters yells into the phone were coming to get you barbara this is a reference to the first great zombie flick night of the living dead in which one character is teasing barbra while in a cemetery  theyre coming to get you barbra theyre coming to get you the first quarter of the film sets the baseline we see shaun waking up going to the corner market interacting with roommates and coworkers it essentially poses the question who are the zombies this question is partially answered as the transition to zombie nation is made just about everyone around shaun starts turning into a zombie and he doesnt even realize it hes so rapt in thoughts of his own interior world that the exterior world is merely a place in which he wanders rather than being an integral part of his daily interactions that is his own life is so monotonous and regimented and he is so thoroughly ensconced in his own world that everything outside of him goes unnoticed the question is answered fully during the films denouement which is mostly a series of clips from news programs that recap the zombie episode and its aftermath we also see that shauns best friend think brad pitt in true romance who was earlier turned to a zombie remains an avid video game player despite his zombie state in other words despite being a zombie little has changed of course all this is done in a funny way versus the cutting social commentary of the original dawn of the dead one thing that put me off a bit was the insertion of a couple heavy scenes in the film there were a couple death scenes which i couldnt reconcile within the context of the rest of the film usually farce films like this ham up the forced romance we see in these sorts of films but actually tried to play the romance and death story lines fairly straight there were laughs before and after these islands of seriousness but the laughs were generally outside of final goodbye or the we should be boyfriend and girlfriend again because i really love you scenes the filmmakers either fell prey to the convention felt they could get away with some touching moments or i didnt pick up on the humor in these scenes its not that im opposed to serious moments in a comedy but it felt misplaced in this film primarily because its a film of farce and parody of the zombie genre that minor quibble aside the film was consistently funny and made with enough panache to keep it interesting throughout oh the two lead actors did a really good job and their apartment walls were filled with great music posters funki porcini amon tobin saul williams company flow etc b,black_comedy
2004director edgar wrightstarring simon pegg nick frost kate ashfield dylan moran lucy davis penelope wilton bill nighyin a year where the zombie flick has all but been resuscitated what with the enjoyable remake of dawn of the dead and a sequel for resident evil although the less said about that the better its kind of funny that the best film of this kind to come out has been more funny than frightening former spaced cocollaborators simon pegg who also plays the title character and edgar wright treat us to their own homage to george a romeros living dead films ably assisted by a likable cast basically is what it says it is on the cover  a very amusing romantic comedy with zombies one that manages to be scary and quite touching despite its nonserious approach if it werent for the gore which we now have to accept as a necessity in zombie films id recommend this to anyone who hasnt seen it without a doubt suffice to say the target audience wont care and theyll love the soundtrack as well im sure but weve got to think of everyone here that said after having seen this i seriously believe that more british comedies should follow pegg and wrights approach note the dvd contains many worthwhile extras and apparently pegg and wright have landed cameo parts in george romeros next zombie film  land of the deadrating  out of ,black_comedy
is one of the greatest things ever to happen to the british film industry this zombie film is perfect it didnt have a massive budget but the way it all came out was fantastic the directing and the acting are both first class one of my only qualms about the film is the fact that bil nighy had too little to do as he was fantastic as shauns stepdad it is so good that even some of the extras produce great performances especially the asda employee turned zombie mary and the barman who was involved in the hilarious queen song sequence dont stop me now was the song which involved him being attacked by pool cues a fire hydrant before being driven headfirst into a jukebox definitely the film of the year,black_comedy
when i first saw i was surprisedshaun whos 29 and works at an electronics company breaks up with liz his girlfriend he realises what a mess his life is and so decides to sort it out however theres a problem the dead are coming back to life and eating the livingnot your typical zombie movie in fact at a stretch the movie could have worked without them just been a romantic comedy there isnt many people who could have pulled this one off but they have a fairly gory movie there are some points you do wish you werent eating that extralarge mega bucket of popcornnot the funniest or scariest of movies but the balance is just right slightly more of one would aim the movie at a more specific audience however this movie can be watched by a range of people and i would definitely recommend watching it,black_comedy
now i am not an expert of the horror genre but ive seen my share of zombie movies  oops  used the zed word this is not overly gory although there are a couple of scenes in particular that arent for the squeamish or those with weak stomachsthe humor is solid and the execution is well done we see shaun evolve from lost loser to a man with a focus although his girlfriend isnt all together there shes the blond shes supportive in the end and that is all anyone can ask fornow for his friend and flatmate ed  you just want to throttle that one lizs friends are stuckup at best but the scene where they all practice to walk and act like zombies is pricelessif youre going to see a z movie this is a good one to start with,black_comedy
this is a great movie i was very impressed by the whole atmosphere this movie created not everything was strictly comedy but it wasnt horror either the characters take more realistic action in this movie than in other horrorcomedy movies for example the actors arent terrified constantly and are willing to defend themselves against their foes was very funny and thrilling at the same time and it gives a great sense of realism in a totally fictional situation i am going to put this movie in the top 5 on my list for 2004 this year its well deserving of it i recommend it if you wanna go catch a fun flick or if you like zombie movies like christopher walken does,black_comedy
saw this movie last night this movie takes you from laughter to grossed out to sad to excited and then back to funny and then gorry and funny again i loved it what a ride nice to see some movie makers still have a sense of humour and can keep up grossed out at the same time the xbox playing doom buddy is just hilarious id keep him as a pet also just to keep me saneworth it loved it my girlfriend scared the crap out of a few patrons around us on several occasions with her loud screams scared me also a few time but dont tell her thatthanks for the great laughs great movie and good timeloved every minute of it,black_comedy
spoilers has romantic comedy a couple of touching scenes and some laughout loud dialogue provided by nick frost as sloppy roommate ed and this all happens while killingescaping zombies writerstar simon pegg has put together a good bit of familiar elements to make the most original film of 2004 pegg stars as title character shaun a late 20searly 30sish average joe whos happiest just grabbing a pint at the local pub or playing video games with roommate ed he has a beautiful girlfriend and a loving mother neither of which fit into that equation and its obvious that underachieving shaun needs an occasion to rise to so why not zombies pegg and director edgar wright begin the zombie scenario as a joke but soon the atmosphere turns tense as shaun  ed decide to lead their group of survivors to the pub to hole up and there the movie turns surprisingly very tense while still holding on to its wit the movie is more comedy than horror to be sure but youll be surprised at the chills it provides highly recommended,black_comedy
im from new zealand so i couldnt help noticing the similarities between and peter jacksons braindead and bad taste for that matter this really is a must see for fans of those films and other splatter comedy films eg the evil dead and reanimator seriesbut what sets this movie apart from earlier films in this genre is the performance of simon pegg as the eponymous shaun according to his profile on the bbc site httpwwwbbccoukcomedyprofilessimonpeggshtml he used to be a standup comedian and this really shows through in his performance the timing and delivery of his oneliners are impeccablethe rest of the cast are spot on tooand its not just funny and gory  there are some surprisingly touching momentsi gave it 810,black_comedy
this and the remake of dawn of the dead has revitilized the zombie genre in many ways i think has done this in the sense that it has helped the zombie movie attract more fans i am no big zombie movie fan and im also not a big fan of british even though im english movies of late but i certainly enjoyed this movie its funny simon pegg is good on television and has made a good step up playing shaun im almost sure hollywood agents are knocking on his door these daysfunnier than most films ive seen on first viewing though i must say i watched it again and wasnt near as good on the big screeni recommend it to all,black_comedy
was a breath of fresh air the air might have had a scent of rotting flesh but it was fresh i have found that independent films since the introduction of clerks have been superior to the main stream the reason for this is that they do not get caught up in big name media centered stars shaun is an enjoyable two hours with enough story alone to make it viewable ex the first halfhour or so you have a wonderful story about a man who has lost his grip on the corporate ladder had his love line cut and has a stepdad all while the city is dying around him that is what the tag line says and that is what you get  a romantic comedy with zombiesthis story continues even after the realization of the zombies ex now that shaun is starting to kill the undead or rekill thedead again anyway after he learns his new skill you can see his confidence rising by learning kungfu oh yeah at one point he is spinning his legs to stand up and using trampolines to jump over fences so overall along with the supporting cast and the lovable zombies is a great film aim for the head,black_comedy
i had a good time watching this movie was a great spoof of the zombie movies and in turn resulted in being a good zombie movie itself the first half of the movie concentrated on the comical side of the characters whether youre a fan of british humor or not i will find it hard to believe that a person will not laugh out loud at least once i enjoyed the gradual change from the comedy to action horror which ill confess was much less horror than it was more gory look out for a very gory and graphic scene i seldom look away from horror flicks but in this one i had no choice it was unexpected and disgusting but understandably a must if one is too truly spoof a zombie film,black_comedy
i felt i should wait for it to come out on video but went along with my teenaged son to see it too bad there werent more people in the audience its much more fun to laugh out loud when lots of other people are as well simon pegg shaunreminded me of dave foley newsradio all the other actors are perfectly cast many people might be concerned that since the movie is english that they might not be able to get the humor in fact this movie could very well have been set in any city in the us shauns everyday world is similar to any poor slobs who hasnt made much of his life in almost 30 years of living many lines lost to heavy english accents unfortunately if you dont get to the theatre definitely rent ityou will laugh you will cry you might retch a bit though,black_comedy
i loved it everyone in the theater was laughing from early on there were a few semisubtle jokes early on that everyone caught shaun slips in the convenience store while buying a soda and doesnt realize that it is blood but the audience caught it the most sensitive moments build and then they make you laugh the integrity of the main dude shaun is fabulous as they are escaping the first round of zombies they hit someone with the car shaun stops and makes sure that the victim is okay  or a zombie before proceeding the gore was just the right amount to add some drama im not that much a zombie expert i enjoyed return of the living dead and this was much more fun if you think it sounds like it might be funny then you will like it,black_comedy
i am a big fan of zombie flicks among my favorites are the romero trilogy the night remake from 1990 dead alive and versus now can easily be tossed up there with the best what troubles me is everyone calling it a satire or a spoof it isnt satire it deals with the zombies very seriously it is a zombie movie in the zombie movie sense it is fantastic it also has plenty of comedy heres where people say its really a comedy and not a horror movie who says horror cant have funny moments dead alive was a spoof shaun is a legit zombie movie with a lot of comedy a perfect mix of both genresearly on there is a lot of foreshadowing for the impending epidemic this was handled so well these guys are clearly fans of the classic in fact the visual fx artist worked on dead alive im glad to see someone sticks to the old school zombies the modern ones are not what zombies should be it makes them lose their charm and it seems romero is heading in the modern direction in hopes to start a new franchise that builds off of the originals i hope he reinvents and not destroys the genre that he made famousyou cant say doesnt have enough horror you cant say its really a comedy its really a zombie movie the zombie flick fall into its own genre shaun is a great zombie movie with a lot of fun and a great story if you see one zombie movie this year make it,black_comedy
so weve had the dead trilogy by george romeronight of the living dawn of the and day of the since then there havent been many big zombie movies save for the remakes of night and dawn a day remake is in the works but last year we got 28 days later a pretentious wannabe zombie movie that i still enjoyed but as a complete parody we havent really had any movies that is until came around its a noholdsbarred comedyhorror with some of the obvious social commentary that both dawns had but really its not even a spoof just a zomromcom as i believe the director wanted it to be called and its just what this world needsshaun simon pegg also the cowriter is the senior salesperson at an electronic store at age 29 he lives with his roommates slacker ed nick frost and uptight pete peter serafinowicz none are really going anywhere in life and shauns girlfriend liz kate ashfield just broke up with him then zombies start to walk the earth and shaun and ed have to go and knock them zombies back to hellin the first 15 minutes the movie gives off this bleak uninviting vibe the social satire is strong but the laughs and excitement are not then soon after the movie completely changes gears into this gory hilarious sendup of not just zombie movies but horror movies in general the body count is high blood runs through like an erupting volcano british accents are thick yet its a movie that you cant help liking the humor is variedfrom the dialogue from the images from the situations from the parodies from the effects from just about anything theres some great memorable sequences in there such as the hitting of the zombie with the pool cues and the absurdity of the whole movie makes shaun about equal to the dead series maybe it will become part of the official series but the whole cast has great chemistry many have been on the british tv show spaced and the characters are just normal people at times an office spaceish vibe was given off the character of shaun was a likable guy and everything and its the normal people we relate to in these tense situationsthe entire parody was great with a bunch of random jumps thrown in there for no reason whatsoever i hate to say this about a zomromcom but at times the atmosphere was pretty creepy i wouldnt go so far as to call it scary but for a comedy it was somewhat intense the movie was well shot with nothing unusual or any handheld camera movements or anything of the like straightforward directing by cowriter edgar wright makes the movie watchable also the acting was believable and at times overthetop see shauns reactions when he first sees the zombies but the nihilism of the shaun character worked especially when he walks through the town not realizing that everyone is a zombie theres some crazy stuff happening here and its some of funniest stuff youll see this year in theaters even if you dont like horror movies or bloodandguts movies id recommend it youll laugh no matter whatmy rating 810rated r for zombie violencegore and language,black_comedy
was well worth seeing it has lots of funny scenes and oneliners as well as some welltimed just plain silliness it also has some great gore but i wouldnt of minded seeing a little more of it there are some great references to other zombie movies which added even more funon the down side i found the pace to be a bit too frantic i was a little worn out by the end also being a yank the accents wore me out at times i kept thinking that i cant wait to watch it on dvd so i could turn on the captions just spoiled i guesswell worth seeing i give it 710,black_comedy
this movie is what you would expect zombie gore lots of violence and with a nice twist if it were a soda id call it lemoney of the wit of the britsthe movie spawned many inside jokes between me and my family my mother is british and there were times when we were the only ones laughing in the theater if you are not familiar with british humor cockney rhyming slang and anything else related to the brits i suggest you learn a little before seeing this movie it will definitely improve your experienceall in all along with some of the unnecessary gore im going to give it a 710 happy watching,black_comedy
man what a fantastic moviefirst off a zombie or horror movie that starts with a half an hour of character development needs due praise just for that what follows is one of the most insane zombie fests ive ever seen the film starts off like a kind of dark romantic comedy following the life of shaun and ed his slacker friend shaun breaks up with his girlfriend liz and begins to drink his sorrows away at the pub then the zombies enter in one particularly great scene shaun walks from his house to a convenience store and doesnt even notice that there are zombies all around him because england is like that all the timethe writing in the movie is impeccable definitely not what you would expect from typical zombie fare simon pegg gives a terrific performance as shaun and the entire supporting cast is great the film skirts on being hilarious and frightening but for the most part its just funny also the violence which is mostly impaling is pretty nongraphic which i think suits the film finehorror nuts will love the countless referrences to other movies were coming to get you barbara but pretty much everyone will enjoythe final cutdirection bthe direction of the film isnt perfect but it works just fine i found the constant cutting to be pretty obnoxious but you have to love the use of tracking shotswriting aprobably the best script ive seen all yearacting aalmost everyone is just finestyle acompletely original totally off the wallmusic bnothing really special but the scene with the lps classicoverall ayou will probably like this film tons,black_comedy
a truly weird mix of zombie film and comedy that works mainly thanks to its funny parts they are almost always excellent especially the really bizarre stuff whereas the more conventional slasher bits in the films final third isnt all that goodthe film looks gorgeous and the editing and music are brilliant the same goes for the acting theres also great pleasure to be had in seeing or hearing all the little things happening in the background throughout the filmoverall a wildly uneven film thats still well worth checking out 710,black_comedy
i was very impressed with it was very cleverly made focusing on the characters and their interpersonal relationships instead of the whole zombie situation was really quite unique to horror i really havent seen a movie that made me feel that it was worth my time in quite a while now understand that we dont get movies over here in the states with humor such as this on a regular basis hopefully american comedy writers will start taking a turn towards more clever humor im so tired of seeing comedy based on vulgarity and rampant stupidity this was a very welcomed change to all zombie movie goers and comedy lovers shaun is a must see,black_comedy
if this movie was 10 minutes shorter or the same length but a bit more focused it would have been one of the best zombie movies ever and definitely one of the best horrorcomedies of all time the comedy in the movie really brings the consequences of the zombie attack to the fore the choices these characters are faced with are really brought to fore through laughter shaun is a great main character and the supporting cast is great except the somewhat annoying male friend of his girlfriend his coworker at the store is good in both of his roles overall this was a very enjoyable movie with one very good drunk sequence likes of which we will not see in a long while  710 and could have been more,black_comedy
i wouldnt normally go to a zombie flick even with a free offer of the now insanely high priced popcorn scooped out in manhattan theaters but director edgar wright also cowriter turned out a roaringly funny spoof of zombie films also caricaturing many other genres and its all based on a true storyset in a working class london neighborhood this film would have fallen as flat as a flatfooted guys arches if made in the us the focus is on a small group of friends having the relationship problems that infest most sitcoms shaun simon pegg who also is cowriter is an appliance salesman sharing a flat that earns the most slovenly set oscar with two guys one is sick and tired of the third guys belching gas blasting beer guzzling video game obsessed mindlessness that fellow is ed nick frost the roommate from if not hell at least the end of the bar in a pub that doesnt care much who sidles up for a drink but shaun is his everloyal defender his trueblue mateshaun is how original the idea a forgetful suitor of liz a very peppery pretty and fun character kate ashfield he cant even make a dinner reservation for a much anticipated by liz romantic evening shaun does have a nice relationship with his mom but a less than ideal one with his stepfather philip bill nighy who was terrific in love actually and turns in a very good performance hereearly on there seem to be a number of folks walking about the street who arent feeling well public service announcements on the telly report a spreading flu very soon shaun and his set are besieged by hordes of extras all beautifully made up to be homicidally weird but hardly frightening zombies they add to their ranks by biting the dwindling number of healthy folks shaun and liz accompanied by ed and another couple frantically seek to stay alive through a series of misadventures that build up to a very funny denouementwhile obviously lampooning zombie flicks is the main theme this director and cast set their sights on other very familiar screen staples including1 guy must mature to keep gal who dumps him but really hes the only fellow in the world for her of course2 monty pythonesque extreme silly violence with ample blood flow and many bitten and wrenched body parts special effects here are quite good3 adversity brings out the hero in if not everyman then at least our hero shaun4 heroic im a goner but you gotta get out of here now scene5 the ever imperturbable english newscaster who reports horrific depredations by monsters with the same aplomb customarily employed to announce yet another aristocratic sex scandal6 ingenuity in devising weaponsand theres much moreno one will be affrighted by although those who found quick dismemberment in monty python offputting probably wont like the heavy dose herecant imagine what the special features will be on the dvd910,black_comedy
what a filmthis is one of the best zombie films everforget the serious dawn of dead zombies are the joke of horror moviesthey are slow stupid very easy to kill and they also smell badthey dont run and they dont open doorswhy do other films mess with what a zombie really is they are there to stabshoot and make fun of and does it so well its funny the girl in the back gardenbrilliantly acted and it has plenty of blood and gutsjust what zombie fans whant to see this film should have been no 1 go and see iti bet this film does a donny darko and becomes popular when it comes out on dvd in the statesbritish film making at its best,black_comedy
i was afraid my expectations would be too high after reading all of the favorable comments on this board and after seeing the favorable reviews on tvthis movie deserves all of the kudos it has received and then somesimply one of the best movies this year very well made good characters good storyi definitely want to see this one again and againif you are reading this message board because you are interested in whether or not you should see this film wait no longer go see this film it is well worth the time,black_comedy
i was hopeful when i saw previews of but was a bit suspicious now that ive seen it im happy to say that my concerns were unfounded no doubt this was one of the best movies ive seen this year in fact this was one of the best zombie movies ive ever seen it matches both dawn of the dead in atmosphere and return of the living dead in humor and yes i know return of the living dead isnt part of the original trilogy its still my favorite film of all time though well its now competing with those of you that have not seen or are not fans of the original living dead trilogy will be missing quite a bit so i understand if you dont share this view but for those of you that have seen and loved the original trilogy this movie is for youi consider myself a bit of a connoisseur of horror films and zombie films in particular and this movie did not disappoint the humor which was distinctly british not a bad thing kept the audience rolling in the ailes wonderfully the humor was thoughtful creative and wellplaced i laughed until i cried but never felt as though id been made a fool ofadmittedly there were a few slow parts in the film and there are some decidedly thoughtful parts of the film that detract from the overall mirth but the film as a whole is amazingthe homages to that which came before and the new twists presented made this movie a perfect blend of comedy horror satire and social commentary those of you that are fans of sonys playstaion 2s hit resident evil outbreak should particularly enjoy the bar scenes personally i cant wait for the dvd release as im sure i didnt catch half of the trilogy gags that were there ill be watching and loving this movie many times again,black_comedy
i saw this movie simply out of curiosity and the fact that the few previews i saw of it made it out to be a great film and it didnt prove me wrong was probably one of the best films i have seen in a long time i was laughing all the way through the film and found the references to previous zombie films very humorous besides the jokes which were some of the bestmost creative ones ive seen in a long time the romance was a nice and very different touch to such a film this was the only aspect about the movie that prior to viewing it couldnt understand how it tied into the movie without sticking out like a sore thumb but i must say it blended in wonderfullythe horrorgore was kept at a nice level were it wasnt totally gross out thats sick blood and guts but rather to the point where it got your attention and went a tad bit further great however in the balancing of humor and gore so not to get one too into the film but still at the same time laughing the whole thing offthere was nothing wrong with the movie apart from being one of the most creative and hilarious films ive seen in a very long time i would love a sequelafternoon tea anyone,black_comedy
with the recent uprise of awful sitcoms here in the uk its nice to see that good british comedy isnt truly dead arf even better to see a good british comedy film that responds so well to our friends across the atlantic and one that credits neither richard curtis or hugh granthaving never watched the apparently excellent series spaced and not being a massive fan of zombie movies i wasnt really sure how i was going to respond to thisthankfully i loved it it may be a zombie film but its the hilarious dialogue and brilliant chemistry between the characters that warms the core of this movie crucially the film maintains a suitable balance between drama and comedy at the right moments and fortunately unlike a lot of films in this genre never plunges to ridiculousnessthe wayans brothers couldve learned a thing or two from this had it come before the awful scary movie series ill be checking out spaced very soon 810,black_comedy
i enjoyed this movie i dont tend to like any movie relating to zombies but the humor and total irreverance just sold me on this movie plus there is a message in the middle of all this about turning that curve into adulthood by the way you live your life instead of merely because your age says you are an adult many can identify with shaun who is still stuck in the college mode and havent quite turned that corner despite being a perfectly likable good person this also is more than just your zombie flick because of the british humor as an american it was a real treat to see this movie splashed with british eccentricities im totally sold on a movie that is so clever that it diverts my attention from the gore thats a truly successful movie in my opinion8510,black_comedy
i loved this movie it was funny and scary at the same time at times i would laugh so hard id almost pee in my pants or i would spilled my popcorn because i keep jumping out of my sit in fright i cant understand why it didnt make that much money its first weekend out people are crazy if they dont go to see this movie this would make the perfect date movie one of those movies that you can see with your best friend or girlfriend i give this movie two thumbs up if you miss this movie you miss out on one of the best movies this year great movie so go see this movie and you will laugh your butt off and jump out of your seat enjoy the movie,black_comedy
i must admit im a big fan of british comedy its a nice feeling and gives you a chance to see whats out there other than american comedy both have their strengthsand their weaknesses shaun will usually make you have this constant smile on your face as the jokes just keep coming you get the sense that the creators of this zombiefest wanted to get this right want to laugh want to have some dramatic scenes that help build character development so you actually care for actors trust me you need this in a good movie do you want to be scared and do you want to laugh my oh my does this deliver for an added bonus for you hippies out there see it high or sneak in a beer youre going to love the next 15 hours of your life references to the latest british zombie flick 28 days later make this a beauty,black_comedy
a quick word i really liked this movie was surprised it was as bloody and frightening as it was wasnt expecting it to actually be a decent horror film but thats certainly okwhat id really like to point out however and understand this isnt a slam is that the zombies were not essential to the movie they were mere plot devices i imagine most people are thinking not essential its a zombie movie of course its essential my point is when you break it down its not a zombie movie to steal their tagline its a romantic comedy with zombies the movie is about shaun and lizs romance the zombies are only there as a plot device a catalystthat all taken care of the movie really is great i rank it up there with my all time favorites the evil dead trilogy if you like horror comedies zombie films or romantic comedies and have a stong stomach see this filmnow,black_comedy
well known to british television audiences for the surreal comedy spaced cowriter simon pegg heads a top notch comedy cast for a film which manages to be both one of the funniest big screen comedies in years and a gory horror film which will satisfy any disciple of the splatter genre indeed this is probably the most satisfying amalgam of the two forms since the early films of sam raimi and peter jackson the former gets several nods in the script as  of course  does george romero british comedy fans will also spot a veritable whos who from recent hits in the supporting cast spaced the office black books little britain if this movie leaves you cold you might as well leave the pub and join the zombies,black_comedy
i spotted shaun in the upcoming releases of imdb and dismissed it for several weeks because of its lackluster ok i get it title only after curiosity compelled me to click on some film critic reviews was i wowed by the response any zombie flick that results in so much positive feedback has to be worth a lookand after looking the good news is that in spite of an almost slow beginning and a laughless 15 minutes toward the end but not the end which in retrospect could not and should not end any other wayit is fuuunny and fitting this has more belly laughs than any movie ive seen in years its sharp clever and still manages to respectfully retain the horror element if not so much the scary element at no time during the movie did i slap my knees while cursing under my breath for the on screen characters to run faster or get out of there quicker instead i was reduced to a glob of jello with laughter because the characters werent running faster or getting out of there quicker especially in the slow buildup scene that displays the dangers of child resistance car locks not without flaws there seemed to be too many times when flocks of zombies just stood there waiting for what before the director gave the goahead to jump start their lunge toward their victims but for comedys sake sometimes you dont mindromeros original dead trilogy is the thrilling fun and the cremedelacreme in zombie horror why oh why did it take so long for another zombie movie thats mostly a comedy to finally get it right with characters that are right for this genreand shaun and ed make a wonderful comedy team with great on screen chemistry that alone was worth the price of admissionnow the faster dies a quick death in america no pun intended the faster it can rise from the undead and into the realm of dvd sorry if it sounds selfishbut what the hell ive already made room for it in my dvd library so lets release it already after all the brits got it and theres still too many great movies made in queenland that dont receive their due recognition in the states so what else is newas tempting as it is no way no way am i spoiling anything of what happens too many reviews already gave away some very choice moments for some reason even knowing some of them did not ruin the belly laughs i laughed just as hard anyway,black_comedy
this movie is very witty and clever and even though it hits its satirical topics over and over a bit too much  it still is flat out funny and has some wonderful touches the opening satire of many people going through life like a zombie is well done but then the director keeps going back to the well once too often  but the relationships are well drawn and shaun is a perfect member of the lost late twenties generation nick frost gives an excellent performance as his slacker best friend and its great to see tim bevan  one of the stars of the hit bbc sitcom the office put his tv money to good use bevan is one of the exceutive producers of the film and even makes a brief cameo overall a little bit of gore some chills but overall just damn funny,black_comedy
the concept seems like a horrible hollywood pitch living dead thriller meets goofy romantic comedy however britains deadpan answer to the resurgence of zombie movies like 28 days later and the new dawn of the dead is just that and remarkably its funny as hell pun fully intendedsimon pegg who cowrote plays the titular shaun a protagonist content with the rut hes created for himself this routine of video games and beer is no longer enough for his girlfriend liz who tries to coax more out of the slacker but shauns relationship with liz isnt the only one changing as shauns two dynamically opposed roommates play tugofwar with him as well the real trick behind this movie is the surprising depth of its characters as well as wrights eye for comedy despite early warning signs theres nary a zombie to be seen for the first thirty minutes of the film but chances are youll be too busy laughing at the barrage of gags to notice about halfway through shifts into typical blooddrenched zombie mode with the band of lead characters crossing london to try and find a safer place to hide tensions flare up between the group as the zombies slowly penetrate their safe haven but the comedy rarely wavers with the exception of a few touching scenes that because theyre genuine are more memorable than any of the gruesome violence ultimately the film knows how to give fans of both genres exactly what they want to see without being tempted by the clichs that would easily ruin such a precarious tightrope act could be im just a sucker for british comedy and zombie flicks or it could be that this is the smartest movie in theaters right now,black_comedy
is a british import and apparently was a big hit overseas its tag line is a romantic comedy with zombies and i think that about sums the movie up its not necessarily a spoof on zombie movies like i had expected but a homage to george romero and horror movies in general in a recent fangoria article the director even admitted that the movie should take place in the same universe as the romero trilogy of zombie flicks  and that this was a representation of what was happening in great britain at the same time there is plenty of humor but at the core its a love story i think its a great date movie actually if you and your loved one dig horror i cant say its my favorite zombie movie dawn of the dead wins that honor but its one of my favorite comedies this year its just a good time at the movies and if you hate hardcore horror this is a good alternative,black_comedy
this film was an incredibly pleasant surprise having seen other zombie movies which wont be mentioned here was simply fantasticthough the genuinely english wit may not appeal to everyone the theatre was bubbling with laughter during the film the comedic timing is impeccable and its full of small gags that keep you on your toes all the way through the character themselves are a ridiculous bunch have they each have their own certain charm and are incredibly lovable in little waysi would highly recommend this film to any one looking for a great laugh its hilarity with a smattering of madcap violence and sprinkled with zombies it was well worth the ticket price and more,black_comedy
well i can honestly say this is the first movie i have ever ever actually gone back to the theater to watch a second time and if i had more money i would go back right now its got a perfect blend of practically every good quality you could want in a movie and the actors pull off their bits perfectly the cut scenes and timing are excellent there are so many things that you just cant see in one viewing that you pick up on laterdefinitely going to get this movie on dvd as soon as its outtheres too many scenes to mention but near the very end the line in the television show he cant quite get there can he is just freaking awesome hehe hats off to the cast and crew for making a truly clever and horrendously entertaining film,black_comedy
my god if theyre ever was a movie that made me laugh so hard it would be i went to go see it on friday september 24th 2004 and thought this is going to be a funny movie and i was righti saw the trailer for it while watching alien vs predator with my boyfriend and might i say seeing the trailer was the best part of the entire movie and i was not sure if i should laugh or raise my eyebrow in confusion but i knew it was going to be goodwhen the movie started it was shaun and his mates living their lives simple right but somehow with no explanation people began turning in to zombies and eating people except for shaun and his friends which was weird but its british right the movie was a perfect combination of happiness sadness comedy and angst that i would recommend this to all people who can understand what in the world they are saying and want to laugh until they die,black_comedy
what a howler i saw this in a cinema in los angeles last nite and it had them rolling in the aisles the line that ed says when he pulls up in the jag had em screaming with laughter there was even a spontaneous round of appaulse at the end something rare in la congrats to the team for a truly brilliant comedy that really lifts our spirits this film gets my vote for best picture so far this year i cant remember the last time i cried with laughter,black_comedy
ok  first off american here though i love british humorhas to be the most inconsistent move ive ever seen its low points were so low and so bad that i actually mulled getting up and walking out of the theater something ive never done or even felt during a movie before its high points however were so funny that they rank among the top ten of the funniest sceneslines ive ever seen in a moviehuhwithout giving anything away i can say that starts slowly painfully slowly as if nobody would notice if they didnt really have an intro the filler scenes which depict the theme of the movie were way too forced as if the director and writer were making the movie for cretins and then  the zombies start coming out and there are some of the best scenes ive ever seen in terms of humor not horror in a moviethen it died and died horribly the movie throughout its length is part real zombie film part spoof part comedy part britishsituationaloccupationalcomedy and the problem is that the parts not only didnt mesh but as single units they were awful there were attempted jokes most of them incredibly poor and attempted british situational humor the type of which nobody outside britain would find funny and i love british humorand then it resurrected itself the ending was brilliant again some of the funniest scenes ive ever seen in a film just stunningis two movies one with a rating of 5 and one with a rating of 10 violently fused together it should not be missed nor should it be watched as a whole,black_comedy
one reviewer left a rather long negative review and i quote a bit here that seemed to summarize the main compliant im seeing against this movieits not a comedy a romantic comedy a spoof or homage it simply doesnt know what it isummmm why exactly is this movies inability to be shoved into one tiny little category a bad thing i loved the movie because it was not a standard comedy or a standard horror film or standard anything it has the absurd the painfully mundane the scary the sad the touching and all that all in one and that is the only reason this movie works i think it knew what it was it was entertainment with some social commentary thrown in without taking itself too seriously ever no more no less its a good movie but if you want dumb and dumber or 28 days later or harold and kumar this isnt it its not a laughaminute movie nor judging by the audience with me that scary a movie but thats good i think its worth the time to see it though im not sure id say its worth the price of a movie theater admission at anything other than the afternoon prices not that its bad just i dont think seeing it on the big screen is going to add that much more than seeing it on the tvbut it is good and i think most people will enjoy it,black_comedy

tagline for the film is a romantic comedy with zombies that seems to pretty much spell out this film its the best film ive seen in theaters all year the movie is a riot apart from bad santa its the funniest movie ive ever seen and i wouldnt even call it a comedy i dont know what to call it the movie is also the bloodiest most goriest zombie flick ive seen since day of the dead which is my favorite zombie flick well next to of course there is one particular scene when a character is literally torn to pieces and my mouth was literally wide open i was in disbelief at what i was seeing myself and a friend caught an advanced screening of and we both loved it this is best movie ive all year a pleasant surprise that it didnt suck it at first appears to a spoof but it is definitely not it works as a zombie movie a comedy and a romantic comedy to me its basically love actually meets dawn of the dead meets dumb and dumber its a perfect blend of horror and comedy a good portion of scenes made me jump some horror movies dont manage to do thati am a huge fan of zombie movies this one takes the cake i loved the remake of dawn of the dead awesome suspense even some scary parts but this just rules over any other zombie movie the original night of the living dead dawn of the dead zombi day of the dead they are all classics and i know that will soon become as popularly and as respected as thosei feel lucky that my teacher yes a teacher gave me two tickets to an advance screening to see this movie because it doesnt looks like its going to be put into very many theaters and i dont think itll do too well at the box office being a huge movie fanatic this was a rare treat to see an advance screening this was my first and even better the movie rules this is now of the all time favorite moviesi thought that zombie movies were dead boy was i wrong dawn of the dead resident evil 28 days later which i did not enjoy and now these movies are just as alive as they were back in the days of the night of the living dead and dawn of the dead i cant wait till the next zombie movie arrives hopefully a remake of day of the dead is in order or another george romero gorefesteither way it just goes to show that zombie flicks are anything but dead ive never met a zombie i didnt like by that i mean zombie movies seem to always rule return of the living dead was quite entertaining not too bloody though the remake of night of the living dead was another excellent zombie flick however the return of the living dead sequels arent as good as the original or any other zombie movie for that matteri certainly didnt expect this to suck it just was a whole lot better than i could have imagined it was incredibly gory bloody so much swearing when english people swear its funny hilarious zombie movie with a lot of heart and soul you dont need to be a fan of zombie flicks to enjoy this movie,black_comedy
spoilers ahead  all too often these socalled humorous horror movies tend to be more ridiculous than anything else but is a brilliant piece of moviemaking while the horror elements are really strong although the movie is really not all that scary i will remember that one disemboweling scene for a long time the humor is what makes the movie like in the original dawn of the dead the social commentary is so right on the nose you cant help but laugh shaun and ed spend a day or so completely oblivious to the horror that is going on outside and i was laughing because i know people just like that people who wouldnt know there were riots in the streets because they would be too busy playing playstation or something something else i enjoyed were the subtle references to night of the living dead and dawn of the dead like some of the chords in the opening sequence that were reminiscent of dawn and when ed said into the phone were coming to get you barbara a superb movie it will find a place in my heart right next to another humorous horror movie  tremors,black_comedy
my review of the movie itself is pretty short for the sole reason that every time i start to talk about this movie to anyone i cant help but want to reference scenes that arent quite spoilers but i know i would rather have be a complete surprise to me this is one of those movies that i was glad i knew very little about other than the trailer looking hilarious before i went insimply put this movie was great the closest parallel i can think of is evil dead 2 or army of darkness not from any similarities in plotstructureetc but simply for the fact that the movie is both a strong comedy and a strong horror i was very surprised that it was able to pull off both so effectively on the comedy angle the trailer almost doesnt do justice to the film sure there are a few things youve seen but this movie hits you with joke after joke after joke i am positive that the second time around i am going to pick up on a lot of things that i completely missed the first time there are subtle jokes all over the film after you see it check out the imdb trivia and look at everything you missed i was amazedon the horror angle i was very surprised while the movie is definitely a comedy were i to have to pick only one genre it has all the chaos and gore of an evil dead 28 days later dawn of the dead etc in fact there are a few scenes fairly late in the movie that are downright disturbing this for me at least was largely because they blindsided me i was laughing along with the movie and trying to not miss jokes while laughing when suddenly the zombies do something unspeakable to one of the characters and your laugh turns to ha haaaaohhhh damn yet the movie will follow one of those scenes with something hilarious literally seconds later often playing upon the very fact that the horrific action happened there is fungore disturbinggore one particular scene all ill say is winchester guy with glasses window damn slapstick silliness very dry humor situational humor of which the characters are often completely unaware raunchy jokes and even a few scenes that make you dare i say it sadthis is what makes this movie so great it is a rollercoaster ride that never takes you too far in any one direction if you are a fan of much of any british comedy and like horror movies dont miss thisrating 9510a word though about this idiotic argument that is going on on imdb about will us people get the jokes this is quite possibly the dumbest argument i have been witness to in the past 10 years not to mention the level of insults stereotyping and inflamed jingoism about things that have nothing to do with this movie is simply baffling to mefirst of all its a freaking movie are people really so angry in life that you cant just turn off the outside world for a while and go watch a movie and maybe just maybe remember that were all pretty much the same people despite our political differencesthe argument itself is ridiculous given that it relies on stereotyping to support it british humor american humor rubbish bollocks my apologies to my uk friends if i spelled that wrong hehe ive watched comedies of all sorts my whole life including a ton of british comedies are you being served yes minister fawlty towers red dwarf monty python duh black adder mr bean etc etc etc the idea that there is a general line you can draw through british comedy is ridiculous theres the range of drywit to fallingdown slapstick just like everyone elseanyway im rambling but seriously people get over yourselves and learn to laugh more,black_comedy
ill try to keep this spoiler free but there might be some minor ones aheadas a zombie nut and a casual fan of english humor ive been waiting shaun to hit the us since before its uk release back in april i hadnt watched a movie in theaters since 1999 but i held out and did not view the internet captures or the bootlegs that were out over the summer i wanted to see this one in the theaters and had high hopeson thursday i caught an advanced screening and delivered as a zombie fan i dug the nods to other zombie movies that popped up throughout the movie and the use of the goblin soundtrack from dawn of the dead the scene where shaun and ed finally notice that the dead are walking is hilarious and the reactions to the zombies were well done in a human and dead pan manner ill just say that i agree with a lot of people who have said that this is right up there with romeros trilogy and is the best zombie movie i have seen since at least the 1990 remake of night of the living deadthe rest of the audience enjoyed the movie and laughed in many of the same spots i did so it wasnt just meill probably see this one again before it hits dvd in the states and i recommend anyone else to give a view,black_comedy
i havent laughed this hard at a movie in ages thank god the brits can give us yanks movies to laugh at  since were always laughing at their dental careor lack there of anywho its great people if you see one zombie movie this year see this shaun laughs he cries he gots ped he passes out and he kills zombies with a cricket paddle gots to get me one of them  shaun is a man with a mission he hangs about the local pub with his buddy of vibrant tongue and is stuck with a nowhere job and a girlfriend thats grown tired of him  until north london changes on him really changes so thanks for giving us a language uk and thanks for,black_comedy
i went into this movie with insanely high expectations and every time that happens the movie has sucked hardcore but this movie was an exception this is one of the goriest fright films ever made to steal the quote from the dead alive dvd box but i think this one takes the cakethe movie has just enough plot for you to not be sitting there going  what the hell is happening and plenty gore to keep all those slasher film purists at bay shaun is one of the most dynamic characters in comedic history he actually has more than one dimension and he is a great farce of a characterhonestly i think that the new idea of fusing horror flicks and comedies is genius and this is the best example ive ever seen of this genre better than all the craptacular chucky movies i think that simon pegg is probably one of the greatest farce writers ive wiitnessed maybe even surpassing niel simon overall 9510,black_comedy
i missed at the cinema waited to see it but just couldnt find the time same as the new version of dawn of the dead too many engagements to get there i remember going to see george a romeros version at my local cinema about 8 times before it was taken off i thought it was the best movie i had ever seen and just loved the blood and guts of it we used to walk through our local shopping centre afterwards and imagine all those shoppers turning into zombies and how we would barricade ourselves in the local marks and spencers until the trouble was over at least we would not starve on the good grub in the food hallso would have been right up my street i really enjoyed 28 days later and the resurgence of the good old zombie movie was like a breath of fresh airso what do i think of i think it is absolutely superb a great british zombie movie to live with the best fun exciting and it still makes you jump in placesi am not going into the plot as this has been expressed by others on numerous occasions just sit back and enjoy itsome have said that americans wont get the humour i disagree a twat is a twat in any languagepegg and frost are superb as the main characters ably supported by some very good british actors including bill nighy who should have had more screen timeand the sweet lucy davis from the office baby carroti have grown up watching the same movies as pegg and wright in fact i live in the same town as where wright comes from could have bumped into him down at poole quayif i see him or pegg down there i will buy them a pint for entertaining me for a couple of hoursgo see it excellent entertainment come on guys lets have part two1010,black_comedy
dont let the trailer fool you this is not a comedy horror its a horror comedy in other words its a horror film that makes you laugh rather than the other way round in fact there are some moments where you actually feel uneasy spoiler theres the part where shauns best mate buys it and shauns left in the cellar with seemingly no way out you find yourself wondering where the and then i woke up part kicks in as surely no comedy film would have a main character killed offthere are parts that are genuinely quite creepy but more importantly theres a lot of subtle comedy that you just wouldnt associate with a zombiecomedy watching the opening sections were shaun goes to work the shops and then watching the same route but zombiefied you notice a subtle change to the background eventsall in all its a helluva lot better than youd think 810,black_comedy
to me the thing that set this movie apart from most is that i was laughing the whole way through as a movie from the uk the witty humor was a refreshing change from the norm ie sex jokes and was able to get the same reaction while being much cleanerthe movie is about shaun normal guy in his late twenties hes not really respected doesnt really ever do anything just sits on his sofa most of the time and does nothing but when people start turning into zombies shaun realizes that he has to do something and save the people he cares aboutas i mentioned was absolutely hilarious and is worth seeing if you like other british comedies ie monty python guy richie fawlty towers then this movie is definitely for you,black_comedy
it is a very hard line to cross in todays cinema to make a film that part comedy and horror film normally when this happens we end up with something like the chucky series it began serious but after seeing the new preview i know they have given up serious horror and invaded into the world of campy horror i was afraid at first that this film was going to go into that direction but then i remembered  this film wasnt made in america it was made in britain where the humor is actually intellectually funny as i was sitting and enjoying this film from beginning to end i couldnt help but wonder why america has not been able to master this style of film yet why is our comedies still heavily based in the sex humor or bathroom jokes while there were some in this film i felt the majority of the humor was logic and intelligence based if you listen to the words you will laugh at the jokes style of comedy instead of waiting to see who will fall over what firstwith its firm grasp on the comedy aspect delivers an exceptional grade for its creativity it takes a lot of brain work to be able to think of a story about zombies where our main characters are oblivious to the fact that anything horrible is happening in the world until the second act that was actually some of my favorite parts of this film i was there sitting in the theater knowing that it was a zombie film still can i call it that and nearly missing the entire zombie clues going on in the background my eyes were focused directly on our star and scenestealer duo shaun and ed one of my favorite scenes of this film is when shaun is going to work after the dead have risen and goes through the motions as if nothing strange is happening while there is chaos and destruction all around how many of us have gone to work and not even noticed anythingdifferent happening in our daily routine sometimes we get so caught up in the motion that we miss any different actions i couldnt stop laughingwhat also made this film work on every level was the cast director edgar wright has done a fantastic job of placing the right actors with the right characters they were each believable in their own part and i loved every scene with bill nighy he was perfectly cased and you could just tell that he loved being in this film that is another great aspect of this film it was a fun film and you could tell that the cast was having fun with their roles and were comfortable in their environment so many times we watch these style of films and we see miscasting and uncontrolled actors doing anything to ensure that they stay at the top of peoples minds this wasnt happening in this film i wasnt familiar with many of the actors so i couldnt play favorites all i could do was sit back and enjoy everyone and everythingi would like to end with the comment that this is still a zombie film it is a love story surrounding a zombie film where the director has chosen to emphasize the love story instead of blowing everything up i know that sounds strange but you will get used to it american viewers i mention that it is still a zombie film because i do not want people going thinking that this is a spoof while it does pay homage to several of the classic horror films this film stands on its own two feet it had blood it has violence and it has those infamous scenes of peoples heads being blown apart that is why we see zombie films overall if you love zombie films and you are a fan of the office or any hugh grant film than will appeal to you i dont remember the last time i witnessed such a creative filmgrade  out of ,black_comedy
there wasnt much of a crowd in the theater when i saw this but both me and my girlfriend loved this i dont think that the rest of the audience understood most of the humor this movie works very well for people who are familiar with the subgenre of living dead movies the story starts a little slowly and even after its clear to the main characters that theyre dealing with a large problem the movie doesnt jump into action even if you are familiar with all of the appropriate movies the accents might put you off if you have a history of disliking accents then this isnt for you although ive only seen this once i know that ill buy this once a region 1 disk becomes available no living dead collection is complete without this,black_comedy
its almost alarming just how well this movie works genuinely funny sincere and clever this is a movie with enough for just about everyone the filmmakers make its balance of comedy gore romance and fully realized characters seem effortless but this movie succeeds in ways that romero rodriguez craven raimi jackson and carpenter have all failed this movie has very few weaknesses if any the only one that really springs to mind is that due to the mixing of genres the pacing seems a little off at first but this was not even a concern upon repeat viewingi can imagine very few people not enjoying this film can a hit movie still become a cult classic whatever this movies fate its sure to endear itself to whoever happens upon it,black_comedy
i had been waiting for this one for a while i heard a lot about this movie on various horror movie forums i participate inthis movie was great i thought that the classic zombies the non running type humor and cheese made a good campy comedyhorror flick the cast was well put together i could tell they had some fun with this one and the comic timing made for some good hard laughs from the audience overall i would say this one was a good date or group flick hilarious i give it an a,black_comedy
not since an american werewolf in london has there been a movie so successful in this genre not only a great homage to the classic living dead movies but a flat out hilarious movie to boot this is not resident evil resident evil is a video game even in film form its a video game not a zombie movie not to say re isnt entertaining in its own right but stands proud with the few movies that can make you scream and laugh in the same minute this is destined to be a cult classic one of the greatest scenes is shaun walking through town on his daily routine not realizing he is surrounded by zombies he just doesnt notice it really does look at this situation from your everyman point of view what if this did happen would you be ready with a plan would you have the stuff to survive where would you go what would you eat where would you get beer for fans of the genre this movie has it all scares gore laughs what more could you ask for want a line up of great zombie comedies its a short list but with a case of beer a stack of pizzas and your best buddies it will be fun times for all here ya go check out return of the living dead and the incredibly obscure but tremendously entertaining night of the creeps,black_comedy
if you like your comedy out there and not as boring as most recent movie comedies then this is the one for youtaking its lead from most of hollywoods best horror movies and mixing in the best of british satire self depreciating humour and an excellent soundtrack it is one not to missi defy anyone not to laugh during the record box and queen scenes they are perfect examples of simple ideas used to their absolute bestbuy the dvd and watch it as often as you can you will get something new each and every timeif you havent seen it yet what are you waiting for,black_comedy
well i thought i would watch dawn of the dead before i saw shawn of the dead which a friend told me i should do first my friend from uk saw it and said it was one of the best movies he had seen i am always suspect of uk humor as he was a big monty python fan as well as benny hill and i did not like either one of them anyway in this case he was correct and i did agree shawn was a very good movie it was strange in that i laughed and was scared all in one movie i liked shawn and really felt for him the special effects of the movie were very good and i thought there was more gore blood guts etcthan some of the scenes in dawn of the dead i liked some of the crazy humor but some i thought was stupid it seemed like teenagers really liked the movie in the audience the bottom line is that i was entertained as with dawn this is not a movie to take the kids to,black_comedy
hello all i just got back from seeing this excellent film i was laughing from start to finish i almost blacked out from laughing so hard that i wasnt breathing right it cost me every last cent i had on me im in college but it was worth it i am trying to start up a production company and now we have something to own up to it was probably the best movie since spiderman 2 and the second best movie of the year and one of the top 15 of all timei rarely do this for movies but this is is definitely a ten and four of four starsgod bless,black_comedy
the best horror comedy since ghostbusters dont waste your hard earned cash on crap filled studio films go see this now as soon as i saw the trailer i knew this would be a truly unique film i havent laughed this hard in years the film exceeded my expectations for a zombie film and im a serious romero fan everything was perfectly balanced even the dramatic scenes were pulled off with as much skill as the comedy its sad when films like resident evil which has twice the production budget and doesnt even come close to even coming near to this film well done guys i was so impressed this american is going out to buy a cricket bat congrats to simon pegg you rock im defiantly going to check this one out again,black_comedy
having hugely enjoyed the spaced series here in the uk with its great scripts and at times biting satire i was really looking forward to seeing how pegg would perform on the big screen with his first movie i wasnt disappointed is a winner on two levels firstly as a parody of the zombie genre and secondly as a homage i only hope they dont attempt a sequel which must be tempting given the success of the film as this would clearly be more of the same and would cheapen the original in my eyes however i think pegg and co are smarter than that and wont go down that avenue but hopefully pegg and co will be back on the big screen sooner rather than later it will be interesting to see what genre they decide to tackle next any ideas more please,black_comedy
i had heard a lot of great things about from my friends over in the european countries when i heard that was coming to american theaters i was very excited and could not wait to see this movieadvertises itself as a romantic comedywith zombies shaun has all the elements of american comedies in its first act a great deal of the comedy is how shaun and his friend ed are unaware of what is happening around them since everything seems so routine the movie basically pokes fun at how most of us are just zombies ourselves going through the same routines day after day while the beginning of the movie is a comic fest the second half of the movie is all horror with small touches of humor intertwined the last part of the movie is a true zombie film with all the horrors of dawn of the dead and 28 days combined i was glad that a friend warned me about some of the horror scenes before i had seen the movie why because i would have been under the impression it was a zombie spoof and had taken my eight year old niece to see this movie beware there are beheadings eviscerations flesh being ripped apart and blood and gore i enjoyed a great deal and would recommend it to everyone,black_comedy
the freshest comedy ive seen in agesinstead of turning a comedy into a bit of a zombie movie they made a zombie movie into a comedy does that make sense no gore is spared due to the comedy i watched a few people leave the theatre after the first sign of blood and goo well doneit left me with a taste of office space meets the office meets 28 days later all great in their own right but they pull this off without spoofing it really is a one of a kind piece of work for all those who love dry black comedy and bloody gutsi highly recommend this movie to those looking for some lighthearted bloody good times not recommended for the squeamish or humourless,black_comedy
i wouldnt believe the naysayers who say that shuan of the dead is overrated i think they must have set out to look for bad points in it its everything the hype makes it out to and more this movie is by far the most enjoyable movie ive seen in theaters all year the humor is hilarious the zombie horror is brutal the effects are amazing the direction is wild and kineticthis is one helluva good zombie movie and probably the most original to be made in longggg time so if youre a fan of zombie flicks or if you just thought it looked funny check it out now its worth it shuan of the dead cannot have enough priase bottom line any movie with the recommendations by george romero sam raimi guillermo del toro robert rodriguez and peter jackson cant be that bad,black_comedy
not since anton maidena funny little man with no talent for singing who sings iron maiden songs to midi tracks of their songs hilarious but sad at the same timehas a spoof been so fantastically sad and funny at the same time it is the story of shaunjust like anton a man who is a little bit of a looser he has a complete life with a deadbeat friend in his home a work place where he gets no respect and a girlfriend who is way to good for him but it is all all right because he has the winchester this movie is a must see for all who love zombies andor comedies so if you havent seen it run out and see it or rent it or steal it do what must be done but see it,black_comedy
this is the way a zombie movie should be madeno regular guy turns into superman and saves the world crapnowell deari have a secret identity and the people i work for actually created the reason all our friends are dead moviebut an honest to god regular people deal with incredibly irregular circumstances and with a bit of lucksurvive these people reacted much like i could actually see my friends and relatives being under similar circumstancesyea even the stuff at the endmacabre i knowbut what else to do i liked this movie because it wasnt even close to predictableunlike pretty much all the movies that have come before in this genre for the first time in a very long time i actually wanted to see a movie a second time right awaywell done,black_comedy
im a simple guy and this is a simple movie therefore i can get into this film without feeling ashamed weve got a few simple characters in a simple town filled with simple zombies just trying to eat some flesh simply put this smart british spoof of dawn of the dead has more class and style than weve seen come out of any hollywood scary movieshauns having himself an early midlife crisis and hes so wrapped up in his own problems that he hardly notices that his towns being overrun by flesh eating zombies when he and his flatmate ed finally clue into the recent apocalypse they slightly spring into action attempting to save shauns mom barbara girlfriend liz and hole up in the local tavern of course things get complicated with shauns stepdad liz and her friends and an increasing mass of slowmoving and persistent zombie hordefor a discriminating yet simple moviegoer such as myself theres just so much to like in this movie an amiable regular joe main character you can identify with a flatulent foul speaking sidekick a genuinely sweet girlfriend seeking to advance their relationship a cheerful mom and of course some zombie smashing action with cricket bat and shovel throw in a few hilarious cuts from action to inaction brilliance to idiocy and really theres not much more you can ask for in a movie theres little in the way of actual scares but there just didnt need to be although not stupidly naive about the situation these characters deal with the crisis in a light hearted but task oriented way mind you they dont always think aheadbottom line if you like british humor and an extra mild serving zombie frights you owe it to yourself to be entertained by,black_comedy
im going to keep this short and sweet is a great film its funny scary and most of all just a great time to be had if youre a fan of horrorzombie flicks i highly recommend it especially if youre one of the dawn of the deadromero lot as i am and sick of cheap rips at zombie horror like rea and cabin fever i cant really say enough good things about shaun but there is one problem its too damn short i guess its just like any good thing youll leave wanting more i dont think it takes away from shaun but the movie really had me craving more laughs and definitely more locales great film though go see it and you wont be disappointed810,black_comedy
name a comedy other than bad santa of recent years you actually laughed your ass off i couldnt think of any other than bad santa but had me rolling all over the placeshaun is a typical loser kinda guy they should have had him for the jon role in garfield whos dumped by his girlfriend because he always takes her to his favorite pub instead of some classy restaurant then theres problems with his roommate who doesnt accept the fact his sloppy and lazy best friend ed is living with thembut worse things are about to happen as suddenly there appears to be a lot of zombies wandering the streets oh well lets have a cuppa tea firstthe now legendary recordsscene second coming yeah well i liked it is just one example of some hilarious scenes too many to remember really im sure gonna watch it again one of these daysthe movie kinda slows down in its last third but by then youve seen more convincing zombies and heard more jokes and puns than any other movie of recent years other than bad santaone to watch 810,black_comedy
does exactly what it says on the tin its a romantic comedy about zombies yes thats correct  and very funny it is to  i just hope you yanks actually get this film i wholly deserves to be ranked as at least 8 on imdb with myself giving a fleshy 9 hey its not perfect the ending could have been a little more polished and tamed down  dont worry not a spoiler  but funny non the less best bits again not spoilers inability of the characters to kill  shoot  hit anythingall in all take your bird and youll both enjoy  the dvd extras should be good to,black_comedy
this film is a must for anyone who has seen the original dawn of the dead or day of the dead  what i mean this film is a must for anyone who has a sense of humour at all it is hilarious horrific and the best brit flick ever as i say though this film will be a slightly funnier film to anyone who has seen dawn original or day of the dead there are many funny references to both films most notably a piss take of bub from day of the deadbut ill leave it therethis film is definitely in my top 5  nay top 2 films that i have ever seen and it aint second best buy it rent it or borrow it from a pal who has it watch this film and be engrossed by it as well as grossed out by it1010  the best film everprobably,black_comedy
i loved this movie im a big zombie fan and i appreciated the return to slowmoving prostheticladen dangerous zombies none of that fancy cgi runningchoppy editing stuff for me i adored all of the injokes to past horror classics like night of the living dead but the humor was way more than injokes theres a clever morrisey cameo a bit with old lps and many many more i worry when people say the humor is too british but i think it translates just fine there was maybe one joke that americans like myself couldnt get something to do with ice cream but one joke out of manynot a huge loss slackers are pretty much the same the world overwhat really stuck with me about this movie was the fantastic characters simon pegg is a great comedic actor  his timing and facial expressions are just spoton hes a charming hero that audiences will cheer for and you will cheer for shaun and his best buddy ed this is the best romantic comedy with zombies since dead alive peter jacksons best horror film thats a bold statement but its true shaun is quirky fun with a few scares and tons of laughs id definitely watch this again and again,black_comedy
this film is incredible its both hilarious and scary and actually pulls it off just like braindead did 12 years before except is way way funnier thankfully they didnt forget about scares and reduce it to a army of darkness level though shaun is a down on his luck guy with not much going his way his girlfriend dumped him hes in a deadend job and although being a complete mommys boy he doesnt get along with her husband at all and now on top of all that hes got an entire town of zombies to battle this plot just leaves everything open for as much classic british comedy as possible i havent laughed this hard since monty python and the holy grail from trying to pass as zombies using dire straights records as weapons the laughs absolutely seep from this classic british filmyou might be thinking this sounds like it couldent possibly have much gore in it and i pretty much thought the same thing but i was pleasantly surprised at some of the bloody kills in it especially one that rivaled day of the dead of messes but youll just have to see the film to find out what it is but oh course the gore doesnt reach a braindead level as the main emphasis is on the laughs but that doesnt mean gore hounds wont be pleased the comic acting is top notch as most of the actors come from the british comedy scene the direction is really well made as well there isnt any cheap hollywood shaky filming its all clear but fast and works perfectly in the action scenes a few of the scenes were great homages to the romero trilogy and that only improved on an already great film its not one to be forgotten and its definitely one ill be getting on dvd as soon as it comes out so go and see it and get ready for a good laugh and a good scare,black_comedy
i could have sworn i wrote a comment here when the film was out in the cinema but i cant find it so i guess i didntim a massive fan of spaced so when i first heard about this film i was spectacularly excited and literally bounced in my seat every time i saw a trailerso with such high expectations it was quite a feat for the film not to let me down in the slightest  quite the opposite it was instantly one of my favourite ever filmsive never seen a zombie film so you dont necessarily need to get the references to enjoy it its just brilliantly funnysimon pegg and dylan moran are 2 of my absolute favourite actors so obviously i loved their performances and lucy davis was fab as ever but basically everyone is right on top of their form  not a single false notethen of course there was the long wait for the dvd to come out once i had it in my hands i was a little nervous that it wouldnt live up to my memory of just a few months earlier but i neednt have worried  i watched it twice in a row and then all the extrasi simply cant recommend it highly enough and im so excited that so many americans here are enjoying it too  i so hope it is as big a hit as it deserves to be over there and shows that some british films are this good and i recommend spaced just as highly,black_comedy
with recent drivel including love actually notting hill bridget jones and the like giving the impression that the only successful british movies are bland romantic comedies featuring hugh grant its not only refreshing to see a film like bucking the trend its also refreshing to see a british film being so damned goodpaying respectful homage to the work of george romero rather than parodying and poking a mean finger at the daddy of the zombie genre is a film that combines comedic brilliance genuine jumps and believable romance in a very complete packagethe cast features the cream of british comedy including stars of shows such as the office black books the league of gentlemen and of course spaced the writing is impeccable and edgar wrights brilliantly energetic direction gives the film all the impact of a hollywood blockbuster without the budgetif this doesnt achieve the success it deserves at the box office the moviegoing public frankly has no right to complain ever again about the output of the studios,black_comedy
first off let me say that im not british many people keep thinking that americans wont get this movie do to some british tv references im 100 american and i thoroughly enjoyed this movie even though a few references went over my head if anything these references made me want to watch more bbc specifically this british series spaced which is made by the same people the movie is a horror and a comedy so for every laugh there is a quite a bit of bloodshed the dialogue is well written and quite funny even though its hard to understand their accents at first i would recommend sorry for the spelling this for everybody 15 16 and older just because of the harsh use of language,black_comedy
i managed to catch a sneak peek here in the us tonight and has skyrocketed to the top five in my favorite zombie movies ever this movie has it all as many laughs as the evil dead trilogy some awesome gore and most surprisingly amazing performances simon pegg and nick frost are the standouts as shaun and ed two dimwitted losers that become unlikely heroes when a zombie plague ravages england if youre thinking 28 days later sounds very similar thats where the similarities end shaun becomes determined to save his exgirlfriend liz and his mother while trying to win back the formers love a movie with both humor and heart is just amazing on so many levels it has a killer soundtrack some sidesplitting laughs references a million different zombie classics and most surprisingly plausible dramatic and touching moments wheras most zombie movies have the typical yellingcryingwhatever this one really works these people can really act if you didnt have the chance to catch it in the states tonight definitely go out and see it next week four stars,black_comedy
i liken seeing to a lifechanging experience  youll never look at zombies movies the same way again following right in the footsteps of such esteemed flicks as evil dead 2 and brain dead tells the story of loser shaun his nagging girlfriend his even bigger loser friend and flatmate and the rest of his friends and family as he stumbles through a zombie outbreak at times literally the humor ranges from broad leafing through albums to decide which are low enough quality to be thrown at advancing zombies heads to more subtle touchesas shaun sits on the bus and observes a pedestrian mysteriously collapse the passenger behind him plays the techno song zombie nationthe pace is quick the gore is more than acceptable and the jokes never misses a beat if you enjoy movies about brits beatin on zombies just so they get down to the pub see this movie and see it even if you dont1010,black_comedy
there has been a glut of zombie movies lately so when this turned up i honestly didnt have high expectations ive never seen spaced so im not familiar with the actorswriters so the movie was an incredible surprise for me incredibly enjoyable with wit bubbling up in the places youd least expect it one can describe this as a parody of both zombie and british slacker films but i dont really view sotd as a spoof seeing as how both genres are known for their selfsatire the genius is its bringing together the slacker and zombie models in one movie its incredibly funny but oddly poignant too much like the first dawn of the dead,black_comedy
let me tell you somethingthis is a must see filma fantastichumorousterrific display of comedy and pure witwith a pretty good storywhich you dont find out exactly till the endbut thats not why you watch it you may find some spoilers in herewith quote such as were coming to get you barbara and many similarities to romeros dead trilogyincluding obviouslythe zombiesthis is an amazing comedy from the minds of comic geniuss it has a better feel to it because its not an american based film with american style camera and languagebrilliant acting ed will have you erupting like an enormous volcano of laughterthe part where shaun walks to the shop and doesnt even notice the pedestrians sprinting in terrorand the zombies stalking him while he goes really makes you think theyre not that dangerous but when they are up close in the barand shaunlized think theyre safewhen zombie come through the swivel doorshaun shouts out exactly what your thinkingohgive us a fg breakthey arent that harmless any moreshaun and ed produce hilarious linesa lot of them written by themselves i believesuch as where they are throwing things at the two corpses in their gardenand flick through their recordswhile deciding which ones to through such as saying brilliant dialogue such as no thats a classic and well i like it grumpy peteyou must see the extra funky pete feature on the dvd version plays a great part as a wait for itgrumpy personand a great big killjoy who gets what he deservesyou can see why hes so angry thougha fantastic performance by allwith great sceneryand some music taken from the dead trilogy itselfthe ending is a little blandbut apart from thatworking title have shown us yet another gemwell done to everyone involveda certain 10 starsno doubt,black_comedy
thank god for this having been many zombies i can say this is a gorgeous film nothing i can tell you will help it doesnt need it go see this immediately george take note someone got it and really good cheers to the writing most of all resident evil 2 has nothing on this makeup fx are perfect story perfect acting perfect i cannot recommend this film enough the bit with the records and thats all i should say is wonderful shauns discovery of the phenom plays great,black_comedy
im amused by the reviewers that have used this fine film as a chance to take shots at americans and american moviegoers brilliantly done folkswell im an american and i loved this movie my comments echo the positive sentiments of previous posters it is funny endearing and refreshingly sincere without taking itself too seriously i hope it will be a hit in america and am doing my the best to spread the wordofmouth campaign here in the states nonamericans may be shocked to learn that many americans in fact detest the tripe that hollywood turns out and yearn for creative films that show freedom of thought and irreverent wit is just that type of film i dont know if it will be an instant hit or a cult classic but it is a funny clever movie that i found thoroughly enjoyable i highly recommend it,black_comedy
great film many themes very funny some scenes very gory very british some great music jokes very clever uses of using the breakdown of society as a metaphor for a broken relationship a chick flick for men in the same way hifidelity wasi am sure i will watch this again and again i should add that the extras on the dvd are superbwill,black_comedy
i wasnt expecting anything from this movie since i had never heard of it before but i was pleasantly surprised by the humor i agree that the tone sometimes changes from serious to silly but for this is one of the better spoof movies without being completely over the top they remind me a little bit of the simpsons in the way that they do reversal humorafter seeing this i went and rented the tv series spaced which was done by this same group great stuff all around i want to try and find hippies too but havent seen it out there i noticed a lot of the same crew from spaced was in which was nice for those in the know if you like subtle humor go see this movie,black_comedy
a few people here seem to be having trouble with this movie containing more than just comedy or horror elements if you have to pigeonhole all films you see into one category then fine but pegg  wright have cooked up an affectionate homage to not a parody of zombie movies including making some nice social satire comments yes the movie also  bravely but successfully  has sudden bursts of moving drama is this really too much to accept in a horror or comedy movie where some great characters have been created that you should find yourself caring even more about what is going on if this is too much to cope with stick with the scary movie series  sotd is much better quality stuff it is worth all the praise that has been heaped upon it and subsequent viewings are rewarded too,black_comedy
at last a british comedy without having poncy british men incapable of wooing a certain lady until the final scene in a nutshell has to stand as one of the best films to come from this country ever full stop one things for sure simon pegg and edgar wright are naturally gifted comics and always produce the goods with panachetheyve also produced a film that contains constant humour from start to finish whilst involving horror romance scares and plenty of emotion capturing that balance to perfection and displaying great timing and diversity makes this film purely enjoyable and a breath of fresh airsimon pegg deserves applauding for showing hes not only a superb comic but a sublime actor as wellbut like every film it may not be for certain tastes however for me its a recommendation to everyone hell i even made my dog watch itlike go check it out,black_comedy
i may not be very old im only 15 but out of all the repeats of the carry on films and other british comedies this has got to be the best film i have seen in a long time i havent even seen spaced and had not actually heard about it before this film came out but from other zombie films i have seen 28 days later evil dead and a few others this is definitely a wellrounded play on every zombie film out there i love it and one of my favourite pieces is when the gang is trying to get into the winchester and eds phone goes off how dumb can he be to answer a phone when he should be acting like a zombie in the midst of lots of zombies i also like it when the news reporter is saying that everyone must not panic so what do shaun and ed do when they see a zombie scream and run outside and how do they get rid off this walking plague throw lps at it in the vain hope one will pierce the skull and kill it outright a quote i found here that i love ised  stone roses  shaun  no  ed  second coming  shaun  i liked it  ed  dire straits  shaun  chuck itand another ised  its not hip hop its electro and whats with the 78 out of 10 i gave it 10 out of 10 five stars 100 and every other top mark you can give it for a comedy filmoh yeah anddavid  were in a pub whatre we going to do now  ed  get a round in,black_comedy
i have just seen this and quite frankly cannot believe how good it wasfor years now british humour has suffered from the emergence of lots alleged talents who under the banner of alternative humour have forced suffering audiences to sit through movies that were anything but funnythis movie is funny this movie is creepy this movie is a 100 classic good time which pays tributes to thesometimes not very good films of romero and raimi but then goes beyond these limitations to provide a story in which you actually care for the characters its clever that like the hero of night of the living dead the lead character may not be doing the right thing and even this pans out in a clever waycaptain fkind wow indeed see this movie before you realize you are dead,black_comedy
didnt really expect to enjoy this movie  zombies yawn there was the scifi element and im a scifi freak but that was a very minor component give me a good thriller or action moviei think it has something to do with shaun being the epitome of todays confused male his inner confusion is expressed in his outer life  he is hardly in control of anything his job his life his relationship with his girlfriend zombies taking over the world its just a logical extension of what he has come to expectthe others in the gangoffive  his childlike awkward friend ed the straightlaced dianne and david and the spunky liz perfectly compliment the humorous situation as the day wears on and the zombie menace comes to a climaxtheatreofthe absurd perhaps but somehow it just got me in  i laughed throughout the film and thoroughly enjoyed itjr movie fiend,black_comedy
if you dig good old fashioned romeroesque zombie horror or comedy or both go see this film its brilliant absolutely brilliantif you want to get the most out of this film avoid the trailers like the fricking plague in my opinion the american trailers give away waaaay too much and also make the film look dumb at the end of the trailer because it makes you think its a different kind of movie luckily ive already seen a screeningi assure you people this movie is of the utmost quality go see it and after youve seen it see it again when this comes to theaters everywhere ill be definitely seeing it more than once,black_comedy
i was a little skeptical about the title but after i saw the preview it looked soooo good i was no where dissatisfied the acting writing and cinematography were very well done most definitely a movie worth seeing again and again my prediction  instant cult hit my personal favorite scene was when two of the protagonists shaun and his closest friend ed were stumbling home drunk after a rough breakup with girlfriend liz as they are walking home singing they stumble into a zombie sounds like it could be a disastrous encounter right no it turns into a quick musical duet between two drunkards and the groanings of a manhungry zombie hope you like it,black_comedy
the plot revolves around 29 year old shaun who has a dead end job and gets dumped by his girlfriend liz because their relationship has hit a rut his life is going nowhere and his best mate ed is no help offering clichs like its not the end of the world turns out it sort of is the undead are all around and theyre hungry shaun formulates a plan to rescue liz and his mother and live happily ever after but the theory is a lot more straightforward than the practiceshaun is extremely funny and surprisingly moving at times the heroes arent perfect they dont lead charmed lives and they dont solve the crisis in fact shaun is so absorbed in his own problems that he doesnt notice whats going on around him until hes attacked by a zombie in his back garden i had the good fortune to see this film on holiday in england over easter and ive been counting down the days until the dvd release if youre not adverse to a bit of gore i highly recommend this film i went on the basis of features and reviews in movie mags i had never watched spaced where a lot of the castcrew worked together before but after seeing shaun i was hookedthe film itself is the best ive seen this year and the dvd is an anoraks paradise theres 4 commentaries lots of behind the scenes stuff and an excellent plotholes what happened next storyboardseek it out and enjoy yourself,black_comedy
a fitting tribute to all zombie moviesthis film is fantastic its funny its scary and at one point kind of sad simon pegg and edgar wright have made a masterpiece right here and may they make many more being a big fan of horror movies i could barely wait to see sotd and i wasnt disappointed besides being a superb tribute it is a superb movie in its own rightthe acting camera work make up etc are all well up to scratchthis is well worth not just one few but 50 if only to find all the in jokes and references to movies like evil dead and others,black_comedy
before viewing i considered bernardo bertoluccis the dreamers to be the best film in the continuing year of 2004 usa release year now i am not too sureyes a romantic comedy with zombies  as the tagline states  may very well end up being the best film i have seen this year and i find that incredibly refreshing from the opening nod to george romeros dawn of the dead to a downright absurd final shot blazes a clear path into horror parody via social satire obvious shots of shaun staggering out of bed to go to work to his bus ride packed with equally spacedout passengers work surprisingly well thanks to our knowledge of what is to come in fact the humor of the first act relies almost entirely on that knowledge as when ed threatens his roommate pete during an argument with and the next time i see you youre dead i can only wonder how those scenes would play to someone unaware of the films title and subject matteronce the characters finally catch up with the audience the film moves comfortably into horror territory with equal amounts of practicality and absurdity when shaun and his best friend ed encounter their first zombies in the garden they begin by tossing random objects at their heads to kill them everything from toasters to shauns prized vinyl collection and when that doesnt work its off to the shed for a shovel and cricket bat from that point on every move shaun makes for his own survival makes complete sense even it rarely works out for comedic purposesin its final act the film does grow surprisingly dark as some characters meet less than pleasant fates but that doesnt hinder the hilarious epilogue a two minute epilogue that takes one last jab at our society and perceived humanitybetter than 28 days later  the dawn of the dead remake is most importantly an instant classic and i cant wait to see it againrating on a 5 star system  4 12 stars,black_comedy
right a bit of a statement i know but i think it is the problem with most comedies is there american humor which when first seen ill admit can be funny but watching justin long get hit in the face with a ball over and over again is only funny once dodgeball english humor has the ability to make you laugh at it over and over again not only is the film funny but the love story at the heart of is also brilliant its not the sappy everything has a happy beginning and ending story i mean this is a regular boring guy who girlfriend wouldnt have thought about it again if it wasnt for the hoards of zombies oh and the timing of all the characters is superb so there you funniest film ever,black_comedy
i saw a preview last night and thought the movie was incredibly funny and smart in its comedic touches the timing of the actors delivery was great and added to the funny scriptbecause of the title i was a bit worried that this was going to be a movie in the genre of scary movie im not a fan of that series of movies and i was very pleasantly surprised that this was a different type of movie and a much better one at thatfor those wondering how the movie will work in the us i think the audience reaction says it all the entire audience laughed any times they had a great time and gave a standing ovation to the actorswritersdirector in attendance for the promotional tour as was said last night comedy is universal,black_comedy
first there was spaced a master piece of modern comedy the very pinnacle of everything that is a sitcom now edgar wright and simon pegg have managed to out do themselves once again with this gem of zombie movie making romero himself said it was the best zombie movie hed seen since he made his own it was like they were reading our minds just when we stopped laughing and calmed down perhaps had a cup of tea after the hilarious zombie episode of spaced with vulva arrives on the seen not only hilarious not only classic zombie but also fantastically acted good job nick frost and beautiful to behold see the pub seen with ed comforting shaun after his breakupour only question now is a sequel whilst pegg and wright do indeed rule and rule with an iron fist could they do it justice perhaps time will tell but for now i cant wait to look out for them made up as zombies in romeros new movie land of the dead where they deservedly will be immortalised by the man that spawned a legacy of amazing movies including this one,black_comedy
you have to see this movie you actually walk out of the theater with a smile on your face and knowing that the price of admission was well spent not to mention some fantastic music like queen for instance simon pegg and nick frost are excellent and edgar wrights direction is perfect if you see one movie this year let it be this one you wont be disappointed these guys obviously put there heart and souls in its what i call a masterpiece of horror and comedy simon edgar and nick are big fans of the genre and they pay tribute to romeros zombie films and comedy alike but in a very tasteful way trust me i know classic horror movies and this one will be a classic dont miss it watch for the pool stick beating scene,black_comedy
its not very of that a film lives up to its tagline but really is a romantic comedy with zombies not only that but its the best romantic comedy with zombies since braindead peter jacksons early brilliant gore movie the uk doesnt do many decent films these days but we are developing a nice niche in comedypostmodern horror movies dog soldiers 28 days later and now are three of the best horror movies of recent years the former and later especially brilliantly pay homage to while sending up their genre is very very funny especially if youve seen plenty of zombie movies and british quirky sitcoms as well as funny though it is also cleverly and at times quite gruesomely a horror film in fact it is not just one of the best zombie movies of recent years but one of the best movies full stop,black_comedy
im a brit my wife is a yankee weve watched this three times on video and twice made it the star of little movie night gatherings with friends its been a huge hit and everyone is going to see it when it comes out hereits funny where it should be its gory its funny its exciting its funny its not scary at all its funny and its funnyits a completely fresh take on horror comedy made by people who love horror films it never stops being original and unlike x number of hollywood comedies almost all the jokes are actually funny a lot of them zoom by so fast youll miss them first time round its also one of those rare comedies that you want to say again immediately after youve just watched itone word of warning though there are no naked breasts at all sorry,black_comedy
i had a chance to see in cinema when i was visiting friends in edinburgh it is an example of how a horror movie should be made see almost any hollywood horror movie from the past few years for examples of how not to ironically i am moving to the uk just before the north american premier of its a shame because i would certainly see it the cinema again i urge anyone and everyone to see this movie if you like zombie flicks go and see it if you enjoy comedy go and see it if you just saw another bad horror villain vs horror villain tragedy of a film you must see dont miss it,black_comedy
i was quite surprised by this movie i saw 28 days later and dawn of the dead just before it 28 days and dawn had some entertainment value but i didnt think they were good in the end they were just action moviestried to be a parody on those films and it does a really great job at the same time it also manage to be a better zombie flick than the other two the zombies acts like zombies they dont run etcand the humor in the movie is english and isnt overdone nor overacted killingscenes are also very good and graphical and no toofastforyoureyesactionhollywoodscenes good work 910,black_comedy
saw this movie at a screening last night  it was fantastic  great humor  a bit bloody for my taste but they did warn you with the r ratingthe screening included a chat with the director and stars one was the cowriter  they are charming english chaps  selfadmitted geeks you can tell they had a lot of fun making this movie and it shows on screeneven if you think you are not into zombiehorror stuff  give it a try take a chance on something different  not mainstream  it wont kill you  lol kj,black_comedy
i guess we are seeing many zombies walking to workplaces in many cities especially in the morning time perhaps i am already one of them without noticing it life in the time of bad economyvery funny lowbudgeted zombie movie which many brit spaced fans would feel excited about i find it interesting but not exciting as the brits think in the last 80s to 90s hong kong tv and filmmakers have produced a great number flicks of the genre for example xin jiang shi xian sheng mr vampire 1992 xi wo yi ge wen the romance of the vampire try the chinese zombies movies you may find lots of funny differences and similarities i am wondering if a brit zombie is able talk to a chinese vampire perhaps they will speak to each other a common language the dead language last but not least its lovely to see so many familiar and seasoned brit actors appear in the film,black_comedy
did 28 days later leave you feeling lifeless did everything but the first ten minutes of dawn of the dead the remake make you want to write a letter of apology to george a romero did you enjoy love actually but felt like it was missing a decapitation or two have you been waiting all your life to see a movie that blends love and carnage and isnt love carnage actually no apologies need be offered for a laughoutloud deadon homage to every firstrate classic zombie movie ever madeevery guy can empathize with shaun a twentysomething nogetter whose idea of a romantic getaway with his girl is slugging down a few pints nightafternight at the local pub when the zombies walk the earth will shaun be able to save the world keep his girl and get back to the pub before last callis the crest of the new wave of the zombie genre i couldnt wipe the   eating grin off my face as i walked out of the theatre put your money on the counter and enjoy this pint poured by a talented group of blokes cheers,black_comedy
it was a funny movie but if you havent seen any zombie flicks recentlyare not a fan then you are not going to be as amused as some others have posted here i have seen zombie movies a couple of years back and i like them though since it was too long ago i probably missed a lot of inside jokes which would make this movie great so to people not in the know of zombie movies i would say go out and see more of them before you go see this movie or it will not be as greatthe zombies where great slow moving and only really dangerous in great numbers or when they surprise you as they should be,black_comedy
ive seen many zombie flicks in my days but noone surprised me like this movie it has everything well written well directed well acted extremly funny and very good  as its a low budget movie im astounded the scene were shaun goes to the little grosery store for the second time is very very funny im very curious about how they did the girl with the hole in the stomach i mean it looks so good is it really a low budget or whatin conclusion anyway this is this years or even the last ten years funniest comedy it is of course a horror flick causewell it has zombies in it but the horror is not as often as the laughs but it doesnt matter the film is somewhat of a miracleokey now im rambling but as final word this one rules see it,black_comedy
is the funniest film ever madeit is about a man called shaun with a deadend job a sloppy roommate ed and a love life thats falling apart when suddenly he wakes up one morning to find his town mobbed with zombieshe ventures through the monsters with ed to save his exgirlfriend and his mother but ends up also having to pick up his girlfriends friends and his stepdad who is turning into a zombie they hide in a pub where they need to fend for their lives using cricket bats snooker cues spades swing ball poles and a winchester riflebest bit shaun going to the corner shop whilst not noticing the bloodbath1010,black_comedy
4 outta 5 starsdefinitely the best movie in the living dead genre since the original dawn of the dead  even though the movie is a comedy the humour comes from the characters of the people who find themselves in the midst of a zombie invasion the zombies themselves are as creepy and as deadly as in the george a romero originals  shaun an aging english working man afraid to grow up into a mature adult and having girlfriend trouble as a result wakes up one day to find london being overrun with flesheating zombies this might just be the chance he is looking for to make something of himself in the eyes of his girl if he can just avoid being eaten  this isnt a silly spoof in the style of the scary movie series  it is a genuinely effective mix of laughter and suspense  british actors are so great at portraying these working class characters and making them funny and also easy to identify with  from the opening strains of the specials single ghost town the movie seems to do everything right and there are so many ways it could conceivably go wrong  much as i enjoyed the recent dawn of the dead remake this movie is clearly the zombie movie of the year also its nice to see the oldstyle zombies again slow lurching and relentless,black_comedy
praise be a britcom from people with tv backgrounds that has an actual story rather than playing like a string of sketches  the injokes and nods to fans of spaced are there in their hundreds but can be disregarded altogether without any apparent effect on the enjoyment factor it really is gratifying to see a film from fairly modest origins so smartly assembled in most departmentsits also pleasing to see aspirations that go beyond the limited confines of its genre i would classify this as a comedy first and foremost but whats majorly impressive is that the horror elements are so scarcely the butt of the jokes it must have been tempting to slide into parody at times but generally the makers take great pains to avoid that potentially lazy avenue here its such a clever meld of genres that it represents the birth of a whole new category  the romzomcomthe scale of laughter was gradually progressive in my case beginning with wry smiles to small chuckles and on occasion allout guffaws this is one of those watches where the whole thing gets more enjoyable as it goes along the small details i actually often found funnier than the obvious oneliners witness the cornershop scene id call it charactercomedy at its best because we get so attached to the principles it becomes a sort of bonding ritual to laugh at the many foibles that are purposely brought to our attention in the early setup scenes by the denouement youll be rooting for shaun and his slacker mates to triumph because the depiction of their humdrum lives shattered is probably very much like how it would be in our own casesif a slogan were to be plucked from this review for the purposes of advertising im open to offers  minimal charge id have no regrets about being shamelessly cheesy enough to label as being the freshest comedy treat of 2004 810 or  in profile ratings system,black_comedy
as a big fan of spaced and simon pegg in general i had high expectations for this film expectations which it could be argued were of such insatiable magnitude that they could not possibly be satisfiednaturally they were exceededi just saw it tonight as part of the san diego comiccon this film is fried gold ladies and gentlemen simon pegg edgar wright nick frost et al have made the funniest horror film or the scariest comedy of all time plus seeing tyres as a zombie was worth the price of admission or wouldve been if it hadnt been freesee this movie,black_comedy
i was practically giddy watching this film as a zombie movie despite being a comedy this film really is the one ive been waiting for ever since discovering the romero classics in high school it truly is the smartest most reverent and possibly best zombie movie made since day of the dead maybe even dawn of the dead  yes i realize thats a form of heresy the key here is that everything was just done so right as a comedy it works the performances are very strong especially in our main lead you never really feel that the characters only reason to exist is to set up a zombie punchline the writing is fluid and clever and you care about shaun and his friends tooits also important to point out that although this is a comedy it is not a parody although there are some hilarious occasionally satirical moments the film is predominantly straight it simply treats itself as a sincere british bluecollar comedy as invaded by bonafide romerozombies there is nothing completely absurd or slapstick here the circumstances are deadly earnest all the situations are wonderfully reminiscent of those fleeting daydreams we all have had after seeing dawn of the dead applying the possibilities of zombie attack to our own mundane realities where would you hide where would you find a weapon who would you save would you crack under pressure or would you be a real survivor add to this that the zombies themselves are actually quite pathetic obstacles more than true threats yes thats right slow zombiesive long held that fast zombies are an aberration going for the cheap fright and ignoring what zombies are really all about fast zombies are like werewolves that shoot lasers out of their eyes sure its more dangerous more scary but it misses the point its good to see here that the spirit of the romero zoms is being kept er aliveoverall a solid film and as a genre homage brilliant this one really rises out of the mire of the zombieretreads weve seen lately a mustsee,black_comedy
for me anyway is a masterpiece i may sound a bit strange because i love most zombie films anyway but really tickled my funnybone i think the reason for this is that simon pegg is a real comedy genius and shows what im sure any average english or any other nationality for that matter would do in that sort of situation i also saw 28 days later and i thought this was fab and because had a higher budget which would turn it into another zombie film which is like every other film the writing is perfect and the stars although not recognisable to anyone other than british people are spoton and provide a blackcomic film which i really enjoyed this film is fab and should be seen whether youre into the genre or not,black_comedy
this film is one of the best films i have seen for a long time made me laugh and cry due to the amount of laughter sincere thanks and gratitude to mr pegg and mr frost for the brilliant plot and how well the movie was made certainly a valuable watch this is one of those films that you could keep watching and never get bored of this films genius is how present hollywood films should be made with a lot of care and attention to detail it would be good to have a sequel but i feel this is a once in a lifetimeawaiting the third series of spaced now im buying the dvd when it comes out brilliant movie guyscat courtney x,black_comedy
having read a lot of the reviews on imdb i can see that the film was lost to a lot of people the film was not designed as anywhere near a serious horror movie in fact if you look the word horror isnt really used its described as a romantic zombie film romzomthe film is all about spoofing other films with dozens of references to all the great movies out there and the great writers its also about how real people would deal with the situation albeit real people that are slightly slow on the uptakei highly recommend this film as the best british flick you will see all year a classic piece of comedy zombie and dodgy romance tucked neatly into one enjoyable packagedont expect anything serious leave the grey cells at home and have a night of laughter and enjoymentfantastic work from the man whom made spaced,black_comedy
i saw this one in a sneak preview in our movie theater so i was completely surprised by it this is a true laughoutloud movie even if the zombiething isnt normally your cup of tea there are many reasons to got and watch and see it for yourself first of all the actors do an excellent job in presenting the story as something that could happen to you any day now the jokes keep on getting better during the movie which is a quality many comedies like this lack the boring clichs are avoided ill give you this one our leading man doesnt wake up from a bad dream at the end of the movie you can enjoy both the witty conversations as the horrific moments this movie is brutal original hilarious i cant wait to get this one on dvd,black_comedy
this film rocks its gory exciting scary at times and packed full of cameos and references oh yeah it is also bloody hilarious i wont explain the plot but i will say if you havent seen it yet go now now that was going to be it but the imdb says i have to add a few more lines if you have seen the film loads of times and know it line by line then listen out for the soundtrack theres some really great tracks including white lines by grandmaster flash and ghost town by the specials this is one of those rare comedys that actually is quite atmospheric monty python and the holy grail comes to mind the best british comedy this millennium,black_comedy
if this movie stands the test of time and i am sure it will it will become a classic the comedy elements are very british in style and this is finethe fx are well pretty rubbish really but i am sure this is intentional and actually add to the character of the movieto get some feel for the style of this movie try watching the amazing spaced series awesomely funny and originalno spoilers needed for this a fairly standard zombie flick with a lot of comedy thrown in i loved the way they spin the idea of the apocalypse on its head instead of gun toting gung ho americans we have cricket bat and swingball wielding english folk classicenjoy the movie whilst you do i am off to raid my dads record collection just in case you know ,black_comedy
much has been made about the links to the cult english series spaced however even that aside this film is an excellent parody of the zombie film genre i heard that even george romero was impressed with the way it was done by coincidence ive spent a lot of time this year watching classic zombie films so they were all fresh in my mind when i watched this and it is brilliantly done there are many clever little tributes to various films and yes also self referential moments to the series spaced as well night and dawn of the dead are referenced several times and other films such as 28 days later evil dead and even the clockwork orange not a zombie film but still a classic gets a tribute but even that all aside i think most people will find this film thoroughly enjoyable there are a lot of great one liners and amusing dialogue as the situation itself is hilarious in a way it turns out to be one of the most realistic zombie films to date due to the bumbling ineffective way the protagonist and friends deal with the situation at hand the horror side of the film isnt skipper over either there is a classic zombie film scene at the later end of the film where one of the gang meets his gory demise and at various times shaun himself has to deal deal with those close to him returning from the dead the zombies themselves look very good and the approach of getting fans of spaced to come in as the zombie extras has a resulted in a worryingly realistic zombie mobbeing a tribute to the classics the film features the more familiar slow slightly silly zombies that are a menace only when they catch you by surprise or when in mass numbers which is most of the time rather then the fast on their feet mega aggressive zombies that are more popular these days through films such as the new i hesitate to call it a remake dawn of the dead and 28 days later these zombies often seem quite silly when in smaller numbers and without the element of surprise and this film takes maximum advantage of thatreally i dont think this film could have been any better then it was despite revelling in parody and classic zombie style the film doesnt become predictable and keeps a good pace throughout the same cant really be said for other recent zombie films i have seen in summary for fans of zombie flicks its a classic for spaced fans its a magnificent and i think for everyone else itll still be an enjoyable one to rememberthis is a film definitely going into my dvd collection,black_comedy
dog soldiers28 days laterhaute tensionundeadover the past year or so it seems that just about all of the great horror films have come from everywhere but the usa with the release of that streak seems to want to keep on keepin onladies and gentlemen i do believe that i now have a brand spankin new favorite zombie film ever weve talked about this in a few threads so far this year have it be about the trailer or whatever and i just now got the chance to watch this instant classic tonight when i woke up today i didnt have any intention on view it today but thank god that all of that changed the film starts out somewhat slow a rather odd pacing for a film of this sort we are introduced to all of the characters right off the bat in a way that feels more like a drama or a romantic comedy than any sort of horror film then again as the tagline says it is basically a romantic comedywith zombies starting out i was questioning the way it began but once it was all said and done it made the start of the film just feel perfect to me you had enough of all of the characters by the time the real action started that all of the characters actually meant something to youi appreciate that especially in a film of this sort many filmmakers never take the time to allow the viewer to have any sort of understanding of any of the characters in a film like this with the exception of one or two main starsso yeah a romantic comedywith zombies is basically what we have here and by god its absolutely perfect even at the start when the plot seems to be going at a slower pace there are things in the background letting you know what is to come various little things where you see the zombie epidemic starting up and its just a riot shaun doesnt seem to expect anything and why should he afterall who in their right mind would actually take small details and come to the conclusion that zombies must be a comini cant remember the last time a horror film had such a perfect mixture of well everything laughs a lot of laughs sentimental moments straight up action gore gore and more gore a great script a fantastic and simple plot and every other thing you could ask for its all here and it all comes together unlike any film in recent memory oh yeah the zombies in this filmthey arent kungfu stars they dont run up and down the streets and they arent superhuman what were dealing with here are old school hardcore wanting nothing but your flesh zombies who can hardly stand up or walkjust the way i like emwithout even needing to think about it for even a second without second thoughts this gets an instant 1010 rating from me dawn of the dead house of 1000 corpses house of the dead i dont think so nothing like that can even touch this film its not even a contest hey i loved dawn of the dead just as much as the next guy it was great also but shaun just blows it out of the water in my opinionits weird in shaun i literally do not have a single complaint there wasnt even a character that i hated like there almost always is in a film like this i either flat out loved every character in the film or i loved to hate them if this one is released in theaters here in the usa you can be sure that ill be the first one standing in line i already want to see it on the big screen and i really want the dvd right nowyeah i say its my favorite zombie film but its much more than that also i mean i have the same sort of feeling now that ive seen this film that i had after seeing flicks like big fish and eternal sunshine of the spotless mind earlier this year that feeling being of 100 satisfactiondownload it then watch it in the theater when it comes out here in the usa and then buy the dvdand pray to god for a sequel of some sort or at least another feature film from the duo of simon pegg main star and edgar wright director they also cowrote the script with one another this being their first major feature film so thats all for now im sure ill make more comments on this as the thread goes forward i just wanted to get a few things off my chest before bed hopefully this will get a few of you interested in it just as i helped some people get interested in haute tension undead and eternal sunshine of the spotless mindwe cant allow films like these to go unnoticed,black_comedy
an enjoyable brit comedy that has some nice observations on life in modern london best example being the fact shuan lives in a metropolis with an abundance of places to go but always choses to go out in his dire localgruesome in places plenty of decent laughs and sensibly short made for a far more enjoyable cinema trip than many of the big hollywood efforts ive endured recentlynice touch at the end but i wont spoil itall in all pleasantly surprised,black_comedy
i can not even begin to tell you how much i enjoyed this film imagine a marriage of the best elements of british tv comedies with romeros dead series and you have the characters are all highly memorable and there are so many quick one liners that the film just begs a second viewingthe film also has the honor of featuring a certain someone from a highly popular business comedy series in the uk its so refreshing to see a film maker create a unique vision to this whole sorry comedyhorror genre the scary movie series may be somewhat entertaining but truly are brain dead comedies however is smart gory and a blast from beginning to end this film will have a cult following that is guaranteedsee it,black_comedy
simon pegg is a funny guy why is he funny maybe because hes just so terribly english maybe its just born talent either way is worthy of many peoples viewing originally i wasnt keen on watching this film at the cinema as i am no major fan dont watch them of peggs television efforts like spaced but friends dragged me and although in places my thoughts were correct because sotd is very much like a television movie i was really glad i watched it many laughs and a good spoof on the zombie movie genre the support cast are all in all pretty good and i was happy to see brief cameos by martin freeman of the office and matt lucas of little britain 710,black_comedy
i had been looking forward to see this though i had mixed feelings about it when i saw the trailer i didnt really know what to think but now ive seen the movie i do its brilliant pure entertainment a good laugh with much respect to the horror genre a cute and well brought fun storyline and a very well paced zombie slasher in one thats an amazing achievement i hadnt seen any of the actors before except bill nighy but they all play their characters really well the soundtrack and often fast paced montage sure adds up to the enjoyment of this film last week i saw dawn of the dead the new version which i really enjoyed for the new styletreat and changes in the storyline this film shaun however feels much better on the comedy side and still brings a great homage to the zombie genre if you havent already go and see it yourselves its well worth the time and money,black_comedy
not only the french surprise me with great horror movies but those stiff upperlips have pulled something off is a fresh breath of wind blowing at hurricane speed through movie land the humor is spot on i dont want to give away to much of the movie except this is the kind of movies who are made by the peter jacksons and sam raimi from the future only 1 more thing to say go see this movie the moment you have the chance and forget the dawn of the  dead,black_comedy
fleshbrainstrousers well maybe not the last one but zombies always seem to be after the same thing food i mean dont they ever want employment money wellno they dont actually because zombies have been shuffling in to our cinemas for over fourty years so they should be paid damnit starting off with george a romeros night of the living dead which sorry george i didnt like for me it was too slow i know zombies dont run and it got boring butits a different story altogether its fast funny as hell and can actually get you moved one part in perticular which i will not mention youll have to find out for yourself 29 yearold shaun works 95 in an electric appliance shop one day after deciding that the most romantic place to take your girlfriend out to is the winchester she decides to dump him however the day after all is not what it seems as the undead stumble about fall in to his garden and gets photographed by one of his best mates called ed who else can use records to try and get rid of the undead maybe he should have tryed a bit of des oconner that would have shifted em simon pegg is great in his first major starring role as the antihero shaun but its his best mate ed played brillliantly by nick frost that steals the show his quips and suggestions just come out of the blue i wont give too much away just that shuffle along to the cinema get a big bucket o popcorn and get ready for the funniest hour and fourty minutes of your undeadlife this is an excellent alternative to the other zombie movies out there but i will say this is isnt as gory as the other movies,black_comedy
the hero shaun shares a house in a tacky london suburb with his best mate who is a slob and another 30 year old man who is normal  they are immersed in the local pub culture and this together with his unreliability causes shauns attractive girl friend to dump him  at this point a virus descends on the country turning huge numbers of people into aggressive zombies shaun rises to the occasion and all ends more or less happily  this is a wonderfully funny film the best comedy i have seen for many many years the dialogue crackles though a nonbritish audience may miss some of the jokes and nuances  however film enthusiasts will not miss the amusing references to other films notably to man bites dog when the two teams meets and to the 39 steps hitchcock ending,black_comedy
boys this movie rocks it is a peculiar really british sort of a gory comedy a fun zombie movie that it is full of blood and drama insideit is the story of a clerk that become a hero and at last find the courage to front his girlfriend and win her love losing his mom and his best friends in doing so it is also a very good approach to the usual zombie film  the classical one this time no running berserkers here but the old slow brainless cannibal beasts that george romero used to become the legend he is after 28 days later here is another little gem from the isles and the final scene with the queen music on background is a great idea  after all most of us are already zombies in our normal life,black_comedy
advertised as the best and only romzomcom youll ever see this film was intended as a spoof on dawn of the dead the old one  the fact it came out about the same time as the remake just a coincidence but it does so much more than that  great to see a britfilm that actually lives up to expectations i cant remember the last time a film made me laugh so many times i have to say i didnt expect simon peggs style of comedy to translate to the big screen very well he and many of the other actors are much better known for tv work but this film was fantastic if you enjoy laughing til you cry this film is for you although i think sotd is only on general release in the uk i advise anyone download it mail order it do whatever it takes to watch this movie 1010,black_comedy
at first when i heard the title i thought it was going to be a lame parody of the george a romero film in the style of the scary movie trilogy however upon finding out it was written simon pegg and edgar wright i decided to give it a go being a fan of spacedhaving now watched it twice and intending to go back for a third helping you can tell i enjoyed it maybe the humour isnt for everyone  like spaced you either get it or you dont  but it is certainly worth going to see okay so you dont expect to see lavish sets and milliondollar effects shots but thats not what this film is about its trying to make us laugh while making us think about how our society has become zombified in the process of our mundane repetitive lives very much like the original dawn of the dead didlook around you next time see how like the shambling zombies a lot of people have become aimlessly wandering from place to place blank expressions on their facesfantastic use of limited sets script got a bit loose in places but the little jokes in the film for spaced fans as well as the great oneliners just make the film for mei give it 910 have a banana,black_comedy
this has to be the most unique zombie film ever it combines elements of your typical date movie and elements of your typical zombie film with fluid storytelling excellent way to portray the ignorance and lack of courage of people in technologicallyadvanced modern societies it is displayed as both ironic and horrific the lack of socialpolitical and emotional awarness by the characters is at times fun to watch and at others most disturbing a great contrast the actors are excellent the gore is gruesome yet not focused upon heavilya good thing the speed of the film makes for a very realistic portrayl of an apocalytic event which causes the audience to find theirselves laughing over the jokes and missing others a great way to get us to watch it again but the theme is very serious and very relevant to our times despite the humorous situations,black_comedy
i confess i am a massive fan of spaced so came at this with some high expectations that were not disappointedi have to agree that this film is quintessentially english like the long good friday the ladykillers etc and is none the worse for itunlike most other recent brit comedies it makes no attempt to internationalise its content it also has a number of people with dead end jobs unlike all of the richard curtis films which i love by the way which tend to be populated with the landed classes wealthy middle class professionals or eccentrics this film has working class characters in suburbiait is a perfect parody of zombie films and also the occasional numbness of english existence  i particularly enjoyed the inability of any of the characters to shoot straight in direct contrast to most hollywood horrors where one shot stops seem to be the order of the dayi wont spoil it for those who havent seen it but it has one of the funniest scenes even screened involving zombies and a record collectionit is a miracle that it got funding and was filmed  this is exactly what the british film industry needs more ofps keep an eye out for those cameos,black_comedy
this was a brilliant film i must say i thought it would be a bit better couple of more jokes and stuff but it was very good it was a horror a comedy a suspense and most importantly a british film the right actors were definately chosen although they could have replaced ed with bill bailey to complete the whole black books circle but nick frost was still brilliantthe directing was was bloody good as well the fast shots of someone doing something like going to the toilet were just great very well done by the director i think also very well acted i also admire the time they took to make this they had to make the film in a short time from when they found out a remake of dawn of the dead was in production and to the opening of it i was very impressed with the effects directing acting story and most of all the conclusion that the dead were awaken by radioactive monkeys i tip my hat to you4 stars    ,black_comedy
 i get too involved too upset and too freaked out by gore so horror is the only film genre that i avoid like the plaguethis film  however  looked special enough for me to brave the trauma and im so glad i did  even if i was curled up in a ball with my hands over my face for a fair proportion of the film  sorry by the way to all those in the cinema who got a few extra frights from the wee stifled squealing noises i made every now and againmany of the comments already listed focus on the films solid britishness and consider it unlikely to do well on the other side of the atlantic whilst i wholeheartedly agree that the movie is firmly  completely  wonderfully british no casting of us actors to sweeten the stateside box office potential here i think theres just a possibility it could achieve a respectable level of interest and cult status with a discerning us crowd there are a few north americans who realise that british comedy isnt all benny hill are you being served or hugh grant who will seek out the strange and unusualjust so long as pegg et al are not seduced into trying to work in hollywood  that would be a very bad ideahats off to all involved in this hugely enjoyable movie  heres to a sequel  but only if the script is absolutely top notch dont do a matrix 23 on us for gods sake,black_comedy
the thing is spaced the tv series from which this is closely derived was perfect did i say that blimey a perfect series wow so this is not perfect because it occasionally looses its way trying to balance its heady blend of extreme horror genuine drama and big ol fashioned belly laughs thats a hard trick to pull off and shaun succeeds way more than it failsin the red corner shaun the magnificently louche simon pegg and his mate agonise over which of his precious lp collection to spin at the zombies heads while the undead loom over them very threatening not in the green corner a really heavy scene in the pub where shaun has to shoot his dear old mum in the head because shes copped a bite from a nasty the latter is much more effective than the former and i cant help but think director edgar wright is really hankering to make this a fullon drama he has all the toolsanyway see shaun because its really good much better than 28 days later,black_comedy
i was looking forward to seeing this movie for two reasons firstly i love horror movies and zombie movies are one of my favorites secondly i also loved spaced and the actors in this film had all been in previously very funny programs from the office to black books i think watching this film will show people exactly what british comedy is currently aboutthe film is great i wasnt disappointed there are loads of great moments and some really laugh out moments the 1st half of the film is very tight and jokes keep coming my only problem with the film is like most british comedies the second half becomes darker and not as fun i still enjoyed it though and cant wait for the dvd releasei give it a double adam b thumbs up go see it if your in a good mood it will be great if your in a bad mood itll cheer you upps i prefer this to dawn of the dead as it was closer to home for me as me and my mates have always said if the world was taken over by zombies we would definitely hole up in our local drinking havena thang ya,black_comedy
this film had me  my friends in stitches from begining to end it was also great to see a few fimiliar faces in it too like reece shearsmith from the league of gentleman matt lucas from little britain martin freeman from the office  hardware kenny from hardware  dylan moran from black books it was acted brilliantly  the comic timing was excellent one of the funniest moments was were shaun tried to jump over the fence  it collapsed on him  also were thim  ed were throwing the vinyl records at the two zombies in their backyard  they were arguing at which ones to throw so great it can be gross at times but it is easily balanced out with humour  the part where shaun has to shoot is mum is very dark  upsetting but overall this film was brilliant  id recommend it to anyone,black_comedy
very very funny one of the best comedy films for a long while maybe a bit too british in some parts for the us ie the corner shop the drinking  pub culture but well worth the trip to see it army of darkness is a direct comparison which was very clever but made me cry with laughter 9 out of 10 the zombie acting class scene is priceless another british film with a large number of actors from the office to all those in the uk who knock new british comedy films this a gem and it will make money therefore no problem with the lottery funding as per the sex lives of the potato men,black_comedy
i was very lucky to be present at a staff preview and i can whole heartedly say this is one of the best films i have seen this yearit is just so british in its dealing with zombees what other nationality would consider either going the pub to escape them or having a nice cup of tea  only we could manage to have a six months later and only have the whole occurance happening in one city in america it always spreads and it is assumed that the world has been taken overonly we brits could manage to walk to the newsagents past numerous undead and dead alike and not spot that there is something seriously amiss  the comic timing of the tv channel changing made this even more evidentalso the music timing is spot on i have a whole new appreciation for queen  the white lines moment is something not to be missedi am planning to go see it again as i feel this is one of those bonus films that each time you watch it you pick out extra thingsi look forward to any sequels that may be in the future,black_comedy
starring and cowritten by simon pegg of spaced fame aims for pure brit comedy whilst still showing great respect to george romeros classic trilogywhilst the plot remains very simple basic zombies take over the world type stuff the script is injected with fantastically humorous scenes that had me crying with laughteralthough the film takes a darker twist in the final third you still laugh out loud at the oneliners and the comic performance of pegg is absolutely spot on horror fans will be satisfied with some quality makeup and special effects for the zombies that are genuinely scarylook out for the scene which contains several cameos for actors from several british tv comedy seriesgreat film 910,black_comedy
after having back to back spaced and big train allnighters the thought of spaced series 3 was the only thing that kept me going until this golden mcnugget come along for all worshippers of simon pegg and nick frost this is an extended version of his unique brilliant humourif you have you seen this movie and didnt like it youve got something wrong with youif you havent seen this movie youve got something wrong with youif you have seen it liked it and then not gone and seen it again youve got something wrong with youthis is quite clearly the film of 2004,black_comedy
first let me say that this is probably the first ever splatter movie that im about to give a rave review some are well crafted but i find it hard to enjoy the gore thats mandatory in most of them when i saw the trailer for i instantly envisioned an english version of scary movie and decided to never see it but it was the only movie showing in my local theatre so i decided to give it a go you only live twice after allto see a movie with expectations lower than a david lynch dwarf can be really fantastic as in this case what unfolded in front of my eyes was actually something groundbreaking new take two cups of good english comedy add some tongueincheek gore put some drama with a bit of romance into the mix and you get all these genres put into one movie could easily create a huge mess but this is certainly not the case here so what makes this movie stand out comparing it to similar outings like scream and scary movie well its simply much braver scream eventually was too similar to the movies it made fun of while all the scary movies go for cheap jokes that weve all heard before on the other hand has lots of intelligent humour that will please most audiencessimon pegg is totally convincing in the lead but nick frost gets most of the laughs as his slacker friend ed kate ashfield and dylan moran also deserve praise for their roles the only reason i dont give a ten is because it can be hard to take the dramatic moments seriously between all funny moments go and see it if you want to see a zombie movie that gives you a good time instead of nightmaresverdict 910,black_comedy

quite simply the best british film ever made and one of the finest zombie movies to date  george romero eat your heart out literallyflawless direction and editing excellent special effects and a script that makes you titter right till the endit doesnt get any better than thisfunnier than dog soldiers scarier than the terrible 28 days laterand because its british made  devoid of the stupidity that haunts the majority of hollywood horrors wrong turn cabin fever jeepers creepers etc etcshaun youve got red on you,black_comedy
look lets be honest this is not the best film ever made its not even that scarey although nicely dark in places but is it funny it is entertaining and it is probably the most british film youll see in the cinema this year not the fake film producer england youll see elsewhere 29 days later felt too much like drama school production to me  and as for love actually  nice formula  but not really true british  more upper middle class rose tinted britishone thing it did make me realise that although i discovered black books i have somehow over looked spaced little britain the office the league of gentleman and now this film just go to prove how great british comedy isim hoping  this feel can be injected into the new hitch hikers film so far the cast list bodes well and has at least two people who appeared in shaun martin freeman  authur and bill naughty  slatybartfast,black_comedy
some laughsnothing hilariouscertainly didnt hear any of the other 10 people in the audience that wasted their tuesday night along with me rolling about in the aislesfilm totally dies after about 45 minutesthe acting gets really ropey after this point tooas does the dialoguei think they ran out of stuff to do to be honestoverall a bit rubbish reallydont see what all the fuss is about,black_comedy
some may dissmiss this because it looks a bit like a tv program some may not get the humour some will be dissapointed it lacks explosions and car chasesthose people are shallow fools the people that watch everything hollywood spews out then rushs out to buy the ea game of itthis is the eternal darkness of horror the obscure gamefilm that is so fresh and new that most people skip right over it it will quickly become a cult though zombies are scary in this they are dumb slow and can be killed easily yet they are scary far more scary then the runnning jumping leaping ones from 28 days later and far scarier then dawn of the dead this incidently is more close to the original filmthis is true horror and true comady strangly they mix perfectly dont expect scary moviecompletely unlike that movie this is both funny and scary the humour is very uniquenot slap stick and not gagbased its just funny situationsif you care about original films or you just want to see a proper horror film watch this,black_comedy

this film is a geek boys wet dream it is a pleasant and refreshing surprise that a film about zombies and also a british film is so fresh and vibrant and so entertaining spaced creative duo simon pegg and edgar wright are the writers here and wright is the director their obviously geekish love of film is evident in the superbly entertaining spaced and in this film as well simon pegg leads a superb cast of comic talent and plays the part of loser shaun to perfection the film is an obvious homage to dawn of the dead and follows almost the same pattern one morning the world is suddenly crawling with the undead and to ingenious comical effect the intellectually challenged shaun and his best mate equal in the stupid loser stakes ed dont realise this for ages the performances of both pegg and nick frost as ed are superb the dialogue in the film is fantastic there are constant laughs throughout this and some real big belly laughs too kate ashfield is also good as shauns long suffering girlfriend there is also great suport from lucy davis and a superb jessica stevenson im a little disappointed stevenson a lead in spaced is relegated to a cameo herethe film is superb as a comedy but what marks this down as instant cult classic is the fact that the dramatic sides and the horror elements also work great there are some genuine jumps and scares and wright manages to create real tension i have to safely say as well the soundtrack is one of the best ever this is overall a great film for buffs and general movie goers alike this is perhaps the film of the year so far alongside school of rock ,black_comedy
wow  what a treat this film ishad a quick squizz on here to see what others thought of the film  having seen a couple of adverts and watched a couple of episodes of spaced in the past it really did appeal  simon pegg is an amazingly talented guy  so simon if youre reading this well done mate went along to see it yesterday and i have to say its the only film ive felt compelled to commend on any website ever  comedy and plenty of it romance tragedy horror action this film has it all  some great jumpy bits toosorry to the guy sat in front of me he spilled his supersized coke all over himself when i kicked the back of his chair in frighti had tears rolling down my face through twothirds of the film  its so funny i could hardly breathe at some pointsim not one to ramble on and on but if youre open minded like the kind of alan partridgespaced humour and want to spend the best 550 this year go watch  you wont be disappointed,black_comedy
this is a more than mildly entertaining film which will make you laugh out loud there are little problems with it but its still a mustsee film the gore is amusingly done and the dialogue is first rate the actors are all from our fine british comedies and come together in a superb ensemble cast the film is essentially british and so lacks that american fast pace but makes up for it with quirky originality and odd moments the key joke is that britain would be very similar if everyone were zombies and the film plays on the great wartime pragmatism of the nation the last scene is utterly brilliant and is a great relief after all the obvious plot turns towards the end play out as you might expect any zombie film to just as we did with 28 days later we show that zombie films are best when british,black_comedy
i saw this movie last saturday with some good mates and what can i say with 4 minutes were pssing ourselves laughing not literally the comedy in this film is so varied on liners gore humor crazy random things piss takes on so many aspects of life and quite subtly zombie movies themselves all make hilarious appearences all of which are impeccably timed theres not one joke that i noticed that falls flat on its face  it just doenst happen this is definatly one to buy and though some of the jokes may be foudn to be disturbing by some people this in no way diminisheds the sheer genius of the writing in such a rish and varied film how can one joke lower its tone thanks go out to the writer producers actors and crew for giving us this masterpiece of a rom zom com,black_comedy
as a big fan of simon pegg and all of his spaced cronies i was so looking forward to seeing this film and went along on the day of release it didnt disappoint in fact it was so good i went again the following day everything  every single thing  about this film is fantastic the script the direction the acting the jokesthere is nothing wrong with this movie at all nick frost as ed is his usual brilliant slovenly self and its brilliant seeing jessica stevenson spaceds daisy pop up as yvonne she may only be in three scenes but shes great as are all her friends i could throw all the superlatives in the world at this movie none of which would do it justice brilliant on every level this really is a mustsee film if this doesnt win a stack of awards ill be at a loss excellent,black_comedy

let me first preempt this review with a little background i love zombie movies admittedly its a subgenre that is overpopulated and stories are recycled time and time over but the romero living dead trilogy is brilliant particularly dawn of the dead the recent dotd remake was pretty good and 28 days later is one of my favourite recent movies probably my favourite british movie ever made which leads me to my second point i am not a fan of british comedy films four weddings ill allow is actually very good mostly withnail and i is classic but the rest are fairly samey and safe without much of the fire and wit that british tv comedy seems to do very well at the momentas a former student i must confess a guilty love of spaced im a film nut so anything with references to cult movies is preaching to the converted added to that simon pegg jessica stevenson et al are not only gifted comedic performers they are credible actors spaced was slightly different  the antifriends  and has a very specific appeal it is with joy and hope for the future that i can honestly say that is worthy of sitting next to all the above on a dvd shelfthe first 45 minutes zip past littered with cinematic references and techniques the smash cuts from requiem for a dream for example ticking all the boxes of not only the horrorzombie rampage genre but also the level of humour expected of these performers essentially if youve seen any of pegg davis moran etc in their other well known roles they are riffing on those personas under different names once the situation has been established and the plan formulated the gags slow down a bit to ahem flesh out the plot and fulfill the cliches inherent to the setupits here that the film may lose some of its fans as it really becomes less of a comedy and more of a sidewiseglancing genre entry there are genuine shocks a sense of impending doom and strangely touching farewells not to mention a handsome helping of gore i actually found this to be quite refreshing it would have been easy to continue ripping away at the staples of the genre but not as memorable for one thing pegg firmly establishes himself as a leading man worthy of notice sure he has a schtick in terms of comedy but like say owen wilson it is appealing and funny also like owen wilson he can handle the dramatic chops when required he displays a nice versatility and a good range of emotion and you really pull for his character by the end the same goes for lucy davis who steps out slightly from the shadow of dawn to create someone quite believable and quietly humourous the camera really loves her here and she glowsa wonderfully almost unnoticeable aspect to the film that i never expected was half an hour from the end i had little idea of where the film would go and the more time ran out the more i was convinced noone would make it out in one piece how right was i well you should find out for yourselfsuffice to say that the film works wonderfully structurally technically comedically and dramatically all the time very aware of and respectful toward the genre it is lampooning it may slow down a bit in the last third but stay with it and you may find the idea of a followup not so dreadful personally id like to see a nonsequel with the same kind of characters placed in a different genre and story unrelated in any way to this one current rumours include children of the shaun and from dusk til shaun hawhawit is good news for the british film industry that this film is being so well received here and internationally as we might finally shrug off the full montyhugh grant romcom limitations inherent to uk successes in cinema to see films of the quality of the office reach big screens rather than small if you dig cult films alternative british comedy and something more worthy of rememberance than two weeks notice go see this film while its still around it will be everything you expect and nothing you expect how often do you say that about a british film,black_comedy
first things first if you have not seen this film yet go see it now it is one of the best films i have ever seenright now thats out of the way lets talk about running zombies yes people must agree with me they suck you can not beat the classic slow moving easy to push over and dodge zombies yet with all this problems they still get you and rip you in half i love it i think thats what let the remake of dawn of the dead down still it is a good film but the original is still an ass kickerwell thats all i can say shaun vs dawn close battle but shaun is the kingps now i really know how to play darts ,black_comedy
the british film industry has been crying out for a decent movie for ages  curtis is past it the office should never be on the big screen so where on earth are our good movies going to come fromwell i would cite this movie as the beginning of the a new era of british film  the one where were original and do action as well most british films recently have shied away from any action at all above a kind of gangland torture cliche that seems to crop up every five minutes there is so much about that excels the comedy is top notch especially if you like shaun feel youre going nowhere the zombies are well made up the only problem with the original dawn of the dead was their stupid green make up and the acting superbmost importantly though the actual violence is done so well its almost unbelievable this is a british scripted and directed movie obviously theres not a lot of pitched gun battles but its very refreshing to see a film be this daring this well also i think its great to see a film so british in nature not cod cockney gangster rubbish or anything just genuinely lazy britishif the industry is brave enough this along with the slightly less excellent though very good dog soldiers represents a new wave of british horror as for the director himself id like him to remember how multiple award winning director peter jackson started out a low budget horror comedy flick called bad taste and then braindead maybe well be seeing a lot more of him in the future i hope sofinally talking to people about this movie ive realised that many people wanted it to be funny all the way through and didnt like the darkness of the last 45 minutes i disagree wholeheartedly a horror spoof with zombies having blunt false teeth or whatever would be on a par with total vacuous tripe like dracula dead and loving it a movie like this needs its dark heart to be more than a silly mel brooks film i would say that we should view this film as a horror film with added comedy not a comedy film with zombies inin short and i know i go on forever this is the best british film for ten years american money notwithstanding go see it as part of your patriotic duty at least you wont be disappointedremember its not what shaun did its that he did anything at all thats importantps it is possible to see this film as a allegorical tale of a man having to grow up and say goodbye to the trappings of childhood mum best freind etc to grow up and commit to the woman he loves but why bother analysing it when its this much fun,black_comedy
having been a huge huge fan of spaced and in particular simon pegg i was looking forward to this film more than any other in a long long timei was not in the least bit disappointedspaced is known for its ironic view on modern life and fast paced cutting dialogue if you are a fan of spaced you will love the in jokes  ps2 playing calling each other babe shaun and eds relationship etcthere was not one person in the cinema not laughing out loud at all the right times and im sure i was not the only one welling up towards the endi dont want to spoil it for anyone so i wont give it away but all i will say is that it is so brilliantly exciting not in the least bit predictable in plot and you really do not have a clue how it will end what i wouldnt give for more films like thisif you dont enjoy this film you have a real problem and should see someone about it anyone that cannot give a reason that isnt pretentious in anyway for not loving it deserves nothing but miseryshould win every award possible  best film direction sound edititng best supporting actor and best actor for simon pegg he has just joined the big boys,black_comedy
it is a very british film and a clear example of the difference between ourselves and the americans when the zombies attack the americans go to a shopping mall which to be fair is quite sensible  plenty of supplies and remote location etc when the zombies attack england we go to the pub which is a default setting for the british  apocalypse  just time for a quick pint then there are many scenes that are wonderful but to describe any of them might spoil them see this film if you have ever watched a zombie film see this film,black_comedy
this is a great rom zom com that i really didnt want to see but am sooo glad i did as its very funny  a general p take of all zombie films done to a high standardglad to see that everyone was in it  even for a small cameo  daisy from spaced fran from black books tim from the office matt lucas and reece from league of gentlemani highly reccomend you watch this film but you must be in the right frame of mind for a bit of comedy and blood and guts toowatch it  with a lots of friends and beerlets hope simon pegg and the crew make many more,black_comedy
after the debacle that was sex lives of the potato men the accolade of being heralded as the saviours of british comedy may very well have been cheapened nevertheless in writeractor simon pegg and director edgar wright succeed in resurrecting the idea that originality and brilliance can still be found on our shores described as a romzomcom romantic zombie comedy the team behind channel four sitcom spaced tell the story of the ambitionstarved and freshlydumped shaun pegg shaun in his misery and inebriation at first fails to notice that the dead are coming back to life but when he and his lazy best friend are attacked he springs into action to save his ex her friends and his mum far from being a spoof of zombie films this is actually a much more loving and faithful recreation of the genre than the recent remake of dawn of the dead pegg and wright clearly worship the movies they continually reference and the humour arises from the characters realistic reactions to what is going on around them the girly scream of ooh hes got an arm off being a prime example when our hero encounters one the first undead from the woeful attempts to destroy the zombies with a record collection pool cues and empty beer cans the whole thing is an honest and hilarious appreciation of how an ordinary man would deal with the apocalypse the transition from comedy to a much darker and horrific second half is also handled well and keep an eye out for the ceaseless number of cameos the comedy is perhaps a little too narrow for a global audience but it works absolutely superbly on home soil,black_comedy
this film is a welcomed relief after having to sit through the woeful sex lives of the potato men i can honestly say that this is what british comedy is all about the characterisation is spoton the eclectic mix of characters mixes so well the leadership skills in shaun manifesting themselves even though he appears to be so unmotivated and complacent really makes him seem like he is some sort of hero shauns best friend ed really does steal the show though his constant stream of hilarious one liners is really what turns the film from being funny to bloody hilarious i defy anyone to not cry with laughter when he requests a cornettothis is what the british film industry has been crying out for for too long have many films been hyped as british comedies that will crack the american market only to end up flat on their backside whereas sex lives of the potato men was a one trick pony with its constant sexual references and love actually was merely nauseatingly pleasant sotd contains so many different funny scenes and moments played out to their full comic potential by a cast containing some of british comedys rising stars this really is a british film to be proud of,black_comedy
one of the best films iv seen this year and iv seen alot much better than dawn of the dead 2004slow starter but soon get your attention with loads of laughs some tears and some nasty nasty gutwrenching zombie actionin terms of sfx almost as good as dawn of the dead also stays true to the original zombie form there arent any zombies running or jumping across rooms to rip out jugularsfunniest and best zombie movie ending everbtw if anyone says this is the best romzomcom theyve ever seen im goin to make a zombie out of their asses,black_comedy
this film was the best film i have ever seen in the cinema that has been made in the uk it is easily the best british made comedy since withnail and i and should immediately find its way into everyones dvd collection upon its dvd release if you found even one episode of spaced remotely funny you need to see this film these guys are geniuses or geniai and successfully make a zombie romantic comedy that crosses all boundries and should appeal to a bizarre but wide audience from those who enjoyed bridget jones diary to those who love braindead and dawn of the dead original so a menagerie of a cinema going experience is to be had by allend of the day you gotta see this film worth stealing a car for a jag perhaps,black_comedy
is the best british comedy to be released in years paying respect to zombie films and the sitcom spacedbritish tv comedy show both zombie and spaced fans will love this film to bits with a huge cast of british actors from a range of comedy sitcoms such as spaced black books the officeect for british viewers spotting actors you recognize is not hard to do plus the fact that it is not laughs all the way with sad bits such as the death of shauns mum and that it gives a look at the way britain maybe heading everyone going to the pub every night playing with mobile phones all the timeect becomes even better 810,black_comedy
in light of the recent release of the remake or re imagining of dawn of the dead its hard not to make comparisons between these two films that both owe so much to george romeros seminal worksbut lets not just for now and take shaun as a film in its own rightis it well shot yes  for me being english myself the look of the film its very realistic slightly grainy look and superb colour balance brought the reality of zombie holocaust home to me much more than any mall in pittsburgh or nuclear bunker in florida ever could these are my streets my corner shops and my local pub there camera is intelligently used and follows the action as well as the more intimate scenes for those who have seen spaced there will be some familiar filmic techniques used here note used not over usedis it funny yes absolutely hilarious you cant fail to be awed by the second walk to the corner shop or the background action in the first half of the movie its a brilliant blend of black humour physical comedy and pathos that impresses like nothing has since well spaced really its sharp and dry yet it treats the matter of survival very respectfully the drama and tension are maintained throughout this is not scary movie this is clever mature writing from some of the best talent in england todayis it romeroie okay that not really a word but how does it hold up to the original films you ask very well indeed pegg has described the film as a love letter to george romero and so it is we have our beloved shuffling zombies back again we have charecterful dead we have many fantastic references to the early films i wont spoil anything by listing them here but any fan will have a great time in the pub after comparing notes on the referencesso that thing you talked about at first the other dead film how does it hold up well shaun is clearly a superior film to the remake of dawn it does all the things that the original dawn did that the remake failed to do it is character driven these people are recognisable as our mates we are involved with their lives and we are made to care so when the chomping jaws do come we are scared for the people in the film its great ensemble work worth believable relationships and reactionsthere is more care given to developing relationships than a feeble 3 minute time is passing montage ala dawn 2004 there are no disposable un realised characters ala dawn 2004 even the people who never speak and are hardly seen alive at all for those whove seen it think cowboy boots are more authentic than meike phiffers whole character as good an actor as he isokay i didnt intend when i sat down to write this to sound like a gushing fanboy but to any romero fan spaced fan or basically breathing human with a sense of humour this film is that good plus its british so i suppose this is my love letter to simon pegg et al you made a fans film with humour and integrity good on you go see it now,black_comedy
this is without doubt the second best film i have seen all year the first being the passion of the christ being a fan of the first dawn of the dead i went to see the new remake how they managed with all that money to make a balls up i dont know had about a 10th of what they had to spend on that piece of crap not only that thoe shaun being the first rom com zom made was well worth the 520 it cost me to see it that being about 12us and well worth it to go again my fav bit of the film had to have been the beating with pool cues to dont stop me now by queen the crowd were ping them selfs watching it and the debate that will last the dawn no pun intended of time can dogs look up  now they can if they move there head but if they keep there faces front i dont think they can just move there eye balls to look up like we canor can they  simon pegg to any one who saw spaced you know is great and nick frost with out doubt made this film with out them to bouncing off one and other it wouldnt have worked i also enjoyed the cameos of so many well known stars its a shame billbo baily couldnt have been one of them thoe and the 100s of in jokes were great and with out failing to say about the fx that they had in the new dawn of the dead didint have a patch on the fx they had in this low budget they realy did go back to the classic way of doing it the way romero did it in this will become one of the must own dvds for any fan of the dead films or comedy or romance truley a rom com zom,black_comedy
i suspect that youd have to be a spaced afficionado or at least be into the same things that simon pegg et al are into to really get the most out of this movie but it would still be great fun even if youve never heard of spaced  in fact only those without a sense of humour or knowledge of pop culture would be advised to stay awaythe only bit that made me wince slightly due to cheesiness was towards the end wont say what happens as it would spoil the plot but other than that it was pitch black comedy and great one liners from beginning to endrecommended unless you have a phobia of zombies,black_comedy
like the indians i had my reservations about this film but after watching it i would recommend it to anybody who1 likes spaced 2 likes zombie movies 3 likes a laugh 4 has a pulsehonestly just go and see it im not saying its the best film in the world and i dont think it will be well received outside the uk but if you think you may fit one of the above categories give it a go  it does exactly what it says on the tin,black_comedy
first of all the only reason i went to watch this film was because a couple of my friends recommended it heartily thats a sign of a great film advertisement via word of mouth suffice to say its one of the best zombiehorror films in recent memoryshaun simon pegg of spaced fame in superb form is a salesperson who lives with his two mates one ed a dole hungrylazy slob the other pete an old student friend who has a steady job through the film shaun has to come to terms with responsibility and maturity ranging from relationships with his girlfriend accepting his stepfather as a parent and person and getting a hold of his nonexistent social life all he does is spend his entire time either with ed in the winchester his local or play playstation games again with ed in fact his deadend 9 to 5 job routine resembles one that of a zombie we see when he wakes up the camera pan up from his lumbering feet to his zombielike yawning or should that be groaning that he has to do this every day this can be seen in others throughout the film everyone is in sync doing more or less the same things at the same time probably for as long as they can remember theyve programmed themselves to do the every day ritual of waking up and heading of to work to an extent that we can see the films social commentary shining through everyone more or less in the real world is a zombie thats the first half of the film the second half is where we see the actual zombies especially and surprisingly for a 15 rated film plenty of stomach churning gore spoiler of sorts especially when david is ripped to pieces ill round things of by saying that this is a film which manages to add plenty of laughter romance social commentary the issues of responsibility added with dealing with growing up and by mixing it with the backdrop of a zombie film simon pegg and edgar wright have created a gem of a masterpiece highly recommended,black_comedy
whilst this movie contains many of the cast of spaced including a nicely madeup tyres as a pub zombie dont expect this to be spaced  the zombiefilled feature length episode  aside from a few subtle nods here and there the film references which spaced loved to use are intentionally absent and the only real parody is in the titlehowever as a film it stands on its own two feet extremely well  the first two thirds of the film is essentially shaun simon pegg being dumped by his girlfriend and being totally oblivious to the massing zombie hordes around him whilst the last third is spent fending off the wretched undead  the comedy also pretty much lies in the former part as well once the zombies really get attacking the laughs die out in favour of action which was somewhat disappointing  however this said the action really revs up from the moment shaun picks up his cricket bat leading to a lot of pretty satisfying zombie despatchingas it happens im one of the shadows outside the pub when theyre sat in there wondering what to do next which was a good laugh  from what we were told itll be worth your while getting the dvd when it comes outanyway go watch and enjoy youll be glad you did,black_comedy
to be quite honest i was really expecting to be disappointed with thisthe word of mouth was just too good15 certificate  oh no watered down fxtheyll never be able to keep up that spaced feel for a full two hourshow wrong i wascompared to the recent dawn of the dead remake which flew straight into the action in a matter of minutes there was quite a wait for any undead action with actual characters being developed with actual back stories  by the time there was anything even close to danger you actually felt that you knew them and i would have been quite happy to watch a whole movie of the characters alone  they were painted in such a way that you sympathised with them and their deadend liveswhen the zombie elements start to creep in there are many very funny scenes of the main characters complete obliviousness to the escalating situation there is one particularly impressive tracking shot of simon pegg making his way to the corner shop and back for a drink to cure his hangover the exact same journey he made the day before  but this time with a slightly different backdrop  wonderful both cinematically and humourouslythroughout this film there is a well balanced mix of sadness and scares as well as the laughs  its certainly no spoof and im sure could work as a fullblown zombie flick with minimal changes  the effects are good and quite graphic at points but in a typically zombie cartoon fashion  the performances are good too especially the friendship between pegg and nick frost though im not quite sure how much acting would have been needed herefor fans of spaced the office and other british comedies you could spend the whole film spotting cameosall in all this exceeded my expectations significantly  its just such well made good natured witty infectious fun and everyones obvious love for the material is infectious  my only worry was for the lack of an audience  i saw it on the opening friday night expecting a full house  the turnout was quite embarrassing  perhaps its too close on the heels of the dawn remake  maybe the marketings only reached those who didnt need it spaced  horror fans  this is a shame as even my wife a complete horror movie hater and never seen spaced said it was her favourite film in a long timei just hope word of mouth gets this film all it deserves  why  cos i want to see from dusk til shaun and i want it now,black_comedy
is the best british horror movie in a long time and the funniest film i have seen in years it starts off with its message clear and bold  when you spend every day of your life doing the same mundane thing are you really livingshaun lives with his mate ed a complete waste of space his job is boring he spends every night in his local much to the despair of his girlfriend who wants a little bit more from life his life is going nowhere and he is on the verge of losing everything then zombies start appearingthis film could have been so bad  a romzomcom but through the spoton acting and brilliant sharp direction by edgar wright it has a vivacity that never lets up i have never watched a film before with so many laughoutloud moments the cast made of the cream of modern british comedy really breathe life into their characters simon pegg as shaun shows our hero as just like the rest of us but is excellent in a role that goes through a rollercoaster of emotions special mention must be given for bill nighys short but poignant role which provides a turning point for our intrepid survivors i was worried if the film would stretch to feature length given the tv pedigree of the cast and crew but the time flew by and i was especially pleased with an ending which was true to the spirit and humour of the rest of the film go see this film it is worth it id like to say my wife enjoyed it as well  it is the first film where she has laughed while hiding her eyes in my armpit,black_comedy
saw this film last night and was very impressed as a fan of spaced but not of zombie flicks i was unsure how much i warm to the characters but they were almost all excellent nick frost as the dropout flatmate was superb demonstrating once again that he has a bit more range than you might expect simon pegg was also excellent although it would be easier for us to stop thinking of him as tim bisley if he stopped looking exactly like tim bisley out of all the other solid performances lucy davis and dylan moran also shone however i too am concerned that the almost overnight success of this film may scupper the promised series 3 of spaced,black_comedy
warning this review will probably contain spoilers i havent decided yetokay let me first start off by clearing up a common misconception  is not a direct spoof of dawn of the dead instead it is a spoof of zombie movies in generaloh and its probably the funniest movie so far this year and one of the goriestin case you havent read any of the fiftyorso other comments about the film on this site heres the plotshaun is living in a rundown flat with an excollege pal and his slobbish best friend  he has a mundane job and a generally boring life  his idea of a romantic night out involves going down the local pub the winchester with his girlfriend liz and mates  naturally liz disagrees with this and dumps him  shaun resolves to get her back and prove how much he loves her but there is a slight complication in that the entire city of london seems to have suddenly been overrun by the walking deadalthough it sounds more than a little mushy there is no doubt that this is a horror film  violent gory and briefly genuinely scary but first and foremost it is a comedy  genre fans will have a field day spotting all the references to classic zombie films shauns mum is called barbera and they phone her to tell her theyre coming to get her overall id say that shaun is definitely the funnest film i have seen for quite a while and that cant be a bad thing,black_comedy
i must admit i was nervous about seeing this film  i am a massive fan of spaced and thought the writing and direction of those shows were brilliant however quite a lot of writers and directors have proven that the transition from the small to the big screen just doesnt work and i so wanted this film not to disappoint and boy it did not let me down at all this is one genuinely funny and very creepy movie  when people likened it to the an american werewolf in london it was justified the laughs come quick thick and fast  and so does the gore  simon pegg  is brilliant as sean portraying a man who is for all intents and purposes a zombie as the film opens shauns drifting through life stuck in a dead end job coasting through life with his loser friend ed nick frost putting in a brilliant performance by his side and stuck in the same routine which is putting his relationship in jeopardy  shauns drifting through life so much he doesnt even notice the first signs of the zombie epidemic occurring about him and only when he is confronted with this situation does he finally take hold of his life and spring into action to save his friends his girl and of course his mum this is a brilliantly observered comedy the characters and their relationships with each other feel so genuine and because of this you really end up caring what happens to everyone in this film something that so rarely happens in any film let alone a horror movie  and the film which zips along at quite a pace has some very genuinely funny scary and emotional scenes in it before you worry about the emotional scenes slowing the movie down it should be pointed out that excellent editing means that just as it might be all getting a bit too serious a gag or a scare jumps out of nowhere and youre off again  it gets to the point where youre not sure whats going to happen next emotionally speaking and quite literally at this point all bets are off the script is taut sharp intelligent and very very funny  there is more going on onscreen that youll never catch every joke or every reference in a single viewing  the acting is excellent and the zombies are genuinely creepy all in all this is a fantastic flick and i urge everyone to give it a viewing,black_comedy
absolutely first rateit lives up to all the previews and beyond  most reviews slated the end slipping into blood and gore but it was done well and with a pointi have never seen spaced so came to this without preconceptions and was not disappointedthe interaction between the characters is superb the dialogue excellent and generally a good well put together filmall the characters are well cast and i think most modern british comedy series had at least one of their cast in a cameowas richard e grant one of the zombies in the pub  he is not creditedwhy cant all british comedies be this good,black_comedy
after seeing dawn of the dead and being a bit depressed with it and disappointedi had a feeling this would be the perfect antidote  i was rightfrom the very first this movie was hilarious  in the character of shaun was something everyone in the cinema identified with  he was a brilliant hero rising to the challenge when he finally realized that zombies had in fact taken over which took a whilebut this was more than a comedy  it was a sharply observed statement on how we live or to be precise dont live our lives today  it was a warning in a way to value what we have or have the potential to achieve before its too late  or maybe im reading into it more than was intended and it was just absolutely brilliant comedy,black_comedy
the bbc has shown the original night and dawn of the dead over the weeks since dawns remake was released at the end of march 04 so any fans can compare all four films if theyve seen them and in my case read the 1978 dawn of the dead novel in that context coming at the end of three serious zombie flicks in a fortnight shaun is just what i needed but the producers obviously aimed for a release date around that of dawns remake the characters are developed far enough for you to miss them if they bite the dust and even if they conflict with shaun  co which didnt happen with romeros series as he preferred the people not knowing each other thrown together angle with night and day of the dead in night nobody would have had a publicly acknowledged black friend in late 60s deep southern us and in original dawn its two pairs of characters who know each other through worki dont do spoilers but i will say that the running theme from romeros flicks of what happens when the people close to you become victims is also explored in this film with much more immediate honesty and doesnt let the viewer laugh off a pessimistic moment in fact once they reach somewhere they think theyre safe the laughs are put on hold for the proper horror to really get a grip its an excellent mix of horror and comedy and certainly the most unique way ive seen of making romcom fodder interesting to a male audience as in 99 of the usual mush they always end up together with a lot less work zombie fans need to listen out for the music at the start and on the credits but also the dialogue and check out the name of shauns workplacei enjoyed it but will probably buy the dvd rather than watch it again on the big screen well have to see if going for the laughs allows it to beat 28 days 45million gross in america horror fans have had to put up with much worse enforced attempts at comedy with gore witness the freddy series its not laugh out loud funny all the way through but that wasnt the intention its well worth watching in my opinionthe only criticism i couldnt refute was the rippingoff of sam raimis chainedtogether camera zoom effects however people not into films wont care about that see it,black_comedy
if there was any doubt that the spaced crew were not sheer genius then this film quashes that like a bullet in the head this is hilarious and one of the best examples of british comedic nuance ive seen in a long timeits just a pretty usual scenario 30 something shaun simon pegg needs to do something other than veg out in the pub if hes to keep the girl kate ashfield luckily or not the walking dead barely recognisable from the pub regulars or the shelf stackers descend upon his worldwhat follows is a race against time for shaun along with the brilliant nick frost as ed to carry out the big plan in order to save himself and his loved onespegg has the small details of londoners down to such a t that sometimes i was laughing at myself women will love it the guys will love it and zombies will definitely not be offendedthis film is hackney on an early sunday morning all the important things are here your local pub your local drug dealer your regular cuppa tea and ya mamfinally something to erase the sad naval gazing drivel of 28 days laterclassic,black_comedy
anyone going to see expecting an all out spoof had better think again although the film makes some reference to dawn of the dead  28 days later this film is unique although the film is funny even during the most poignant of scenes it does get extremely heavy and maybe even a bit tearful though this is dealt with extremely well pegg showing that hes not just a comedian but a superb actor too i give two thumbs up i will definately be buying this when it comes out,black_comedy
in fact its the most british film ive seen in long long time more british than any of richard curtis offerings more british than even harry potter the sense of place is strong in possibly that could be an alienating feature but in truth i loved it well done to all concernedits also very funny in a way that relies a lot on delivery and context its not quoteable in that respect the humours difficult to relate to people who werent there but its very funny on the screen youll just have to trust those of us who have seen itdespite that it gets quite dark towards the end and there are one or two lumpinthethroat moments to go alongside the many edgeoftheseat moments this is very definitely a spoof but it kind of works quite well as a zombie film in its own right here and therealso i loved seeing jessica stevenson pop up here and there any chance of a jesscentred sequel,black_comedy
anyone who saw the popular but still underrated channel 4 sitcom spaced will know that it was something special a few years on and the team from spaced have produced their movie and its not a dissappointment by any meansit isnt spaced the movie as some people might think none of the characters from spaced make an appearance there are a few references to the series but they are littered through the movie in a subtle waysimon pegg easily takes on the role of shaun a 29 year old who works at an electronics store in london his girlfriend is constantly nagging him about hanging around with his best mate ed nick frost who is essentially living a student lifestyle without being a student shauns relationship problems are the least of his worries when the living dead begin an attack on his home what follows is a great mix of comedy horror and some really good actingthis is a film that was made with passion the zombies are shambling idiotic and slow just like the classic zombies from george romeros dead trilogy where the film truly excels is that it captures a portion of the british lifestyle shaun asks ed what he wants from the shop after a night of heavy drinking his response a cornetto this and the pub set up will have people in the audience saying hey thats my lifeis a movie that everyone should see if youve ever watched spaced and enjoyed it or if you are a fan of the zombie genre then get your ass to the cinema now this is the best british movie in years and it would be a crime to miss out on it,black_comedy
after watching i instantly decided that it has to be my favorite british romantic comedy zombie movie ever true there are not many other movies that fit into that particular subgenre but i enjoyed the film immensely all the same i disagree that this movie is just an extension of spaced although i am a big fan of the show what became apparent to me whilst watching shaun   is that writer and actor simon pegg and director edgar wright not only understand the timing of comedy but they understand cinema they have made an exceptionally funny film which is not so much a parody of the zombie movie but a loving homage to the zombie movie particularly the films of george a romeroshaun   contains all the conventions of the zombie movie along with some sidesplitting very british humour so diehard defenders of the zombie movie need not be offended has high production values for a british film great action sequences and dark humour which is not a million miles away from the likes of kill billlets hope the guys from spaced will be back on the big screen soon 810,black_comedy
i watched this movie last night and couldnt stop laughing i had anticipated a good attempt at a comedyhorror movie but its biting satire and thoroughly brilliant writing had me applauding laughing and curled over in pain with every gag and zombie movie homage the cannibal scene from zombie flesh eaters was there the tear apart from day of the dead was there spoilers alert who would not cry when shaun has to kill his mum or when ed is attacked or when the indian guy in the corner shop asks shaun if he wants beer at 830am sorry student flashbacki love this film i will return to cinema next week and enjoy it all over again then ill get the dvd when its released and enter it pride of place into my film top tenloved it,black_comedy
ive loved simon pegg for years ever since his early work with steve coogan and am very glad hes finally starring in his own film was exactly as i hoped it would be funny gory intelligent but stupid if that makes any sense to anyone and farcical without becoming overly sillythe acting talent was great my favourites being lucy davies dylan moran and of course pegg himself and it was great to see jessica stevenson popping up i genuinely jumped a couple of times and spoiler when dylan moran was literally taken to pieces i cringed big timeis a great film with everything going for it its hard for me to pinpoint anything thats really wrong with it to be honest although a couple of my friends thought some parts were just too serious for the surrounding material i disagreed i thought they handled the comedy with the tragedy and the premise of the story is initially a tragic one very well indeed pegg proving to be like many comics a decent comic actor after the purile trash that was sex lives of the potato men hopefully will be wiped from all our memories theres 5 quid and 90 minutes ill never see again has restored my faith in british cinema and as a mark of patriotism and respect for the film im rating it 10,black_comedy
this film is bloody brilliant a great british film and a perfect homage to romeros work as wellthe spaced gang got everything deadon right excuse the pun lets start with the zombie film checklist shall we 1 is it gory oh yes fantastically so the effects and makeup work is doubly phenomenal2 is it scary yes it is its definitely comedyhorror in both meanings of the term the tension builds more towards the end of the film by this point youve invested in the main characters enough that theres a heavy amount of dread that we may lose any of them and there are a number of wellearned jumps along the way3 does it have social commentary yep the original dawn is still tops at this i feel but shaun gets some nice satirical swipes in these aimed at the zombification of our society as a whole and if the dead did start walking around a city like london you might not notice it immediatelyi think those are the key elements that a good zombie flick needs and this film passes all of them with style but then of course it also has the added bonus of being a total scream in the haha sense its really insanely funny i havent laughed at the piccies as much in a long long time and its not like you just remember a few main funny bits which happens with some comedies shaun is continuously funny all the way through be it with some ace visual gag or the more smarter stuff im sure i missed some of its subtle material but ill try to spot it when i go see it again next weekim also going to try to spot more joke references to zombie films of the past and other nonzombie ones that are scattered throughout horror film aficionados are going to love playing this game there are references all over the shop some of them are shops in factthe cast is cool bananas take various actors out of all the best recent brit comedy shows add in bill nighy and this is what you end up with its unbeatable imho simon pegg takes the lead exceptionally well and yet still has the film stolen from him by nick frost as shauns best friend ed the character of ed is such a loser but the way nick frost plays him you just have to love the bloke kate ashfield dylan moran and lucy davis all do great jobs toowhat else can i write about the direction fantastic the music fantastic the ending oh lordy the ending is solid goldan absolute mustsee,black_comedy
do not miss this movie it not only features some of the finest comedy actors  actresses around it also features some neat direction and hilarious lines if you dont like zombie flicks dont worry they dont like the z word in this movie but if you do like zombie flicks then you need not worry either its full of them fans of uk show spaced will adore this and fans of comedy in general will be delighted to see a film that has got all sorts of laughs throughout also of note is the hip soundtrack and the numerous pop culture references again i repeat do not miss,black_comedy
 spoilers are inevitable where to begin the start seems like a good place the first shock of the night was after watching the trailers when the film certificate appeared scooby doo 2 monsters unleashed what the it turned out the cinema had mixed the reels up but that was one major shockafter moving down two screens and having to endure the orange mobile advert twice british cinemagoers will know what im talking about its the one with alan cumming in it the correct film finally started hoorah for the right film being shown anyway the start mostly prior to the films narrative beginning is a great satire of modern life  zombies or just stuck in a routinewhile the film isnt made around the shocks  other than the bathroom scene i cannot remember even jumping slightly at any other point  it stays true to the zombie genre the zombies are stupid and lurching and dont run unlike in the remake of the films seminamesake dawn of the dead 2004 the sfx and makeup teams really did a good job with the zombies and gore with it being some of the most realistic ive seen in a film that isnt strictly a horrorwhile i didnt get any of the spaced 1999 tvseries injokes  i watched that but dont remember much of it and nothing in particular  they almost all flow perfectly with the script for the ones that dont i just assume that i dont find them funny due to general ignorance there is also a beautiful scene in the pub when the jukebox just starts playing queens cant stop me now its on random is the excuse and the subsequent fight is perfectly choreographed complete with flashing lights its really not as bad as i make it sound herewhile some deep meaningful moments occur later in the film it is made up for in the final section after the rather convenient appearance from the army id tell you about it but that would ruin it even if you do like spoilers suffice to say that it is omglolrofll01lmao11 or hilarious for the internet users with brains american audiences will have to swap the name trisha for jerry springer but otherwise all is good i say go say this film if you have a brain that any zombie would die forps hoorah for british filmmaking finally i recognise the tv channels and news anchors that are starring,black_comedy
aptly billed as a romzomcom sotd satisfies all three genres  firstly it is romantic but thankfully without the blatent sentimentality common to many a modernday blockbuster  rather sotd is romantic in an everyday way  excepting the fact that a zombie outbreak isnt a common happenstance  but we all have a shaun or eddy on a couch near us  secondly there are zombiehorrortastic moments aplenty with a suspensebuilding soundtrack and cinematography that keep you on the edge of your seat and untelegraphed moments to keep you out of it  above all though its a comedy drawn from a plethora of influences a lively script and great performances which result in a laughoutloud thoroughly enjoyable treat  apart from all that its an excellent opportunity to prod the person next to you and exchange knowing glances of recognition at faces wellknown and wellloved on the small screen  enjoy,black_comedy
as comedy zombie films go and its not the hugest genre to be honest this is one of the best  its not in the same league as braindead but peter jacksons the king of comedy horror paradies so its not fair to compareshaun is a electronics salesman who finds himself in the position of needing to save his friends and family when london is overrun by zombiesthis doesnt have a go at horror films as much as actually pay a lot of respect to them and theres enough references there to keep the avid horror buff entertainedin dawn of the dead the mindless braindead zombies go to the mall  in they go down the pub  a take modern day life if ever this was onea rollicking good laugh throughout,black_comedy
an absolutely excellent film ive never seen spaced and didnt really think itd be my kind of humour but the trailer interested me not only the best british film ive seen in ages the best film ive seen in ages at last a homegrown film that isnt full of the sickening schmaltz of the likes of love actually or the ridiculous toff characters that no one can really relate to it is a film about real people acting like real people funny gripping and reaching amazing levels of emotional involvement the closing siege in the winchester is compelling and better than anything youll see in the hollywood pap that is supposedly betternot sure how it will travel beyond britain deserves to be a huge hit but the american market will no doubt overlook it or might not get it an excellent film it has inspired me to go and check out spaced and i hope there is more to come from this team if not a sequel a prequel about the characters daily lives would be of equal appeal although probably less dramatic,black_comedy
as with nearly all british movies this effort falls well short of hollywood standards a firsttime script shows itself up to being rather an amatuerish attempt brit movies are mostly created by people who have come fresh from tv without bothering to understand the medium lame quirky sitcom style dialogue dominates the first act theres a confusion as to what the writers are trying to achieve with some vague notions about character setup and developmenthowever i was prepared to forgive the weak opening after the 2nd act started well with two very funny moments everything seemed to be coming right and i was sitting back ready for a good hours laughter unfortunately me and the rest of the audience were to be dissapointed the comedy dried up pretty soon with us realising we were at a onegag event where the writers had no idea where to go with this storythe script fell into a muddle  is this sitcom farce romantic comedy horror dramabarely a snigger was to be had from the entire second half of the movieat one point our heros are beating a zombie to death in time to a queen track being played on the duke box maybe this got huge laughs in other showings but in my theatre there was a deathly silence as this scene went on and on and ona moment later i noticed people leavingthe end is pretty bad the writers just seem to have forgotten this is meant to be a comedy perhaps simon pegg decided to write himself some emotional scenes to look good on his showreel waste of time  he really aint that good an actorall in all this movie was a failure the fact it was located in crouch end where i grew up but is now inhabited by the media elite didnt endear it to me either they tried to make out crouch end is full of normal people the place is full of people who think theyre great movie makers but are really just average tv makers now if those crouch end zombies had been the bbcchannel 4 tv producers media lawyers wanna be script writers graphic designers pseudointellectuals now theres a zombie flick i wanna see,black_comedy
i was really looking forward to see thisand it was better than i ever thought it has some genuine belly laughs as well as a couple of chuckles the gore for all you gore hounds out there is very good especially when david is being pulled through the pub window and gets his guts ripped out that was rather gory i thoughits basically about a guy named shaun simon pegg and his failed life and who is so wrapped up in his own life he doesnt notice that the dead are rising i never really sore spaced although on the strength of this film i think i might go out and buy them                                         9 out of 10,black_comedy
great to see pegg gets to do a zombie film i remember reading a while back that dawn of the dead was one of his favouritesit has enough to please british audiences and fans of spaced will enjoy seeing a rehash of the tim and mike friendship the films essential cynical premise seems to be that living in britain is like living amongst zombies anyway it starts very promisingly and has some great key scenes like fighting off a pair of zombies using a record collection critically sorting and choosing which records once all the characters get together though the film starts to sag the humour thins out and the plot seems to give up going anywhere good intelligent dialogue that spaced fans might be expecting is replaced by characters yelling and swearing the films budget is understandably tight but i would have hoped that wright and pegg could have had more fun with the genre other than shaun and ed the rest of the characters have little opportunity for development with morans character  david being set up for predictable dispatch near the enda great first film perhaps,black_comedy
warning  the following review may be extremely biased based on my predisposition towards anything related in any way to thebestestthingontellyever aka spaced please bear this in mind before rushing out to see it if your over 40 dont like blood and guts and arent british then your probably not going to like itis released on friday described as a romcom or a romantic comedy with zombies sotd focuses on the life of shaun simon pegg an almost30something who fears responsibility and growing up so much so that his girlfriend of 3 years has had enough and dumps him leaving him to his life sharing a flat with his best mate ed nick frost a 30something with the mental age of a 10 year old to make matters worse he doesnt get on with his family and hes been stuck in the same deadend job since he was a studentdrowning his sorrows with yet another night in the pub across the road from their house shaun decided to sort his life out hes going to be a good son to his mother going to win his girl back and going to sort his life out one small problem though the living dead has decided to start walking the earth shaun enlists the help of ed and together they battle across london to rescue his mother and girl and pick up the crop of the current british sitcom elite on the waysotd is basically an extension of the spaced universe this means we get repeated jokes ed and shauns straightasapeg heterosexual man love just like tim and mikes injokes jessica stevenson aka spaceds daisy popping up saying im glad one of us made it and the obvious running themes not wanting to face up to responsibility trying to cling on to your youth make what you will of the fact that the zombies may be representative of that responsibility take on that responsibility and you become another drone wheeling that trolley through asda on a sunday afternoon wondering what happened to your lifeits also very british the yanks just might not get it theres lots of references to british media news t4 music and british institutions the pub pork scratchings popping down the corner shop for a pint of milk then theres all the little spaced bits  references to clubbing drugs and dance music one of my favourite lines is its not hiphop its electrolastly a word on the certification the actual film cert is a 15 how it managed this i have absolutely no idea because its even more violent than the latest dawn of the dead remake which received an 18 it perhaps managed to scrape past because its a comedy the violence however is not comedic its extremely gory and respect to the sfx guys extremely believableanyway despite the violence if you love spaced andor you love zombie films andor you love romantic comedies go see it support these guys because im sure if you will theyll pay us back with more gems like shaun,black_comedy
saw the film last night at a special preview in london and it was completely fantastic  very funny but also creepy in all the right places  the zombies themselves are extremely realistic did i say realistic but this was probably due in part to edgar wright providing all the extras with a dvd of zombie clips to gen up on prior to filming as explained at a postscreening q and athere are many many laugh out loud moments the first zombie kill scene in the garden will go down as a classic but also some genuine scares the bathroom in particular remains in the memorylots of cool sound effects and editing a la spaced combined great writing and acting give the film a very slick feel which certainly belie its presumably low budgetclearly a loving homage there is nothing here for the snootier horror fan to get upset about  one thought though  as this is the first film shouldnt it have been called dwight of the living deadunreservedly recommended,black_comedy
being a massive spaced fan i was lucky enough to get free tickets to the preview of this movie  i was extremely keen to see it and for that reason i think i may have been a bit disappointed with what i sawwithout giving too much away its pretty much spaced plus zombies minus brian and daisy only having the smallest of parts  theres some other familiar faces in there too from the likes of the office and others plot wise its pretty much a none event but if youre like me you wont care i watch these actors because they make me laugh and theyve pretty much succeeded again  the only down side for me was that the laughs werent more sustained and serious moments kept popping up towards the endall in all not a bad effort by simon pegg and his mates  id say 4 out of 5 and you should find it funny regardless of how much youve been following this bunch provided you have a sense of humour that isrole on spaced series 3 itll make a lot of people very happy including me,black_comedy
just got back from a screening of and just have to say that the film was fantastic there was only a few people in the screening but they were all laughing even the people who came in by mistake thinking it was gothika though theyll probably laugh just as hard at thatsimon pegg was brilliant as was the supporting cast filled with brit comedy cameosand the movie was filled with real moments of sadness and pathos which is welcome in this genre i watched the remake of dawn of the dead the day before and this movie although enjoyable is not a patch on shaun cant wait to see it again with a full audience especially the part where they beat the landlord at the local pub with pool cues all to the tune of queens dont stop me now legendary pegg was asked in an english magazine about the chances of a sequel to which he replied from dusk till shaun cant wait to see if he does it,black_comedy

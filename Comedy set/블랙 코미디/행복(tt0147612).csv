i wasnt going to write a comment for this one but after reading all the nasty things said about it and considering that was the basis for one of my final undergraduate philosophy papers i feel a duty to defend itfirst of all what youve heard is true this movie is very graphic and almost impossible to sit through without covering your eyes at least once however it is worth noting that the most uncomfortable scenes are uncomfortable precisely because of an empathy that the audience establishes with the characters it is that precisely that empathy which often pulls the audience in a direction opposite from social mores that makes us squirm  i dont know how many of the other critics here are schooled in film theory but that kind of powerful emotional effect is typically considered a good thing in films  so really what most people object to about this film is the content regardless of what they want other to believethat said this really is a wonderful film precisely because of the level of human understanding empathy and reality it encompasses  it portrays human nature from the inside out where it is least dignified and most pathetic what we see are a number of people desperately scrabbling around for fulfillment because they have all to some degree achieved the fulfillment of their desires and found it hollow  since they dont realize this fact themselves most people dont they look for that fulfillment they feel entitled to by using other people  it is this fundamental destructiveness of human desire written about masterfully by zizek which causes the evils in this filmi put evils in quotes because as solondzs film masterfully demonstrates there is no evil to be found in this film there is only humanity and suffering  this absence of moral judgment though disquieting is what allows the spectacular sense of empathy and full moral complexity of this filmthus the moral of the film is that the surest way of destroying is to seek it  and that i feel is a message that not only makes this a great film but also an artwork of tremendous social value,black_comedy
gradually as i watched this movie i became aware that i was witnessing some of the most powerful and honest acting writing and directing i had ever experienced and im glad because if this material had been attempted by anyone without extreme skill and sensitivity it would have been a monstrous disaster as it is i dont think i would add it to my dvd collection i dont know if i could watch it again and im not sure id feel comfortable people seeing it on my shelf unless they knew me well there are moments of great hope in this movie when you think misery may finally give way to there are moments of great honesty when a character says just what youd expect them to say and you realize how safe every other movie character has been in comparison the humor that other reviews talk about is not the kind of humor that makes me laugh personally its the dark visceral humor of human weakness meanness and even pathology i still appreciate it for what it is and it is used in a profound and delicate way i highly recommend this movie to anyone who is willing to accept that life and especially sexual life is really much more complex and difficult than we usually admit i recommend watching it alone or with a friend or partner with whom you can discuss the most emotionally difficult topics this movie will test you if you stick with it but youll know you saw something profound,black_comedy
this is one of the best movies ive ever seen but i would hesitate to recommend it to people whom i dont know pretty well  it explores aspects of life and living and suffering that most films avoid or actively deny and it does so brilliantly  the characters are vividly real and there is such a strong sense of situations unfolding in real time that its truly mesmerising  i felt like a fly on the wall eavesdropping on conversations i could never hear otherwise  i think many people would absolutely hate this movie partly because it doesnt pass judgement on behaviours that are repulsive to the bulk of humanity and partly because it exposes us to them at all,black_comedy
there are only a handful of films that have a distinct polarizing affect on the audiencea clockwork orange the cook the thief his wife  her lover and i would even lump in american beautythese are movies you either get or you dont and if you dont get it you will hate it open minded viewers need only apply and thats certainly the case with i remember leaving the theater absolutely shocked and not just because of the events on screen i was shocked that i found the movie so intelligent and oddly entertaining the actors surely must have felt that after reading the screenplay and there are some big actors in thisveterans like ben gazzara louise lasser elizabeth ashley mixing with new talent like philip seymour hoffman camryn manheim dylan baker lara flynn boyle etc the subject matter is truly unsettlinga parental figure respected in his community does some horrible things and this is the main reason why so many people have a hard time with this movie did this material really need to be examined in modern cinema well yesin the same way that david lynch had to explore it in blue velvet is a masterpiece of irony even in the title and finds humor in the most unusual and downright bizarre circumstances you will not see another movie like it guaranteed and fair warningyou could very well despise it and its probably a fair estimate that its writerdirector todd solondz doesnt give a damn,black_comedy
centred around a new jersey based family of three sisters their parents and their partners and acquaintances this film looks at their lives  involving a lonely sister a sister with a good family life a paedophile a telephone sex pest and an elderly couple breaking up the film follows their short stories through whatever it takes themi remember hearing this film reviewed as being pretty good but it was pointed out by the critic that it was far from a movie to take a first date to  seeing it now for the first time he was very right in fact i would say it is the type of film that could make a partner worry about you if you suggest you watch it together  what type of audience this was made for is questionable but it is not without merit even if it is very very bleak the actual plot is no more than a collection of stories that roughly overlap due to the characters relationships to one another  most of these work well enough and are interesting but the odd one falls slightly flat  allens overweight flatmate goes a little too far and the russian thief subplot is not really engaginghowever for most of the film the stories are very engrossing despite being very sad  the plot assumes unof one form or another to be a given as part of life and i think that that is a pretty fair assumption  some of the characters bring it on themselves some of them are simply alone however all the scope of human misery is here even if it takes the form of events that not everyone will be able to relate to  no matter whether or not you like the characters you will feel for them  they are very well written and the dialogue feels natural  while the paedophile character will turn many stomachs i did respect the film for not monsterising himbaker plays him very well and mixes it with all the hallmarks of a normal guy  his chats with his son form a strand that runs through the film well and is ultimately quite moving and hard to watch  hoffman and boyle dont really have a great deal to do and their characters were harder for me to buy into as their relationship was not clear  all the cast do a good job regardless mainly because the characters are very well written and fit together in a great ensemble presentation  special mention should go to lovitz for a great little cameo that opens the film  in 4 minutes he gives a better performance than i have seen him give anywhere elseoverall this film is not an easy fun film to watch but it is very well written even if some of the threads do not engage as much as the others the conclusion of the film offers no respite and only sees a collection of characters hurt by themselves or others who have little hope for the future other than to just keep plodding on  like it or not the message of the film is powerful even if the presentation doesnt do anything to make it accessible  when rem close the credits singing where are you ive searched so long for you it is difficult not to feel something,black_comedy
 1998  out of fourtodd solondz writer and director of describes his perplexing film as a series of intertwining love stories stories of connections missed and made between people how people always struggle to make a connection and to what degree they succeed or dont its about relationships obsessions and stunning discoveries both private and social it contains some very graphic materialenough that the filmmakers released it without an mpaa rating even as the film exploits extreme adult themes and graphic content it does not glamorize or stylize its subjects rather it uses them to paint a disturbing picture of the dark side of human naturethe film connects with the audience because these characters feel realthey are ordinary people with serious problems it takes place in a homely suburbia environment in which solondz draws us in and eventually pushes us far away with enough provocative content to stand next to a clockwork orange the movie does however know what to show on screen and what not to its smart and indecisive not dirty and gratuitous the film defines the characters relationships very well doesnt explore random unrelated characters their separate lives do however connect and the movie does a great job revealing those connectionsfollows a complicated story woven through the lives of many characters joy jordan jane adams a middleaged telephone sales person living by herself in new jersey longs for a decent relationship after recently breaking up with her boyfriend jon lovitz her parents mona louise lasser and lenny ben gazzara are pending a divorce through their catalyst neighbor elizabeth ashley joy has two sisters trish cynthia stevenson and helen lara flynn boyle helen brags about how many men lust for her while trish is a chripy homemaker married to a therapist named bill dylan baker bill appears to be a typical husband and father but he is really a homosexual pedofile who masturbates over teen idol magazines and molests the friends of his preteen son billy rufus reed bill however has done a good job at hiding his disturbing feelings from his friends and familybilly confronts his father about his developing sexuality while bill is also riddled with sex discussions as one of his patients allen philip seymour hoffman obsessively raves about having sex with helen they meet one day when allen makes one of his usual obscene phone calls and helen enjoys his heavy breathing and wants to make love with allen a large woman camryn manheim who lives in the same apartment complex as allen often knocks at his door  she likes allen but he is too busy shuffling through porno magazines and making explicit phone calls to random women to notice those feelingsin the production notes producer ted hope describes todd solondzs vision as comedic tragedy todd knows how to maintain that fine balance between heartbreak and humor youre often unsure whether to laugh or cry the dialogue always riveting and thoughtprovoking sometimes shocking with its irony and explicitness often perplexes us we are not quite sure how to respond to such phrasestake a scene where bill exchanges a conversation with the coach of his sons baseball team were not sure whether to laugh or weepwe feel a little humor and sadness mixed the coach is concerned of his own sons sexual statushe is afraid his kid is homosexual heres what their conversation involvescoach what do you think would happen if i got him a professional you know bill a professional coach hooker you know the kind that can teach things firsttimers you know break him in bill but joe hes 11 coach youre right youre right its too lateironic how i screened neil lebutes sexually provocative your friends  neighbors just days after this astonishing production both movies honestly examine deep human despair in disturbing frank detail i remember the dialogue in both films a specific scene in where billy asks his father some very difficult questions about molestation his father answers his son honestly no matter how difficult the questions goti compare that scene to the scene in your friends  neighbors where three men relax in a steam room and the character played by jason patrick verbally remembers his best sexual experience these sequences require numerous viewing they stare into the deep dark crevices of the heart and we can only watch in bafflement at the thoughtprovoking power these movies have and how they challenge our perspectives is one of the better films of the year,black_comedy
when a film opens with a scene between two people one breaking up with the other culminating in the dumped calling the dumper shit you know youre in for something dark with this film when the scene is followed by the simple opening title written in pretty cursive writing you know its going to be ironic as well was written and directed by todd solondz the mind behind the film welcome to the dollhouse a film that was fantastic but really hard to watch if the viewer has any kind of heart follows in the same vein though this time instead of centering around one character solondz puts a new jersey family at the center of the film and develops new characters through their relationship with the familyoverseeing the family is mona jordan lasser the matriarch of the family who has just been told by her husband that he no longer loves her lenny jordan gazzara is simply sick of being tied to someone continuously while insisting that there is no one else joy jordan adams is a serially employed thirtysomething single female who is constantly belittled by her family and ignored by society she is most close to her sister trish maplewood stevenson a stay at home mother with three kids who likes to say she has it all her husband bill baker is a psychiatrist who outwardly appears to be a stoic family man but is actually a pedophile who within five minutes of the introduction of his character goes to a convenience store to pick up a teen heartthrob magazine so he can masturbate in the back seat of his car to the pictures of the young boys on the cover the third sister in the family is helen jordan boyle an author recently made semifamous for an angstridden published diary filled with lies who has a very high opinion of herself and a way of making others feel badly about themselves while never raising her smoothasglass voice or making her jabs obvious her neighbor allen hoffman is in love with her only he is so inept at socialization and unable to approach her that he attempts to satisfy his desires by first making random obscene phone calls to various women and then making helen a target herself another neighbor kristina manheim is an insecure quiet woman who is constantly trying to befriend allen possibly as a love interestthere is quite a cast of characters to this ensemble picture and the story lines become intricate and increasingly more complicated as the film progresses is filled with excellent character actors at the top of the list would certainly be hoffman but the most compelling character and character portrayal would be bakers character of bill maplewood obviously a film that deals unflinchingly with pedophilia and child rape particularly under the guise of a dark comedy is going to be held under closer observation but even under this scrutiny bakers portrayal is absolutely flawless while his character is a monster baker is able to provide a human side to it where i was left thinking he was a terrible man but also had sympathy for him because he had a sickness there are not many actors i can think of that could pull off this role as stupendously as baker did baker was the clear star of the film in my opinion but the performances of every person in the cast were fantastic as well particularly the young boy who played bakers oldest sonas i stated earlier is rife with irony because on the surface everyone is miserable however it soon becomes relatively clear that this is just how these people are and each of them to some extent are living in as misguided as it may appear to be everyone ends up being hurt or disappointed on some level but they are still together and seem to be satisfied to be in the destructively emotional rut they are in solondz who really has his finger on the pulse of misery just like when upon hearing that stephen king gets inspiration for his books from his dreams i was glad that he at least makes millions from being terrified at night i would hate to get a front row seat in solondzs psyche really gives the audience something to chew with i loved the chances he took with the subject matter i loved the performances and i loved the film as a whole because it was just so damn well done its not an easy film to watch and its not an entirely pleasant one to watch at times but it is truly a piece of genius with the way it is intricately put together envision trying to glue tiny shards of crystal into place with a tweezers  the characters in are as fragile and ready to shatter at any moment whether they can see it for themselves or not 810 shelly,black_comedy
i dont want to waste time analyzing the plot since others have covered it so well basically here we have a robert altmanesqe pastiche of characters stemming from a seemingly normal family plus others who come into their lives solondz sets them up and examines their lives their dreams their interactions and their facades whats important is that he doesnt judge these people and even more importantly he doesnt condescend to his audience like it or not the people in this movie do exist and i think viewers instantly realize thatthis movie stirs up such strange emotions its tough to admit that we may have something in common with a suburban pedophile a pathetic dreamer a pretentious literary snob or a obscene telephone sex stalker and one of the most frightening ideas ever put on film is here solondz makes plausible the people we view as being sick or generally look down upon arent that much different than us they still want the same things we do and he also questions the ideals america seems to hold most dear like monogamy and morality and yeah how exactly do you find is anyone really happyi cannot recommend enough neither can i with the directors equally impressive and incisive welcome to the dollhouse its just an extraordinary movie surprisingly funny intelligent brutally honest powerful original and relevant the cast is thoroughly excellent and solondz follows his own compass at all times in both the scripting and directing department hes a brave filmmaker and i really have a lot of admiration for directors and writers who stray away from the tired hollywood blockbuster formula good for some popcorn sure but arent you glad theres other stuff out there to choose fromreading some of the other reviews posted here i was surprised at the amount of negative comments i guess this isnt for everyone out there if you want a fun night of fantasy escapism or a brainless comedy dont bother but if you want a blisteringly funny dose of reality then dont miss this definitely a top contender for my 10 favorite movies of the 1990s list,black_comedy
i recently saw my first todd solondz film welcome to the dollhouse what a dark ridethis week it took a couple of evenings for me to get through there was a lot to get goodness gracious as my dear grandmother might say who incidentally is not a candidate for viewing this oneid read the reviews for in 1998 id had a typically positive psychic movie reviewer moment this indie sounded unique i waited for  sniffle  to appear upon my friendly video store shelves but saw nada i imagine that the store probably had like two copies maybe displayed briefly upon a bottom shelf someplace i forgot about the existence of this film until recently and i recently heard that a certain video chain had allegedly pulled from its shelves due to customer complaintsdisturbing yet intriguing this film pulled me along the matrix of character interaction becoming increasingly more intricate and strange definitely not for all tastesthe subject of child sexual abuse is handled matter of factly yet chillingly and effectively as with the domesticsexual abuse of women the problem of child sexual abuse is obviously one that crosses lines of class social status and profession acknowledges this fact in the character of family manpsychiatrist bill maplewoodloneliness rage sexual repressionobsession disintegrating marriages sadly sophisticated children relationships built upon artifice this film has it all its prozac cinema at its best try to be on an even keel when pressing playspouses parents and children seem to be communicating across a voidafter viewing for the second time i realized that the entire soundtrack intentionally consisted of melodramatic andor ultra perky canned music a perfectly ironical compliment and contrast in style with the strong harsh quirky film scenespresentation director solondz sets up the viewer for traditional fatherson talk scenes via mood and pseudo canned music giving the subject matter and dialogue all the more impact what did he just say ward and beaver cleaver never behaved this waygot 134 minutes and a desire to see something darkly different rent or buy it,black_comedy

to call todd solondzs a dark comedy is to redefine the words dark and comedy it hates the world and everyone in it and takes great pleasure in mocking people stupid enough to try to be happy in solondzs world life is pointless hope is for suckers and everybody is basically bad at heart it says something that the movies most human sympathetic character is a child molesterand yes its a comedy  often a very very funny one funny in a morbid gallows humor dead baby joke sort of way but funny nonethelessthe chief characters in are all stunted narcissistic and hopelessly inadequate joy jane adams is a born loser who drifts through a series of menial jobs and drives her boyfriend to suicide her sister helen lara flynn boyle is so selfabsorbed that she thinks her biggest problem is that everyone loves her too much her neighbor allen philip seymour hoffman can only connect to people by making obscene phone calls and bill dylan baker his therapist and joy and helens brotherinlaw is a pedophile who rapes two of his 11yearold sons friends somehow solondz makes these horrible people really really funny like john waters and the farrelly brothers solondz finds humor in ugliness and revels in bad taste he makes sexual dysfunction and personal failure brutally funny allens obscene phone calls for example are almost endearing in their ineptitude and anatomical incorrectness im gonna f you in the ear while helens narcissism makes her gloriously clueless if only i had been raped as a child  then i would know authenticity solondz shows his characters in a clear satiric light and it despises themwhile solondz may not like his characters he does not take the easy way out by making them caricatures every one of these awful human beings is a threedimensional character with reasons for being awfulfor example most directors would have made bill a onenote villain but solondz makes him a pitiful monster who is tortured by ghastly sexual urges that he knows are wrong theres a tough scene near the end where bill has a frank talk with his son billy about his pedophilia admitting that he enjoyed raping his victims that he would do it again and while he would not rape his own son he would jerk off instead both father and son are crying  billy with horror as he realizes just what bill is and bill with shame and despair as he realizes the same thing its hard to watch but its an acting master class and absolutely fearless filmmakingthis is a real actors movie the cast gives careerbest performances baker is both horrifying and heartbreaking as bill he squirms in his own skin as if he is being eaten alive by his own sickness we pity him whether we want to or not hoffman is hilariously pathetic as allen sweating and mumbling with lonely selfhatred adams is sad and sweet as the luckless helen the closest thing the movie has to a moral center while boyle is priceless as the contemptible helen swanning around as if waiting for the world to thank her for being bornis the epitome of acquired taste  its humor is bitter acidic and often cruel and it takes real joy in offending the audience go elsewhere for a feelgood comedy with a happy ending if nothing else though its a true original and deserves credit for carving out its own niche in the dark comedy genre,black_comedy

yknow i think ive seen quite a lot of what this world has to offer not everything certainly but ive seen and accepted my fair share of ugliness and i think i can say that it takes quite a lot to rattle me but after seeing if nothing else i know where my limits are i never want to be this jaded i never want to be able to watch this much degradation and humiliation and be able to shrug it off as hip or genius i think its fair to say that for someone numb enough to detach themselves from this film you could appreciate it for the acting and for the quality of the filmmaking in general and i am on some level glad that it was made there is a place for films like this one but even with my own really quite liberal attitudes towards artistic expression i sincerely do hope that marks the lowest point to which our culture ever descends i fear for our collective integrity if we are able to leave a film like this one without being disgusted and upset,black_comedy
this is the best movie i never ever want to see again its dark disgusting powerful painful and honest the focal point of cinema has been used here as an assault on every day life everyone has had these moments at one point or another in their lives and now heres the hotfaced shame and moral nausea experienced vicariously through a parade of terrible terrible people not parsed out by blessed months or years between horrifying events as one would hopefully find in real life but nonstop for however many minutes this film lasts i cant deny that it was a good film but its also a film that hurts to watch good job in an era when the only thing i can remotely equate this experience to is being in the front row at cloverfield and being surrounded by people vomiting,black_comedy
is a gruesome and uncomfortable drama about sexual dysfunction focusing mainly on three characters a 30something woman who lives with her parents and attracts romantic disaster a schlubby office drone who cant speak to his sexy neighbor so he masturbates while making obscene phone calls and a seemingly normal therapist who lusts after his sons prepubescent friends forget the dark comedy label  i found almost nothing even remotely funny in the movie and in fact the overall effect was completely depressing is an interesting movie but it wasnt funny or entertaining in the traditional sense of the word and its nothing id ever want to see againat times the film felt like a hollow exercise in wallowing in the misery of the characters i imagined the main protagonists as ants and the writerdirector sitting there with a magnifying glass making them burn their humiliations are sometimes played for laughs in ways that didnt always work jon lubitzs bitter opening monologue after hes dumped  hilariously awkward faux happy music playing when another character is on his way to raping a preteen err no the material is too serious to treat in such a cavalier way really reminded me of the ice storm except that movie addressed similar themes in an intelligent way with real characters and asked us to take the situation seriously the ice storm also offered a glimmer of redemption which struck me as far truer to life than the empty nihilism on display herewants to rub our nose in the sordid details  was there any reason to show two separate scenes of dripping cum  but doesnt really have much to say the film is very wellacted and its certainly interesting so its worth watching i just think a movie this deliberately offputting needs to have a stronger message than were all an fing mess,black_comedy
ive always stated that i dont like nihilistic films i dont enjoy films that show the world as something ugly depressing or mean spirited usually this applies to thrillers where everyone is coloured an ugly shade of grey where every victory is pyrrhic in nature or everyone is a villain to some degree but this film showed me that theres something i hate even more in a film this film shows the world as something heinous something perverted something rotten its not depressing per se except in that it will remove your will to live rather its disgustingtells about a group of sisters and the people they interact with in their day to day life their families their relatives their acquaintances their neighbours the film talks about the struggle of upper middleclass or at least what it perceives to be the struggle of upper middleclass it positions that these people are without a place their lives hollow and empty their purpose nonexistent it positions that to fill this gaping void in their souls these people turn to perversion pretty much every single character in the film is a deviant of some sort theres masturbation paedophilia rape mutilation of sexual organs and of course dirty phone calls everything under the sunand yet the film is amazingly grey in tone it sounds like a trashy bmovie but its not the whole film is like an awkward date with a complete stranger where neither says anything beyond the most placid of banalities and youre both happy to leave after the main coursethe worst thing is that i cannot deny this film the right to exist art any kind of art is meant to help us understand the world you can condemn the phenomena discussed themselves but you cannot condemn the discussion that must take place about the phenomenon even disgusting films like this one are a viewpoint into lifebut that doesnt mean i have to like it or agree with its message this is a horrid film is it worth seeing in a sick way yes but proceed with caution,black_comedy
dysfunctionality is an overrated dramatic tool and solondz  seems to rely on it exclusively too much of his material is deliberately solely and obsessively meanbe that as it may scores high with me because two out of six of its main characters transcend the ooeygooierthanthou schtick and emerge as really powerful and simultaneously amusing studies ive never seen a more scientifically balanced scene than the one in which a father is quizzed by his wounded son about his perversions it manages to be scary and sad and laughoutloud funny all at once,black_comedy
i stumbled upon this gem during one of my numerous internet research extravaganzas and boy was i pleasedis a dark comedy and for most its brutal to sit through but if you enjoy crude humor this movie is perfectthe plot is pretty basic three sisters and their encounters in new jerseywhen i look at a movie critically i usually weed out all the propaganda and controversy i seek for acting talent and creativity this movie was full of bothyes it is technically a disturbing movie but i urge you to view it with an open mind the performances in this film are forever engraved in my mind as spectacular and its just down right hilarious in a very crude wayphillip seymour hoffman has always been a brilliant actor in my mind and his role in this film was probably his best dylan baker should have gotten an oscar nomination but the academy awards are more focused on politics versus talent in my humble opinion so screw themthe magic of this movie is the character interaction and of course its shocking but entertaining contentdisturbing funny shocking its hard to analyze the entire movie without ruining everything im not a fan of spoilers go rent it or whatever and i caution you to not watch it with any person who is easily disturbed or offendedenjoy my crappy review ,black_comedy
another psychologically visceral film that pinches the nerve of human society i am still not quite sure which one is darker the human unconscious the dark basements of our fears or hypocrisy the attics of our warmest intents todd solonz masterpiece slaps you in the face and laughs about it the film transcends the meaning of the word dark or bizarre into daily or humane dysfunctional families have been a common topic since oedipus and hamlet to 400 blows ordinary people and many others however times change and human needs do also socially economically and emotionally behaviors laws and what i understand as common sense act hand in hand with interpretation of our unconscious needs and historical transition periods are relevant to understand these human recycling needs which are very present here as chaotic and real as possibleis a mindbending experience that reveals surprises and causes great reflection hopefully for some this therapeutic film might result in some real life happy moments for it hits the right note with the right prescription,black_comedy
its so obvious to me having seen this movie when it first came out and then having read the script for american beauty although i havent seen it yet that american beauty is a total homogenized dumbed down hollywood pc ripoff of which is a brilliant more truthful and far superior filmive read both scripts and is by far the greater script american beauty is a hollywood mainstream cop out of what had the real guts to say about lifeanyone who doesnt like this movie is living with their head in the sand and has forgotten all the little sordid details from their own lives i wonder how many people dissing this film have actually masturbated been sexually abused or had lustful thoughts about their neighbors themselves  its so hard for them to view because it throws their own lives right up at them on the screeni think this movie is incredible and one of the best films ever made  todd solondz should be applauded for his gutsiness to tell it like it is and not condemned  american beauty is a very pale substitute that was obviously contrived for those who dont have the guts to view,black_comedy
spoilersobviously is meant to be provocative just as all this directors films are desperately hoping that shock value will carry a film or at least generate a buzz unfortunately theres really nothing shocking about the most taboo of subjects it covers pedophilia has already been dealt with in other films much more artistically and thoughtfully consider lolita just because somethings disturbing doesnt mean its art and certainly doesnt mean its intellectualeven the most enthusiastic proponents of this film recognize that without some sort of interpretation the film is a catalog of perversion and deliberately disturbing imagesinnuendo but the enthusiasts of argue that theres something more to the movie that there is something funny ironic human or artful about the movie these enthusiasts of are quick to dismiss criticisms of the film as closemindedness or simply notgettingit but upon a closer examination its easy enough to see that the praises heaped upon this movie are done so out of intellectual weaknessfunny is always subjective and one cant really argue something isnt funny to someone else making fun of mentally retarded kids is funny to some people but its also cruel and shows a lack of compassion for others in order for to be see as funny its pretty much necessary to disregard any sympathy for the humanity of the characters in the film which in turn suggests that if you find the movie funny then you didnt actually get that the characters were people desperate for some sort of rather than ridicule or disdain conversely if you find the characters very human and are sympathetic towards them then youd be inclined to feel just as much sympathy towards their victims the main characters in act without regard for the consequences their actions might have on others this makes them sociopaths they seek their own sexual gratifications at the expense of others well being in fact once the object of obsession for one character makes herself available for whatever horrible thing he wants to do to her he no longer wishes to do so because shes consenting the point here is by claiming this movie is funny or human youre either laughing with sociopaths or disregarding some peoples humanity in favor of the desires of portrayed sociopaths either way its finding amusement in the rape of a child and trying to justify it behind artsome people have claimed is about irony this just shows that quite ironically they dont understand irony whether you use a prescriptivist or descriptivist definition of it isnt ironic the more applicable term would be incongruous often confused with ironic for example an optometrist with bad vision is not ironic its incongruous it would be ironic if he went blind from accidentally jabbing out his eyeballs with his eyeglasses but theres only incongruity in at least from what i remember of it not ironyso if isnt ironic comedic or something that displays humanity as in sympathy for people then the only way to defend it against the criticisms of its detractors is to say its art if you want to call anything produced on artistic mediums art then by all means is art its certainly a film with actors a plot and even a soundtrack but just because something is art doesnt mean its any good there is bad art we call things good art when they present something we find aesthetically pleasing intellectually stimulating or they capture the essence of a moment with precision from an aesthetic standpoint is mediocre simple camera panning and centered frames one can argue that the film captures the essence of the moment but unless youve been in that moment then its not really something youll ever be sure of and frankly i wouldnt want to be in any of the moments in this film you can argue that art is meant to show us things that we didnt already know to allow us to feel emotions which we normally dont at which point one is forced to wonder why anyone would desire to experience the awful situations the characters are put into its masochism and a sterile voyeuristic masochism at thatthe last argument i can imagine to justify watching this film is that its intellectually stimulating but how yes perverts and pedophiles are people too thats never been a matter of debate it is precisely because they are people that we condemn their actions and the hurt they cause others the only question left is should they be punished and wellyes rapists certainly deserve punishment regardless of whether they deserve sympathyfinally there are some who actually claim that this movie is worthwhile because it doesnt present a moral judgment but if we didnt already have moral judgments right or wrong on sexual perversion then we wouldnt be able to recognize any of the conflict in the film the whole movie revolves around individuals who are tortured by the recognition that what they desire is morally wrong this is why they hide their longings from society without the recognition of their perversions being morally wrong theres no inner conflict simply a litany of perversions happening the problem with is that the characters realizing their desires are considered amoral by their society try to satiate their desires and remain part of a society which condemns their actions rather than fully embracing their desires by finding a different society or fully embracing society by refraining from their actions their flaws are not sexual deviancy just stupidity and selfishness for which we are to feel sympathy why would anyone think was a good movie i can only conclude that they didnt get it felt confused and decided it was thus deep what a selfrighteous waste of film,black_comedy
when i watched this film i knew i was going to love it from the beginning it simply describes life most of us would love that time does not pass but it does for some it passes quickly for others slowly but it passes little children grow up and eventually become adults they have to perform sexual act to continue the species some parents take that fact with normal attitude others do not also time passes for some male adults who develop interest for younger people hm hm may be a little too young this film describes this film so wellacting is excellent plot is excellent as well everything is excellent about this film please make sure you watch it,black_comedy
 dir todd solondz  1998 the best scene in is the very first featuring jon lovitz in perhaps his best performance on screen lovitz is only in these first five or so minutes but delivers a distressing performance exploding from heartbreak when he is rejected for not being a traditionally attractive man it is an honest and true performance in a film filled with essentially loathsome characters the lovitz character is one of many who are disappointed with their current life situation but he is the only one who can conjure up any sort of sympathyphillip seymour hoffman plays the nebbish allen a lonely man who gets off on thoughts of his sultry neighbor helen lara flynn boyle and making prank phone calls joy jane adams finds herself 30 and without a career or a husband her two sisters are successful one being helen and the other trish cynthia stevenson who is happily married to psychiatrist dr bill mapplewood dylan baker allen confides his secrets to dr mapplewood but bill has a secret of his own an insatiable lust for young boyswants to be an ironic comedy about life but the film is too heavy handed to be found funny the child molestation subplot is too serious of a situation to be taken lightly the biggest problem is the angle to which it was approached the molestations take place offscreen and is as tastefully done as the subject allows but there is something slightly creepy about watching an eleven year old boy talk to his father about semen and masturbation obviously these scenes are to be shocking to the audience but they are a little too unsettling and they dont achieve their function for the film these conversations feed into the child molesters obsession but it would have been much more interesting had the film actually examined the psyche of the child molester instead of hinting at aspects and then dropping them to move on to a different subplot in the end the scenes are an exercise in pushing the sexual envelope but they dont amount to much and only make the film harder to sit throughthe audience is meant to relate to the characters in the film but it is very hard when all of them are so uninteresting and unlikable phillip seymour hoffmans character complains that no one likes him because he is boring and the film does nothing to disprove that it is hard for the audience to sympathize for a man who makes sexual phone calls and masturbates for 90 of his screen time the character of joy lives the saddest life and it is a shame that the screenplay never allows us to actually care about her she comes off as shrill and annoying and in those first scenes with jon lovitz a tad bit superficial her sister helen is just as uninteresting an author who is tired of being attractive to men shes not only superficial but a complete boreits a shame about the characters because the cast is full of consummate actors hoffman plays these types of characters perfectly but he never gets to do anything with it baker finds the ideal balance between normal family man and pedophile jane adams is merely serviceable and doesnt try to make her character any more likable stevenson is wonderful but boyle is a little overthetopthere is one other standout in the film and that is camryn manheim who manages to make the audience empathize with her even when she finds herself doing inhuman things but just the fact that the film feels the need to place her in such a situation proves how miserable the movie really wants to be many times scenes come off as completely inappropriate and unnecessary is two hours and twenty minutes drowned in unpleasantness it is a tough film to watch not only because of its subject matter but because of its sheer pessimism,black_comedy
at least this movie wasnt boring there was never a dull moment in this mess which might convince many viewers to overrate it fortunately dear reader i  am not such a vieweri enjoyed this movie while watching perhaps i would have rated it higher if not for the ending which i shall not spoil not that very much would be spoilt in any case but i wont spoil i would have rated it higher if my enjoyment was less derived from pure voyeurism and more from well developed characters and a terrific story this is the kind of film thats well directed and acted enough to resemble art but depraved and disgusting enough to appeal to the voyeur in us so we can excuse ourselves for sitting through it the artistic elements did not outweigh the negatives as you shall see in the following paragraphthe situations in the film were just not funny and thus in no sense can this be called a  comedy pedophilia is especially not very humorous there were scenes that i found to be quite gripping between a pedophiliac father and his son but they belong in a much better film not in a film that turns everything into a joke with an ending that made me mad everything here deserves a better ending perhaps a more tragic ending but at least a conclusion that wraps everything up in a way befitting a drama and less befitting a jim carrey comedythere also just isnt much substance here characters make obscene phone calls they have sick fantasies  they hurt others and themselves the lesson that  loneliness and desperation breed perversion is  hammered into our heads with one shock after  another we learn that seemingly banal and normal families have skeletons we learn that a child masturbating is funny we learn all of  his and more but what is the point dont waste your time here trying to find one its all  shock and no substance the material is better handled in american beauty a more mainstream  and also flawed but far superior filmif american beauty is rented out or something or there is nothing else on cable watch this you wont be bored but you certainly will not be enlightenedon another note i very strongly recommend the directors prior film welcome to the dollhouse which is quite easily one of the greatest and most perceptive movies about  teenagers,black_comedy
i watched this movie with my girlfriend and our mutual best friend and found it to be eerily true every seen my imagination would go to the worst possible scenario and the right before my eyes it was played out in some kind of sick horror show there is something to be said for a movie that involves pedophilia on a scale that makes you feel scared for the old man and how cruel people can be to each other and just when you think is found the fat chick has something in her fridgek if none of this makes sense it is because we all watched it while coming off some of the sickest acid trips of all time and we have been drinking since 7am great movie,black_comedy
there are certain films for which gratuity is utterly appropriate the cook the thief his wife and her lover for example is a film which is about human excessiveness so nothing feels over the top unfortunately everything that shocks the eyes and the senses just doesnt work in this movie tries to explore the dark side of middleclass america and i suppose the journey is taken but its an incoherent and poorlywritten exodus which a talented cast despite their efforts cannot save many moments of the film just felt like gratuity for the sake of gratuity which doesnt hold up well its not even that much of an offensive movie its just a kaleidoscope in which the colors are truly nonsymmetrical,black_comedy
in director todd solondz manages to craft a true masterpiece that will definitely make some people a bit too uncomfortable to really like or enjoy is certainly not for the easily offended or disturbed since it deals with some very mature and unsettling subject matter such as perversion rape pedophilia murder depression etc also surprises us by making the whole thing a comedy a really really dark comedybut still a comedythe dialogue is absolutely magnificent as i said this is a truly dark comedy so theres plenty of really really messed up and disgusting lines of dialogue throughout this film that made me howl with laughter and some are even hidden in really depressing sequences solondzs film manages to be an emotional roller coaster filled with sequences that are simultaneously funny and cold and it all somehow manages to workperformances are also pretty great each of the actors really becomes their character and reflect the deep sadness in this film as one can easily tell most of the characters in this film are severely lacking in any whatsoever making the title really ironic and this film is their journey to find trueand a lot of them sadly dontthe film is really spectacular in every sense of the word from the cynical twisted sense of humor to the more emotionally touching scenesis a masterpiece in every sense of the word no matter how sick vile or disturbing it really is,black_comedy
is a film that has nothing to say to me as its about a version of america i dont recognize and have never seen director todd solondz whose style and choice of subject matter could best be described as repellent seems to think all americans are living miserable fractured lives and anyone whos not is lying about it this is an ugly film filled with ugly characters doing ugly things that ultimately has very little to say solondz may have fancied himself a new and daring artist at the time of this films release but showing a cum shot on film does not a groundbreaking or profound movie maketodd solondz belongs to a small group of filmmakers lars von trier is another who primarily want to use cinema as a device to drive people away making one wonder why they want to make movies at alli hate this moviegrade f,black_comedy
this movie provides an excellent example of why no one should ever believe that the academy awards actually represent an honest view of the best films made in any given year the management and members of the academy are constantly pandering to the prejudices of groups who like to act as some sort of moral watch dogs this means that films that tackle gritty subjects like molestation must never be considered as award worthy lest these self appointed groups get offendedif you enjoy incredibly great script writing direction and acting this is a movie for you if you are too narrow minded to appreciate the realities of life around you stick to disney,black_comedy
i have often opined that our creative media paints pictures of life that though compelling are not necessarily authoritative movie love relationships are fabrications maybe people dont really feel or act this wayi hated this movie to the soles of my feet as did my teenage daughter as we watched it in utter disgust this director conceives of the ugliest situations that life could present but probably has never actually done so and has them acted out brilliantly by some of the best actors of our era utter vileness not that i am a prude i can abide fecesjust not some artificial brandi mentioned this film to a coworker who said that he and his so walked out demanded and received a refund from the theater manager that kind of filmlet me add this the money shot as they say in porn films comes when an adolescent boy finally has his first orgasm which is immediately lapped up by the family dog who then goes and gets a kiss from the boys mother that kind of movie,black_comedy

brought to you by the same hubris as american beauty but with nowhere near the execution attempts to disturb and disgust in the finest pink flamingoes tradition with none of that films weak wit  many spoilers ahead if you were to put together a wish list of everything you could want in a film would it include two cum shots including one from an 11yearold boy  said young boy crying because his father wont rape him  repeated scenes of a disturbed obscene caller who has no redeeming qualities whatsoever  highquality actors embarassing themselves  really bad russian accents  thats always a plus for meif all of the above are your idea of brilliance in film then by all means is for you  apparently this is solondzs paean to suburbia where all denizens are thoroughly depraved  you can tell because they act normal  the most normal one of all is dylan baker who is so normal in this film that hes catatonic  no just kidding he only acts that way so he can get into little boys pants  you know how you can tell hes a bad guy  hes the only one whos married with two young children thats how thats hollywoods clue to fiendishness and deception  you see every married man is really either a beerdrinking abuser or a tightassed pedophile  the two fathers of young children in this movie split that right down the middle with the father of the victim screaming at his son while the police are trying to interrogate him  you can tell hes the abuser because he shaves his head and wears his flannel shirt unbuttoned and untuckeddont even get me started on the sisters of the pedophiles wife and the truly bizarre subplot involving philip seymour hoffman who should know better and camryn manheim who sets back plussize women about 50 years in this role  suffice it to say that all three women usually do outstanding work but go through this picture like deers caught in headlights  instead of actually delving into the unbelievable terror and anger that must come with finding out your spouse is a serial rapist solondz simply skips over that and puts up a six months later gel  selloutthe final scene which involves the 11yearold boy masturbating on a balcony is so stilted and surrealistic you get the idea that jennifer lynch wrote it on a break from boxing helena  three grown women sit around a table asking a fourth when shell set them up with someone for them as if they were all twelve years old  and this includes the womens mother  she even promises to find someone for her father but this is all forgotten when the boy walks into the breakfast and announces his first success as a sex offender  just after the films aforementioned pink flamingoes momentoh yes  boy how could i not miss the brilliance of this flick  give me a break  solondz makes a perfect case for diagnosis for arrested development you get nothing akin to human interaction everyone in this film seems like they heard about humans from watching a john waters film  as drama its laughable and as comedy its anything but,black_comedy
warning  spoilers any film whose final shot consists of a pubescent twelve year old proudly announcing i came to his dumbfounded mother aunts and grandparents obviously has something wonderfully original going for it when it comes to comic affirmations it just doesnt get much more fundamental even better on the way to its climactic climax takes us through an endlessly inventive series of encounters with a large cast of characters almost all of whom leave an indelible imprint on the imagination and emotions john irving in one of his novels defines life as an xrated soap opera thats also not a bad description of a taboobreaking tragicomedy centering on the lives of the three jordan sisters and their intersecting relationships with parents  spouses boyfriends neighbors and each other the preopening credit sequence sets the disruptive stage by inserting us into a scene of what appears to be a conventional boygirl restaurant breakup involving the youngest sister inaptly named joy  played with buster keaton like understatement and wideeyed innocence by jane addams and the first of three boyfriends who mark the beginningmiddleend of her trajectory in the screenplay however this scene like the movie that follows from it plays itself out in anything but conventional terms as the boyfriend jon lovitz retracts a sentimental if hilariously inappropriate gift and launches into a withering  speech about which one of them is st cut to a title card musically accompanied by a catchy ditty about the elusiveness of ah yes this is not a julia roberts  hugh grant romantic comedy we have going here the second of the three jordan sisters trish cynthia stevenson is an aggressively middleclass suburban housewife who has it all including a sympathetic psychologist husband who just happens to be a closet pederast even the traumatic outing her husband receives doesnt seem to shake trishs insufferable optimism or her grip on as defined by consumer mythology  the third sister helen lara flynn boyle is a glamorous and in demand poet who writes about rape but secretly fears that her shallowness and inauthenticity will be discovered out of selfloathing she falls for an obscene telephone caller who tells her shes nothing and that hed enjoy attempting a copulatory removal of her cerebrum or words to that effect ironically the voice turns out to belong to her nerdy neighbor the brilliantasalways philip seymour hoffman who she has never deigned to even so much as glance at other strange characters populating the world of include a very obese woman who is raped by an aging hispanic doorman half her size with a rambo neck twist she kills him in the act and then keeps his body parts in refrigerator baggies there is also a passionate russian cabdriver who seduces joy in order merely to steal her cd player and the guitar she uses to compose the folksong that gives the film its title the jordan sisters parents lenny and mona ben gazarra and louise lasser add still another layer of mawkish comedy as their forty plus year marriage comes apart in an interpersonal dynamic somewhere between seinfelds costanzas and danny devitos roses why couldnt you have done this twenty years ago mona rails now ill have to get another facelift while writerdirector ted solondz welcome to the dollhouse obviously develops his characters and events in an absurdist style that is always precariously verging on going overthetop enough truth and realism are retained to make the viewer cringe in recognition gasp in discovery recoil in horror and laugh in sympathy at the grotesque yet alltoohuman behavior the film depicts is not for all tastes but it is a marvelous little dark comic gem nonetheless,black_comedy
i am amazed that this movie merits so many positive reviews however there are other reviews out there that i concur with as far as their negative views about this film for example it has been touched on by some astute individuals that provocativeness does not makes something intellectual or interesting also that the dialog is unrealistic and the plot devices contrived robbing this film of any value as commentary on any real phenomena or situation i also agree with the person who said that jon lovitzs brief role at the beginning is about the only good thing about this movie but even that cant raise this movie above a rockbottom awful rating even the brilliantly talented philip seymour hoffman is a waste in this movie treading no new ground and playing the most generic onedimensional uninteresting role in the long line of misfits and weirdos he has portrayed during his careerthis movie is not art it is crap trainspotting was provocative and at times repugnant and it was a great work of art but it was not by virtue of being provocative and repugnant that it was art i hesitate to even make comparisons between a waste of 2 hours of peoples lives like and a classic like trainspotting but i will make a couple of brief ones in trainspotting you have deep rich characterization the foundation for which is laid out in the screenplay and then is fleshed out by the actors though on the surface a story about depraved drug addicts it also transcends that to become a thought piece on the human condition and the realism and believability of the story are what allow it access to this higher ground in the characters are merely cardboard cutouts there to enact the writerdirectors aimless sicko fantasies which are neither interesting pieces of imagination nor believable scenarios and provide the viewer with nothing of any interest to ponder the portrayals are 1 dimensional and it seems hard to blame the actors since even someone of hoffmans abilities can extract little from the scriptto borrow a phrase from spinal tap the artistic level of this movie cannot be charted it is treading water in a sea of retarded sexuality and bad poetry,black_comedy
im sorry to say i watched the whole long video i kept thinking it would get better or make progress  it didntit started out with a great cameo by john lovitz and then took you on a wandering trail of excruciatingly normal people doing perverse things the characters are so boring that you hope their perversions will at least be interesting  they are notit could have at least explored the perversions to the degree that it helped satisfy the curiosities we have about them or help you understand them better  it didntit is listed as a comedy but it wasnt very funny i dont see what is funny about pedophilic rape thankfully we are spared the actually viewing of the actthe real problem is that the characters say things that people never would say i kept saying no way that isnt what would happen if it had be done to the humorous extreme  it would have be funny but instead i came away feeling a bit ill and frustrated for having wasted my time,black_comedy
imagine youre surfing youtube and come across a disturbing video  lets say its a video of a group of teenagers viciously bullying a schoolmate they insult the victim in every way they can think of calling him ugly stupid weak repulsive and on and on imagine they start pushing him then slapping then kicking he tries to get away but they wont let him escape the victim is afraid and he is clearly suffering intensely yet his pain only seems to bring his attackers more joy now imagine the clip ends abruptly with no resolutionis much like this imaginary youtube clip but magnified and stretched over two hours the film has no plot in the sense of a meaningful series of events things happen but there is no story being told the film functions only to document human ugliness and suffering in the most agonizing detail possible it depicts several people causing and experiencing suffering and then eventually the credits rollive seen other films that had no storyline some of which i think were very good so when i say that has no plot i dont mean it as a criticism im simply stating a fact ive also seen many films that depicted human suffering and in fact i think the majority of my favourite films have done so to a greater or lesser degree this is not surprising since art is largely about the human condition and whatever else it might involve that condition certainly has its share of sufferinghowever the crucial difference between films i have enjoyed and is how that suffering is depicted films are not mirrors there is no such thing as simply showing the world as it really is  or rather every film show the world as it is in some aspect what distinguishes the good ones is that they show it to us in a way that is surprising compelling enlightening etc so those who claim that a film is art by which they usually mean good art simply because it depicts suffering are very mistakensome examples of films that have depicted suffering effectively include american beauty taxi driver jacobs ladder last tango in paris etc though all very different they all share one common feature they allow us to relate to the characters whose pain we are witnessing we may not condone or agree with their actions but we see why they are doing them we may not share their motivations but we understand them we are shown how their fears and desires lead them into and through and sometimes miraculously out of their particular sufferings it is this revealing of the sad and beautiful complexity beneath our common human suffering that makes these films greatin i saw none of this revelation i saw only the characters ugly surfaces deformed by the wounds they sustained andor inflicted on others even when supposedly deeper motives were revealed these too proved to be equally shallow and equally deformedthe question that immediately rose to mind upon watching was why why did todd solondz make this movie i have found three possible answers the first is that he thinks that watching people suffer in the way presented in this film is funny i hope this is not the case if so i would like to say to solondz and to those people who have described as a comedy please seek out the help of a good counsellor or caring friend because right now you are very very lost the scenes in shouldnt evoke laughter any more than watching a handicapped child get beaten should while im sure there are people who would laugh in both cases this doesnt mean there is anything funny in either such scenes can be laughed only in the absence of empathy and without empathy were less than human and life is little more than a confused nightmarethe second possibility is that solondz wanted to inflict the disturbing content of this movie on audiences as a form of violence if solondz sees the content of his film for what is really is  the psychological equivalent of torture porn  then what motive could he have for making it other than as an expression of anger or hatred towards his anticipated audiencefinally perhaps the most generous possibility is that in solondz is just showing us the world as he sees it if this is so then i feel a great deal of sympathy for him for it is a miserable and empty world indeed in fact i find it hard to imagine anyone seeing the world so bleakly and yet still wanting to continue living in it personally i think even a week of such unremitting wretchedness would have me wishing for deaththese are the only explanations for this film that i can imagine and the few alternative explanations ive read have all been based on mistaken or seriously limited views of art or life itself i wish i were wrong because whichever of my explanations you agree with is very sad film its sad that such a film was ever made and sad that people enjoyed it,black_comedy
this film baffled me like no other film whilst a certain times i found it painful to watch and felt like switching off something else might happen and i was was transfixed im not sure whether to give this one star or ten i dont know if its good are bad in hindsight im probably leaning towards the latterits one of those multiplot films that switches between different stories think pulp fictionalthough quite different im not really sure what the film is exactly trying to say if anything all as there is so many issues at hand its almost like a series of short stories bundeled together with the fact that its 3 sisters and their lives its centred around just seems like a convenience doomed relationships broken dreams paedophilia adolescence familysibling relationships frustration desperation sexual frustration murder rape emptiness  loneliness are just some of the themes dealt with here but little in the way ofits hard to descibe the film you just need to watch it really to make up your own mind some of the acting is fabulous philip seymour hoffman  dylan baker are standout in awkward roles there is a lot of explicit  objectionable materiel to make one squirm some of which i found pretty needless not that im easily offendedbut when you see someone masturbating you kinda get the picture you dont need to see the semen dripping down the wall just as an example the paedophilc father having a somewhat ridiculously honest conversation with his 11 year old son after hes been arreseted and released on bail its just a tad surreal like much of this film this is a film that assumes to understand society  its problems but just gives it an exaggerated portrayal,black_comedy
todd solondz really has a true talent nobody can show the most despicable kinds of human behavior in such a deep and original way this film hits hard and works the plot is basically about three sisters trying to find their visions of but not just them everybody they meet or are surrounded by are trying to find their own visions too the problem is that their visions could be considered not right the first sister joy jordanjane adams is a struggling songwriter who is having a really hard time recovering from a harsh breakup with her mentally unstable exboyfriend andy kornbluthjon lovitz she befriends a russian man who falls in love with her but is also a thief the second sister helen jordanlara flynn boyle is a successful writer who is attractive and has good ideas but her neighbor allenphilip seymour hoffman makes obscene phone calls to her and she happens to be turned on by the disturbing threats due to a recent urge to be dominated but allens other neighbor kristinacamryn manheim is in love with him but has a murderous secret hidden under her somewhat cheerful exterior the third sister trish maplewoodcynthia stevenson is probably the happiest of the three she has three beautiful children and a loving husband bill maplewooddylan baker the problem is that little billy is going through puberty and decides to ask his dad whats going on his dad is the wrong person to ask because he is a pedophile who regularly rapes and abuses his sons friends he would never hurt his children however because he loves them to round off the circus of freaks are the three sisters parentsmonalouise lasser and lennyben gazzara who are losing control of their marriage like todd solondzs welcome to the dollhouse his following film is about a person or persons who want things that they cant have the film has a very real feeling style that may really screw with most viewers of this film the taboos on obscene phone calls child molestation and murder are thrown at the viewers with hard force despite being perhaps the most disturbing film ever made the movie has morals the mess of characters seem appropriate since the subject matter is so extreme the message on and sex may come at a price of the viewers emotions or their morals this film will be very difficult to sit through but as long as the viewers know that this is just a movie they will have nothing to be scared of this film despite making me a little more afraid to have children and making me lose sleep is very powerful and is the perfect black comedy the film has different kinds of humor in it but usually its the kind of humor that you would feel completely evil for laughing at but this film has a clever and original style with its horrifying characters its shocking dialog its utter bleakness rounding up with one of the most disgusting and heartbreaking endings of movie history,black_comedy
an excellent filman antidote to much of the current outputhard to watch uncomfortable to laugh with easy to summarisesex makes fools of us all,black_comedy
i dont see what all the fuss is about or the references to humor this is one of the saddest films ive ever seen the sex is joyless and everybody most of them rich and handsome and healthy is unhappy why i have no idea which is to say the film taught me nothing as it certainly was not entertaining why would anyone want to watch it and even pay for the privilege take away the shock value of the explicit dialogue and theres nothing left  and is anyone capable of being shocked by explicit language today a wholly unsatisfactory movie experience though i certainly dont share the fears of some posters that i wont be able to forget it im having trouble remembering it already,black_comedy
contempt might have been a better title for this movie because this seems to be all todd solondz shows for his characters throughout this feature hamstrung from the get go by an inconsistent set of performances dylan baker and cynthia stevenson are good phillip seymour hoffman is extremely mannered lara flynn boyle overdoes the superficial routine the movie tries to have its cake and eat it too  adopting a veneer of ironic detachment but still wanting to seem to be making a statement solondz badly misses the mark praise has been heaped on the purported sociorealism of this work but the bulk of the movie is premised on manipulative look what i can get away with shock value often in the from of heaping additional degradations on the characters for no apparent purpose other than to really cram their lives down the toilet  essentially the movie is saying that many people are really screwed up and have bad lives but offers nothing more than that superficial insight  while the movie does show glimpses of sincerity solondz constantly undermines any realism by utilizing cheap jokes  the 11year old masturbating dog licking up the ejaculate the mother kissing the dog and the boy bragging about his orgasm  this isnt as much tasteless as thoroughly at odds with the overall subject matter of the film thus the pedophaelia plot  which might have been better as the subject of a whole fully developed movie  never achieved full effectiveness as for comparisons with american beauty that was also a pretty shallow affair but compensated with great dialogue a better handling of different tones and consistently good acting,black_comedy
this is not about the title is ironical the film is about human isolation and the incapacity for all of the actors give spectacularly brilliant performances and not one is mediocre jane adams is sensational in a brave and open performance of which most actresses would have been incapable and so is the amazing lara flynn boyle who looks just like my friend annie hunt though not quite so beautiful who shares the same spellbinding quality as selma blair so that you just want to keep staring at her this film could and should have been a profound and moving film about its ostensible subject and the director has immense talent which he could have used to achieve that but instead he has betrayed his cast and the public by making a film filled with such gratuitously offensive and disgusting material that the film is ruined as a result and can only be described as utter trash let me explain we see a boy vomit on his breakfast plate we get to see the vomit of course we see a man ejaculate his sperm onto a wall and naturally we get a closeup of it then we see an eleven yearold boy ejaculate his sperm onto the railing of a balcony his dog comes along and licks it up and then goes and licks the mouth of the boys mother then there is the fat lady who killed the doorman she confesses it merrily about how she had to cut up his body and put the pieces in her freezer she says she is disposing of it slowly because such things take time at least we dont have to see the chopped up body though we are told about the penis and testicles in a bag all the characters in the film apart from two little boys who are raped are obsessed by sex like maniacs including the eleven yearold his father calmly describes to him how great it was to rape his friends and says he would do it again get the picture would you say that the director was totally insane i would but what about the people who have praised this perverted and horrifying vision of hell do you think that they are sane there have been plenty of crazy directors and i have even known some john huston and stanley kubrick for instance but no matter how disgusting and psychopathologically compulsiveobsessive they may have been in their own ways huston was a psychopathic sadist but otherwise thoroughly charming they never stooped to anything like this call for the men in the white coats if they still exist,black_comedy
i only rented this film because lots of other imdb reviewers compare it to american beauty a film i really enjoyed  indeed many reviewers insist this movie is the better of the two  i shouldnt have listenedid be lying if i said i didnt understand how other people can like this movie  i do  this is one of those films that receives such labels as daring or honest simply because it addresses subject matter that most films wouldnt touch with a tenfoot pole  thus many see genius in such a film only because it is unlike other movies  well ive got to say theres a difference between daring and exploitive and theres a huge difference between honest and gratuitous  too bad directorscreenwriter todd solondz apparently isnt aware of that  are all the disgusting visuals and gross sexual conversations really necessary  hasnt solondz ever heard of subtletyto put things into perspective here are some other movies that i really liked all of which are commonly considered offensive  i loved magnolia  i thought pulp fiction was excellent  the big lebowski was superb  fight club was kind of coolbut is trash the lowest form of trash  not content to assault his audience with the usual brand of sexual depravity solondz revels in violent sexual depravity  true solondz might not be endorsing this behavior but he is exploiting it and he is going too far  watching this movie goes something like this  someone does or says something unbelievably disgusting  you say to yourself wow i cant believe that just happened like a minute later something even nastier happens  again you say to yourself okay that was gross  why was that necessary  by the end of the movie youre like why did i watch it all  i should have stopped ten minutes into it  nothing in this movie was necessary  everything goes too far  every point this movie tries to make could have been made without being that grossin hisher review evilpays makes the claim that anyone whos offended by this movie needs to take a long look at themselves because it probably hit too close to home  well thats like saying that people who dont like shakespeare are literate or that people who hate titanic are sentimental  i was offended by not so much because its content was disgusting but because that content was sold to me as being something profound  ive been had and i am a little mad about it  and by the way the cameo appearances by jon lovitz and molly shannon only serve to make this movie creepy on top of everything elseis quite easily the single worst movie ive ever seen  and ive seen anaconda  ive seen leonard part 6  ive seen pauly shores jury duty  none compare  american beauty was nothing like this garbage 110,black_comedy
spoilers i will undoubtedly be told i am wrong by all the fans of this film and its directorwriter todd solondz my rating of one star is only due to not being able to rate lower than 1 star i am now going to be blacklisting the actorsactresses involved due to this film you might think that i am a prude and therefore biased based on the touchy subject matter you might think that i am secretly a closet child molester due to my huge dislike of this film i am neither i am a long longtime art cult and subculture film fan and father of three i have spent years watching the most disturbing degrading foul obnoxious lewd incorrect despicable pieces of filth ever brought to celluloid and enjoying them however my extreme dislike of this film is due to it falling into the sad use of the extreme to gain notoriety for example the use of the bodily fluids in my opinion was tasteless and unnecessary i have always stood against the films that try to act sophisticated and maybe even preach while having absolutely not message this is to me little more than a modern day exploitation film it can and should only be watched if you feel like having your stomach turned in a way that doesnt involve camera tricks or violence on the one other good note i did enjoy the direction in areas but i would never think it more than adequate it was not a reason to watch this nothing other than gross factor really is,black_comedy
this movie is basically the film american beauty thinks it is while american beauty comes across as a rather juvenile take on the underbelly of society tackles the kind of things others shy away from yes there are a couple of scenes i found unnecessary or too graphic ie the dog licking scene however overall this is such a thoughtful well written and subtlety acted movie this leaves the audience thinking it is very funny and yes at times serious and hard to watch but if the cinema were filled with more of these kind of movies it would be better for it also its a shame that independent brilliant movies like these are seen by so few when so many watch and praise pretentious crap like american beauty people who claim this is dark bleak and depressing are missing the point this film has humour but not the typical three stooges sledgehammer american humour if you like dramas with black humour and are tired of watching bad actors overact in predictable movies see this film,black_comedy
i agree with all of those who say that this movie was well written and directed  however i am uncomfortable with child actors dealing in such a direct manner with the subjects of rape and pedophilia  how does a director prepare a preteen to deal with the final scene between bill and timmy maplewood  how does a parent justify allowing a child to be in a very adult movie  i am not saying that child actors should only deal with happy life affirming subjectsbut goes too far,black_comedy
i foolishly bought the dvd solely on the recommendation of the auteurs and critics i respected that was a serious mistake on my part the mechanics of the movie photography writing skill editing etc may be adequate but the tone and the feel of the thing is dreadful as an american i strongly support the first amendment and i say these film folks certainly have the right to make this or any kind of movie great the public has the right to see it and buy it im totally supportive of that but i just wish i had been more fully informed so i could have made a more intelligent and appropriate decision for myself as it is this movie has left a greasy spot in my brain where it had lain i now have hellish images of depravity stuck in my mind i feel scarred and emotionally or psychically injured somehow and being unwarned as i was i feel ambushed blindsided if the low life nightmares depicted in this movie are for you fine welcome to it but couldnt someone other than the artsy critics have also commented on it beforehand of course shame on me i could have  should have rented a copy first which would have saved me the price of the dvd of course i still would have seen it though dang i trusted those guys,black_comedy
for the life of me i cannot understand why this film was on so many top ten lists last year  like his debut film welcome to the dollhousewhich was only redeemed by the performance of lead actress heather matarazzo this film from writerdirector todd solondz pretends to be saying something meaningful about our existence but is really only getting off on their troubles  unlike say the ice storm which is also a study of middleclass behavior but is objective towards its characters seems to revel in the cruelty each character suffers  we get paperthin characters as well doing crude rather than shocking things and then were supposed to pretend its satire  well im sorry but that aint satire  also there are some good actors hereim particularly a fan of jane adams and philip seymour hoffman but they all coast on mannerisms here  i wish i saw the film everyone else saw but what i saw was stupid rather than thoughtprovoking,black_comedy
this is the only movie that ever made me wish i could go back in time and unwatch it and i saw glitterit was depressing it was super lame and it was trying so hard to be deep and profound when it was just creepy it failed i was very uncomfortable and a little scared a lot of people liked it so right on but it just wasnt my cup of tea if youre a glutton for punishment i would so recommend this pseudointellectual film but if you have two hours to kill do yourself a favor and rent something with clint eastwood insteadthere are some really great actors in it but they all freaked me out and i wanted them to go away i didnt like any of the characters at all they are all bad pitiful people i guess that was my biggest problem everyone sucks everyones lives suck we get the point but sitting through two hours of these people just sucking at living is not so good,black_comedy
so i guess this one will be the 341st comment surely everything there is to be said about this film is already said in the 340 comments made before this one  therefore ill just try to somewhat summarize my own feelings about the movie and try to analyze a bit why it is so controversial dont worry  im not turning this to psychology lesson i am not a humanist  at least in that way that id study or practice psychology philosophy history etcfor me this movie seemed actually quite boring  there really wasnt really any story or plot which are essential to me because really  if there isnt a plot to a film then whats the point nothing its just a bunch of stuff that happens that they show to us  for no reason of course one might argue that the point of this film is to criticize the very human nature but so what we all know hopefully what it is and after taking that away from the movie  whats left nothing ok there is good acting but i think that good acting is a prerequisite for a good movie not something that would transform a hollow movie into a good oneits also a very linear movie practically everything the characters are thinking is laid out for you to see and as a result there are very few surprises and things that make you think  another reason why i thought it was boring since there is no room for your mind to wander this is how it is and thats final  sounds like a high school teacherok lets summarize is a disturbing but boring film the main reason that i thought it wasnt good is that there really is no story to tell what i think is the reason that so many people have praised it is that the the ideas are laid out very easily  its like disturbing pictures for dummies and as empirical tests have shown the majority of people are dummies ok i know im going to receive loads of hatemail for that one but even our old friend albert einstein said that in the universe there are only two things that are infinite the universe itself and humans capability to be ignorant and he wasnt even sure about the universe besides there are a lot of films that deal with similar disturbing subjects sex human behaviour with much more style and a good story such as dr strangelove clockwork orange twelve monkeys tokyo fist thesis braindead this one at least made me laugh 8mm audition and so on i think all those movies were better thanone thing i didnt say that the movie was all bad actually it was ok not excellent and a bit boring  thats all and also it could be and most probably in some of your opinion is that i simply didnt get it but i cant see how i could have missed it since in my own opinion i got all those movies i mentioned above and they all seem harder than this onethanks for your interest in my thoughts max,black_comedy
is one of my favorite films of all time i feel compelled to echo the sentiment of other viewers who have stated that this film is not for everyone and is certainly not suitable for childrenfamilies under any circumstances i love black humor and the comedy herein is as dark as it gets but it is dark comedy with a purpose there is satirical subtext at every turn it manages to get laughs out of taboo subject matter without ever feeling like it is mainly going for shock value a feat that ive rarely seen anyone else pull off ive seen at least 5 times and with each viewing i pick up on things id never noticed before the attention to detail is jawdropping every single plot element has purpose as does every line of dialogue i honestly believe that in the coming decades this film will be seen as a classic of sorts and if you can get past the heavy subject matter you will be highly rewarded for the time you invest in watching it its a masterpiece,black_comedy
isnt very happy its quite a lethargic viewing process at times but it achieves exactly what it sets out to achieve  a constant state of viewing irony todd solondz the directorwriter is all about pushing the viewers boundaries and comfort zonesdo you really love me no matter what a scene where bill maplewood asks his wife trish the very question we all ask our loved ones at some point his character is aware of the depraved nature of his being yet he functions as a good parent a respected member of society yet underneath he admits hes sick meanwhile his wife ironically thinks they have a perfect life and while trish lives a life of constant comparison to one sister who is a success story and another who is a failure her illness is one of gratification by this very daily contrasthelens character is one who has the admiration the success and attention of everybody yet shes still not happy to her own detriment as her selfcritical nature will not allow with a scene where she repeats to herself im zero im no good im nothing nothing then without a beat the phone rings giving her exactly what she wants allen describing exactly how she feels you are empty you are a zero you are a black holephilip seymour hoffmans character allen is a great example of how many men live their lives feeling like outsiders almost alien to beautiful women his character is one of considerable irony as he mentions early in the film see if she only knew how i felt deep down if i really cared for her respected her she would love me back is this line full of deep despair but more importantly irony as allen gratifies his sexual desires by cold calling random women speaking to them in degrading ways to satisfy his sexual needs yet he cant even say more than a hello in personeven joys character one of sadness and melancholy where nothing seems to go right for her seems to have been doomed right from the beginning for just having the name joy is a great movie overall a great cast and it serves as unique work of cinema as there arent many films like ithow do you feel at the end well unlike bills character after his dream you dont wake up happy feeling goodyou get very depressed because youre back living in reality,black_comedy
i dont know what to say about this movie it made me feel just about every human emotion a movie could possibly make me feel a lot of people will hate this movie for its brutal honesty and unbiased take on several touchy subjects but if you can look at this piece with a completely open mind and just let it flow you just might enjoy yourself take warning dear friend for dark waters lie ahead ps if you cant handle movies that are nothing but talking dont even try or maybe just bring a pillow this movie has long long long long long bits of almost casual conversation and these may put some folks to sleep,black_comedy
this 1998 independent film clearly can be called a film thats different strokes for different folks it looks at the lives in and out of different characters mostly it examines what makes them happy when it comes life relationships and intimate pleasure it centers around the struggle of three sisters first up is joyjane adamswhos just recently broke up with her boyfriend and now the only she can find is teaching and working at her various jobs then second is the hot and sexy author helenlara flynn boyle who just might be in for a strange bedfellow in a guy whos a stalker type showing his love with obscene phone callsa great and unknown role from the late philip seymour hoffman finally number three is trishc stevenson the rich housewife with a kid yet she has a secret monster for a husband a messed up shrinkdylan baker overall a film that explores the differences in intimate choice as the different and dark feelings of intimacy make many happy with satisfaction overall good character and thought study film,black_comedy
i just finished watching this film and as the ending hit i burst into laughter not because it was funny there is plenty of dark humor but because i was emotionally exhausted and didnt know what else to dothe way i can best describe what ive just witnessed is quietly vicious there is a surreal absurdity to it all and though i couldnt really identify with any of the characters its honesty and brutality will leave marks on me for days to comeexamines the cruel undercurrent beneath the thin veneer of everything is fine and follows the lives of a trio of sisters their parents and some surrounding characters the performances are nothing short of astounding as they chip away at their passiveaggressive suburban lives and the madness hidden thereinthis film pushes all kinds of boundaries and contains some of the most uncomfortable scenes ive ever laid eyes on it is not for the faint of heart or mindi dont want to say anything else because the less you know the better this film is i went in cold and it hit me like a ton of brickslove it or hate it i cant decide which its an experience that will stay with you,black_comedy
there arent a lot of movies that try to seriously portray depression and even fewer that do so well gets so much right its almost traumatic i found myself remembering lonely nights in the past that mixture of hatred and longing for the outside world the apparent monstrosity of happy people and the crippling selfdoubt that eventually turns you into the awful person youve already convinced yourself you areif theres one thread tying together this ensemble drama its mental illness and dysfunction and the perils of ignoring it all of the characters are ultimately incapable of understanding each others emotions and this blindness has monstrous consequences otherwise is somewhat disparate using the loose framing device of an extended family to tie together stories of various subjects and quality most interesting to me was philip seymour hoffman as an awkward introvert boiling over with rage that he can never express of course expressing your inner longings is not necessarily a good thing as with dylan bakers pedophile suburban dad the latter plot often feels overextended but bakers oddly sympathetic performance makes it ultimately riveting in a grotesque way other plots such as the jaunts down to a retirement community in florida are less interesting and as the film goes on more and more hacky stereotypes start to creep in with gerald harriss russian lothario being the biggest exampletodd solondz presents the whole thing with a sunny tvsitcom style that underscores both the horror and the ordinariness of what is going on he also gets some great performances out of his actors including the expected hoffman and baker and the lessexpected camryn manheim and jayne adams solondz is a provocateur sometimes to his detriment and is undoubtedly a film that tries to shock and scandalize its audience but its psychological understanding ultimately makes that shock more than a cheap thrill,black_comedy
is a story of three sisters joy trish and helen and weaves in characters who are a part their life joy is the angel the kindest albeit naive sister who is faced with harsh hurdle after hurdle a symbol of hope in a grim world trish is the housewife and loving mother to her children conceited yet kind at heart who glues the family together helen is the successful artist independent successful condescending while deceptively confident we also get a sexually frustrated psychiatrist lonely geek who makes obscene phone calls a wornout old couple and more the films ensemble cast are sublime hilarious and reflect people we all know or think we know featuring a smorgasbord of nuanced and memorable characters dylan baker steals the show as bill maplewood a psychiatrist with grotesque fantasies who society would unquestionably label a monster his performance gets under your skin and lingers in your mind days after watching what makes him so memorable is that despite his appalling and unforgivable acts he is remarkably sympathetic honest and far beyond what couldve easily been just a cruel and heartless caricature explores themes of rape pedophilia loneliness belonging and sexuality with a dynamite script that is funny morbid moving and drenched in subtext solondz uses a unique voice to convey how society uses sex and fantasy to fill certain life voids and strive to create their version of the film is perhaps one of the darkest blackcomedies ever and deals with similar ideas and characters found in american beauty only grittier and unflinching my only flaws with the film are its its length and overindulgence this narrative where a handful of characters link up as the story moves forward is comparable to movies like magnolia crash pulp fiction rat race etc while the style is ambitious it becomes problematic as the plot loses focus punch and is usually overwrought pulp fiction is probably the sharpest meshcharacter movie ive seen because it focuses on fewer characters falls into the trap of being too ambitious when the threesisters marriagetorn parents get introduced their story felt superfluous and lacked the meat exploration and commentary found in the other arcs i still give a 9 because todd solondz magnum opus is a brave memorable movie with heart hilarity and vigor there arent many filmmakers audacious enough to go there without being pure shockvalue makes thickskinned audiences squeamish but it resonates with you for days like many films dont and is a must see if you can handle the subject matter,black_comedy
whenever im not 100 sure i have ways of telling whether or not i liked a particular movie if i find myself on imdb following the watching of said movie reading message board posts and seeing what others had to say about it thats a good sign if i find myself retelling the plot in detail to my wife thats also a good sign both of these signs were fulfilled following the watching of and after going through an entire day not really knowing whether to accept or reject this film i watched it last night i think ive finally decided i think its a really great movie despite some really appalling and disgusting subject matter you see thats not really easy for me to admit because id seen once before and in fact i used to own on dvd a blind buy purely because philip seymour hoffman was a part of the cast  i used to love that guystill do it sat on my dvd shelf for years and when i finally broke down and gave it a watch i hated it im pretty sure i didnt waste any time selling it away and figured id never watch it again well apparently i didnt know about the book then and when the book came along i realized id have to give it one more go around i think that pretty much brings us up to speed on where i stand with this movie this time i had absolutely no problem sitting through this over two hour movie which felt more like fortyfive minutes solondz used his time very wisely and didnt take a second of his film for granted cramming in something essential during every sceneits a controversial piece theres no denying that its a film that will certainly leave your casual movie goer with a dropped jaw and probably turn off a lot of people i wont deny that there were times during the picture where i felt dirty and disgusting for even watching it and even more so for enjoying it certainly im for the most part talking about the storyline involving dylan baker however the film in a way redeems itself for giving us a few happy moments moments of closure and letting us know that at least these characters recognize their wrongdoing which is more than we get in real life sometimes the short scene where bill maplewood turns to his half sleeping wife in bed and tells her that hes sick not referring to a virus he may have picked up but rather that hes sick for being a pedophile hes sobbing at the time and really i thought that was a brilliant inclusion and i wonder what i wouldve thought of that storyline if that scene had been omitted theres another nice scene where allen finally realizes that the girls he calls on the phone and more notably helen are never going to accept him or find him appealing and that his other neighbor kristina will so he goes to her apartment and lies down with her allen on top of the blankets she underneath its a nod to the fact that neither of them really like the physical act of sex allen gets off on being distanced from his objects of desire his penchant for using the phone and kristina has been raped so neither will she find sex an appealing activity theyre perfect for each other  awkward and perfectso as much as people want to condemn todd solondz for making id rather applaud him why because these sorts of people do exist who knows what goes on when people lock their doors and pull their curtains at night people have all sorts of perversions and turn ons whether youre a doctor living in the burbs or a regular guy living in an apartment some of our turn ons are fairly run of the mill but behind a lot of locked doors there are a real sickos pedophiles rapists and the like and then theres guys like allen a little odd but for the most part harmless so thank you todd solondz for not shying away from this sort of subject matter and facing it and even more so for being able to find a little humor in it and even more so for adding those few classy touches in a film that really has no place being classy for people who say they dont like this movie but secretly do i understand for people who say they dont like this movie and mean it i dont understand ill certainly never bash anyones personal opinion but i do apologize if youre offended by i apologize if every film cant be roses  puppy dogs and i apologize that as long as there are directors like todd solondz there will be filmmakers who arent afraid to grab reality by the horns and show us whats really going onrating 810,black_comedy
we follow the lives of three sisters living in new jersey joy a naive unsuccessful songwriter helen a selfdestructive poet and trish a housewife married to a prominent psychologist i have heard this referred to as solondz best and i agree with that he once again confronts social problemsand once again focusing on suburbia including relationshipsexual troubles and the controversy of this holding perversionpedophilia and rape explicit dialog disgusting visuals being nihilisticthere is no good or bad objectively speaking its all subtle shades of grey with that said this doesnt glorify the negative stuff that happens and being ironic in its tone has left it rather divisive is this brilliant or tasteless well if it cant be both then every viewer has to decide for themselves regardless of if you wind up hating it or notit is not for everyone and you arent dumb if you dont like it i would like to remind you that problems that go unexplored remain unsolved this doesnt claim to know how to better thingsand i can understand why some complain about this and yet this isnt depressing honestly i couldnt take my eyes off it for the 130 minute running time yes it is raw the leads go through a ton of cruelty the ending doesnt follow up on everything but it is also humane it has smoothly delivered exposition and development of the entirely psychologically credible and wellrounded charactersgranted most of them are selfish in fact perhaps all of them are really and we see people wont accept the harsh truth todds complimentary spoilt brat etc so much is said with few words it is funny at timessome will laugh a lot at it the acting is excellent and it is realistic everyone in this is searching for and none find it the pace is gradual scenes that display awkward situations feel like they take forever just like in real life this uses long takes and not that many closeups it shows what happens more than it enhances it in editing i recommend this to anyone open to it and mature enough to deal with itno one not at least in their teen years 810,black_comedy
before i started watching i thought it would be just another regular drama about finding meaning of lifeat first i did not have some high expectations but further the film developed i realized this movie is like nothing i have ever watchedmovie does not try to embellish life it shows it exactly how it isand for some people it is pretty fcked upfor example i could take that fat guy allen which entire life is based on jerking off and fantasizing to have sex with his next door neighbor or maybe that depressed kid who just wants to come and openly talks about it with his pedophile dadthat very last conversation they had was one of the most heartbreaking scenes i ever saw in a movieit makes you feel sorry for both characters although you know what kind of sick things his father has doneis a very well acted moviewith great story developing and its dark sense of humor makes it even betterwellat least for me that isa beautiful portrait of modern society with variety of characters that are so different and yet so alike,black_comedy
1998a slightly surreal and unhappy movie a dark comedy and overall intriguingimagine a mixture of really believable everyday people a doctor and his family doing things like eating supper and talking about sweet things before bedtime or a man working at his desk who talks casually to a neighbor across the hall but mix in a layer of imagined dreamt and real we assume sexual and violent deviance of the worst kind we dont see the crimes and they are crimes but we hear about them and we see the sadness that ensuesthe clash of moods as people casually deal with heinous acts is both humorous and sickening depending on who you are i suppose its not a bad angle for a movie todd solondz directs with a very careful and consistent touch and with some stellar acting by jane adams philip seymour hoffman and jon lovitz we end up in some pretty interesting territorywhy does it leave us flat by the end im not sure partly pace some of the jarring aspects early on become familiar by the end partly disbelief the way we learn of the worst crimes is a little stretched and though comedies and farces are allowed to stretch things it comes off stretched thin at times at other times it has a perfect pitch and we are really curious curious being a better word than enthralled or moved its a weirdly intellectual movie with all the emotive stuff going on but a unique one and well made,black_comedy
this is a very messed up movie and the script is very la about midway through the movie i realized they were trying to pretend they were new jersey inhabitants facepalm for that fail if you ignore that stupid detail the movie is a number of different stories tied to together by one dinner tablefamily in search of in relationships but since they are so very very messed up in the head they tend to attract what they aresome of the thematic elements are going to sicken or disturb sensitive viewers so dont watch it if you are easily offended theres nothing visually graphic but the topics are a bit ickyi especially enjoyed jon lovitzs speech at the restaurant that was pretty epic this is a drama not an action flick and its not a good date movie since it covers the failure of relationships,black_comedy
this is a verbally graphic movie not for everyone interesting and very well acted yet somewhat flat i normally like odd and demented humor but this one was more disturbing than funny perhaps if the story of the shrinkrapist was removed i my have responded bettervery dark and depressing dont get me wrong there were definitely some truly funny parts each actoractress did a great job of playing their parts to the t i worry about the kid in the movie and if filming some of those scenes scarred him for life the opening scene with jon lovitz is pretty harsh yet funny i think my favorite character was that of allen played by phillip seymorehoffman i may have spelled that wrong no matter what that man plays he seems to take on a completely different persona he is a great actor ive never been a big fan of lara flynnboyle but she does an ok job in the film watch this movie but watch it alone or with someone you think can handle it,black_comedy
has gotten a lot of press  i guess if putting up a dull series of the most shocking things a person can imagine constitutes good filmmaking then is a grand success  personally i didnt believe a single character in the film was real in any way shape or form  solondz seems to believe that if hes shocking and disturbing even though completely contrived he somehow will come off as an independent originaland it seems as if he is succeeding because everyone seems to be buying it  contrived situations paper thin characters and a deathly slow pace add up to only one thing in my booka poor movie,black_comedy
definitely a hit of the nineties this film pulls out all the stops for shocking its audience without showing any gratuitous violence and fully deserves the critical acclaim it has received after winning the cannes film festival in 1998is a real life story about the lives of several members of the community including bill a therapist in therapy himself ironically enough allen a dataresources employee struggling with self esteem and approaching the apple of his eye troubled writer helen who seems to spend the film searching for authenticity to her books helens family are parallel to the storyline as they each seem to have their own unique storyline except sister trish who is married to bill with 3 children and lying within or is it because we all know that a relationship cant function properly when people keep secrets from one anotherthe central characters in this film seem to be the ones with the biggest problems throughout we search for search for a hardened protagonist but fail to idealise with the purer characters the characters we tend to associate to are the darker more intense characters sticking closely by their side as we become more and more deeply involved in their troubled psyche the lighter characters invent little room for relief with an explosive amount of sex murder frustration and batterythe film focuses around issues which some people have to deal with throughout life although these are sometimes portrayed in a humorous way the film admits itself to very little outcry of laughter the black comedy causes us to see the film as funny but accept this humour as at its most heavy introverted and ironic caused by typical flaws of hard hitting stereotypical behaviour topics that are often avoided within the film industry and even life no longer lie dormant in this masterpiece the film deals with such issues as rape paedophilia and sexual perversion concentrating on creating a sense a fusion between the audience and the perpetrators of these usually senselessly horrific offencesthere are a lot of things i could say about but to sum up its a master crafted piece of pure magnificence i would recommend this to anyone mature enough to cope with the very real issues involved mind you the subject matter is not for all and carries a burden for those not open to sexual obscenityoverall i give a classic and i must say well earned5 out of 5,black_comedy
i was out of the country when this film was released and have only just discovered it on video  i havent been so satisfied and disturbed by a film since i saw requiem for a dream  this is what american beauty wanted to be only that film didnt go nearly far enough  and guess what  it won oscars  is pure genius and truly gets to the rotten core of human relationships whereas the aforementioned film scratched the surface and then backed off one eye on the awards programs  one film told an obvious story american society is superficial and people are lonely  duh the other film this one of course is a universal story of alienation and truly dysfunctional families and individuals  it doesnt pull any punches and if youre like me youll be grateful that a filmmaker had the guts to tell this story,black_comedy
is a wonderfully crass and dirty movie you feel guilty for laughing try to look away are determined to disapprove but all the while you just cant get enough and the last 30 seconds are pure gold,black_comedy
oh my god this movie was awful i guess im not the film connoisseur i thought i was the first scene was great a fractured realistic scene of modern day dating however after that it just turned into every other self indulgent sex comedy ive ever seen drawing upon such great laughs as pedophilia ha and gay rape haha  the characters were paper thin the jokes were raunchy the conclusion was laughable in the bad way all in all a very very poor film i expected much better it didnt tell me anything about the human condition other than if your not getting laid you arent happy but then if you do get laid you still arent happy it has shock value but so does jerry springer and thats free i want my 3 dollars back dreadful film,black_comedy
i give todd solondz an awful lot of credit for this movie in it he puts some incredibly powerful and sensitive issues at work and he does so without ever giving in or copping out and there is a lot of powerful stuff in this movie for this he gets a lot of credit this is very much an ensemble piece which weaves in and out of various different storylines all of which do shed light into the personalities of the different characters each of the actors do a very good job with their roles especially dylan baker who played bill maplewood in both of these manners this is a remarkable movieunfortunately this is not a remarkable movie for a few different reasons its not a great looking movie but thats not a huge problem just doesnt seem to come together it just kind of sits there unable to pull together all of its different threads into one remarkable whole as such misses the mark  and all thats left is a few remarkably powerful sequences like when bill talks to his son about the incidents that dont really become anything truly great,black_comedy
this is a horrible distasteful hilarious and brilliant film a movie that has the modus operandi of displaying sexual frustration through deviancy will certainly alienate the vast majority of audiences no matter how well it does its job and lets make this clear it does its job and it does it almost too well as i had to watch it several times to stand getting to the end its amazing but dont feel bad if you cant stomach it,black_comedy
starts very well in that it sets up its characters solidly and ends really really really bad because it makes no point whatsoever whats even worse is that it tries to trick you into thinking that its a movie to be taken seriously because everybodys a sex addict and everybodys miserable and everybody throws up in case you didnt get it the title is used for its opposite meaning what saves this pretentious movie from is essentially its great cast especially that little boy whose father is a pedophile he essentially played an un pitchable child role what an impressive and mature performancethe first forty minutes or so are very interesting in terms of character evolution but theres no use for you to look at your watch because these are only forty minutes out of one hundred and forty minutes worth of very very very pointless controversy wrapped in very very very unaesthetic cinematography long story short this is a movie where very promising satire and sarcasm is dumped for explicit material as a matter of fact everything that the characters do seems to be for shock value the grandfather who pours tons of salt on his plate despite his doctors recommendations no need to shoot further scenes to elaborate of course the neighbour who phoneharrasses women and ends up drunk and pukes everywhere the little boy who after six laborious months finally shoots his cum has his dog eat it and joyfully tells his entire family that he had an orgasm pleaseyes a scene like the one where a father suggests demonstrating masturbation to his son will surprise you shock you make you smile make you laugh offend you make you applaud the writer for his unapologetic manners but once youre past the effect will leave no room for you to reflect in any way for the simple reason that theres nothing to reflect about since everythings done for the sake of spontaneous disgust andor offence if you want good sarcasm taboo topics and impeccable cinematography check out sitcom by franois ozon where a mother decides to sleep with her gay son to cure him from his homosexuality it has an irresistibly witty and sarcastic dialogue an asset that crucially lacks when you want to be honest with people with topics as delicate as pedophilia you need something to counterbalance it pasolini shot the most shocking sexual scenes in history but he had the most poetic cinematography and sound track to back it up with it is one thing to push peoples buttons to make them reflect on something and a totally different thing to go for shock value is not the former,black_comedy
joy jordan jane adams and andy kornbluth jon lovitz are a sad couple on a really bad date he berates her mercilessly allen philip seymour hoffman is a pervert and his psychiatrist bill maplewood dylan baker cares little for his fantasies helen jordan lara flynn boyle is a lonely successful author whose neighbor allen makes obscene phone calls trish maplewood cynthia stevenson is the oldest jordan sister and married to bill maplewood shes bossy to her youngest sister joy she has 3 children but she doesnt know that her husband has disturbing thoughts and they have a sexless marriage the jordan sisters parents mona louise lasser and lenny ben gazzara are separating after 40 years of marriage and thats not to mention the disturbing things that bill maplewood gets up tothis is a mass of unhappy people the title is a bit of a joke everybody is damaged they do disturbing things they hurt each other mostly they are their own worst enemy its not funny its not lovable i have no wish to spend any time with any of them it is a disappointing turn from writerdirector todd solondz who made welcome to the dollhouse i actually like the character in that movie i find no in wallowing in this tale of human misery,black_comedy
even the acting in this movie was sub par the successful writer the third sister was the worst actor ive seen in a whilenot only was the movie downright perverted but it dragged on a bit and was plain uninteresting at some moments also the way the characters are interwoven is quite thin and hard to imagine a pedophile who is also a loving father and also a supposedly goo therapistthere is too much drama happening with too many different people and the girl who constantly feels sorry for herself just makes me feel sorry for watching this movieim sure its a one of a kind movie not meant to appeal to a larger base of people but the only reason i bought it was because i thought it was going to be a great movie to watch but one most people choose not to watch,black_comedy
if youve seen the trailer for this movie you would think that this is the story of three sisters in new jersey and their wacky adventures in love and romance   instead its a brutal depiction of sexual criminals where the bystanders are apparently so superficial that rape and murder dont even dent their lives two people in the theater where i saw this were determined to believe it was a comedy and chuckled throughout the scenes of a paedophile stalking his prey awful,black_comedy
i am glad i saw this movie because it was worth buying it without actually having watching it first dylan baker was brilliant in this movie i dont think any other actor could have pulled off bill maplewoods role any better than dylan did this movie was a bit disturbing in some parts however it was also shockingly funny great movie i really recommend it however for mature audiences only,black_comedy
this is supposed to be a dark comedy but quite frankly made me sick i have a strong stomach love violence and porn but the thoughts of child abuse and the sickening way in which it is treated in this film is disgusting you are left with an empty feeling after watching this and while it is thoughtprovoking it is definitely not for kids or anyone who has ever been the victim of abuse,black_comedy
this should have been todd solondzs first film not his 4th how could he go directly from the sophisticated retardbrilliance of welcome to the dollhouse to this seems like something a talented but very immature high school boy wroteall shock value wallowing in obvious ironies and then copping out with even more obvious plot payoffs in the end is just a lame retread of stylistic and thematic territory already run into the ground by better films like magnolia and shortcutsexcept with lots more masturbation,black_comedy
a few years back i lived in a housing project where one night my nextdoor neighbors had a fight  the police were summoned and when my neighbor explained the incident to me he told me he asked the police this question  do i look like a wifebeater  indeed what does a wifebeater look like  what does a murderer look like  or a pedophile or a drugdealing gangster  has been described as a deeply disturbing movie mainly because of its content  its about people who do some pretty terrible things  but i dont think that this adequately describes why it is at times difficult to watch  i think that the alleged problem lies elsewhere  it does such a great job of unmasking peoples selfdelusions  the murderer or pedophile or gangster or wifebeater isnt some unknown strange person out there its your nextdoorneighbor or someone in your family or you  it really challenges our notions of normalcy  everyone in the movie appears to be normal  and thats why it works so very well  solondz does a fabulous job of releasing information about the main characters a little at a time until by the end of the movie each layer of the onion has been completely removed  the outer shell looks so happy so beautiful while the inner core looks like a substitute for dantes innermost circle of hell  the main characters the entire jordan family suffer from an inability to be intimate which requires vulnerability honesty and trust  they all suffer from this debilitating malaise because theyre all unable to be honest with themselves about their shameful secrets  and as in real life the type of people theyre attracted to and attract to themselves are also deeply disconnected both from themselves and from others isnt an easy movie to watch  but its a film of profound psychological insight and depth  i cant imagine anyone not benefiting from it,black_comedy
i consider myself a lover of bad taste such issues as ejaculation masturbation or any form of sex can usually be generated into something funny films like theres something about mary american pie and even one hilarious scene in 1994s serial mom was just laugh out loud funnyunfortuanately i cannot say the same for this movie painfully boring blatantly stupid and some of the worst underwritten characters i have ever seenim sorry but a grown man talking to his kid about having sex with a little boy is just not funny how can someone laugh about this i know children who have been sexually molested before and its just not funny even if the characters would have played the scene in an outrageous stunt it still wouldnt have been funnyavoid this film it is one of the worst movies i have ever ever had to endure slow dumb stupid moronic ignorant and not even worthy as a paperweightit just plain bites,black_comedy
this movie has left a very bad taste in my mouth i give this one a 2 out of 10 only because a 1 is reserved for those made for tv movies that you see on usascifi channels,black_comedy
was not without some redeeming features many scenes were genuinely hysterical but overall i found it to be disturbing dangerous and downright pointless i wanted to vomit when the final scene between the father and son took place and the last scene of the movie with the son and the dog on the balcony showed for what it truly isa jim carrey movie with good press it really bothers me that this movie is in video stores across the country for anyone to see im sure most of you will think im a conservative prude but thats not the case i was watching john waters movies in high school they were shocking yes but obviously satirical and downright hilarious john waters had skill this movie could have been made by a 16 year old,black_comedy
i like todd solondz i liked welcome to the dollhouse i liked this movie but i felt that some parts were a little too downanddirty the conversations between dr maplewood and his son particularly the final one would a child really ask these questions the final scene with billy on the deck and the dog unnecessary if there was something trying to be said with that scene i would like to know what it is i didnt see any point to it the movie was a little long i could have done with about 15 minutes less i liked the seamy underbelly of the suburban life kind of thing and the way everyone thinks they are a loser whether they are or not this film touched on so many taboo subjects and that is something i can appreciate all in all i did like it and i would recommend it but it went a bit overboard for me and i consider myself extremely openminded the resolutions left me a little empty also,black_comedy
each story is a thread and these threads need to be woven together to make the story clear  was not woven it was tangled too little thought was given to each story and the relationship of that story to the others  if one sister had been centered and all the other stories fitted to hers this could have been great  instead we got a mishmash of fathermothersisterhusbandsistercareersisterlosthusbandpedophiliaand so on until the story of the doorman somehow wandered into the mess  less would have been more hws,black_comedy
is quite possibly the most disturbing film i have ever seen and i am not someone who is easily disturbed  of course that is not in and of itself a particularly compelling reason to spend two hours and fifteen minutes watching a movie  why then could i not change the channel when i caught it on hbothe short answer to the preceding question is that is mesmerizing the profundity of the perversion involved and patheticness of every single character evoke a greater emotional reaction in the viewer than any formulaic hollywood yawnfest ever could  beyond that i feel somewhat uncomfortable discussing the films merits  most ofs central themes go unarticulated in the film itself and it seems somewhat trite to try articulating them herei should add that i was somewhat surprised by how positive a reaction has received amongst imdb reviewers  certainly this movie is not for everyone  sexual deviance bleakness and frustration are all too pervasive in our culture  however this does not make for entertaining viewing and those who tend to prefer escapist cinema to the more realistic or something fare would do well to avoid  that said the film has a great deal to offer the more adventurous viewer and is definitely worth checking out when in the right sort of mood though i must say im not quite certain as to what that mood is710,black_comedy
ive always found the use of children in adult material distasteful and this is a particularly pernicious example how in all conscience solandz thought it appropriate that kids should be put through the excrutiating and emetic scenes they were subjected to is extraordinary film makers have their heads so far stuck up their own arses that they would find it inexplicable that any one should question their integrity in the matter the important thing is bringing their great works to the screen at any cost to the innocent as long as their parents approve its all kosher and above board deep down though i think a lot of film makers are just sadistic and want to drag us down to wallow in their psychic st having the dog lick the boys come and then have the dog lick the mothers mouth is a perfect example inside the dollhouse had a plot credibility problem and likewise here the confession scene with the father and son was implausible in dialogue and typically repellenta lot of lost actors turned up to appear in todds opus like louise lassiter and ben gazzara how refreshing for them to get back to some real cinema again cutting edge stuff about the alleged human condition and all that gazzara plays a man who feels nothing anymore which doesnt fully explain his odd past caringam i still alive performance the opening scene in the restaurant fails to convince but sets the tone and attitude to life of the rest of this pompously slow filmsolandz obviously has a deep seated need to portray this material i think he is a glib superficial and talentless film maker,black_comedy
very well made film but this is one of only two films ive ever seen that really crossed the line for me  the fatherson plot went too far for me to enjoy watching  i couldnt stop thinking about the young actor especially during their scene together near the endloved the rest of the film but still i really wish i hadnt seen it,black_comedy
secrets are revealed and devastating truths are brought to the surface in tod solondzs the movie is some kind of cross between wallen and short cuts peppered with sexual perversion the result is a dark and absorbing watchwhen i saw a woman at my side cried throughout the movie as for me i was completely indifferent i missed a subtle and sensitive direction to bring that depth and humanity to the story nevertheless there is still much to enjoy,black_comedy
while it is hard to credit any of the technical virtues of this film the overall portrayal of these sexually dysfunctional portrayals came off to me as meanspirited and priggish too often solondz undercuts his scenes with cheaply ironic 70s pop love songs air supply etc to keep the audience from identifying with them  the constant backandforth between bitterly dark comedy and hyperrealistic portrayal prevented real insight and instead encouraged an almost snide voyeristic amusementon the other hand this film is to be applauded for attempting to deal with subject matter i didnt get the feeling that solondz personally views his characters as spiteful or pathetic but instead that he wanted to lighten the burden on the audience by creating ironic distance if he can keep the same very high level of acting and writing in his next film without relying on cheap irony hell produce a film which is hard to ignore,black_comedy
im a movie goer for some years now unfortunately i didnt catch this one back when it came out i guess i wasnt such a movie goer as i am now anyway ive read high praises for this movie for a while and ive ever read this movies title in other movies synopses as inspirational or as term of comparisonso when i saw it for rental i grabbed iti really dont remember what was the last time i wasted so many minutes of my life anyway this movie is my latest and probably all time record complete waste of time this movie has no purpose whatsoever the stories told in it are rather uninspired and uninteresting theres one or two details that made me laugh or appreciate it but all in all this movie doesnt worth a minute of attention my attention at least im not easily shocked or have any problems with heavy themed movies but this one is i repeat a waste of timeseeing this movie didnt contribute whatsoever for my life i didnt take nothing useful out of it not even entertainment or appreciation for the cinematography nothing sure there are a lot of unhappy people a lot of disturbed people and a lot of problematic people thats what i got from the movie as if i didnt know that alreadythumbs down,black_comedy
summarizes almost everything wrong with independent films these days it is a sensationalistic bottom dweller so smug and selfconfident as it fires pointblank salvo after salvo at the broadest barnside in the world the american dream solondz manages to create his own special brand of irony that is entirely devoid of subtlety or wit all hes left with is meanness a meanness that doesnt connect to life in any constructive or thoughtful way but the thing that truly makes this film unwatchable is the pace each scene is played out just like the next as disappointments and bad decisions and empty pronouncements all build to an incredibly predictable conclusion where each character resorts to internalizing their psychoses and remains right where they were at the beginning there is no intriguing dramatic progress in any of the storylines or insight given into these pseudocharacters all because of solondz refusal to let any light or sensitivity into their world,black_comedy
is nothing but cheap indie shock porn a hollow impotent pink flamingos wannabe that chooses easy subjects of provocation to just appease expendable income chic cinemasochists and leaves the more human among us asking why peoples time and money was wasted on this spiteful one note effort most insultingly it has the nerve to ask us to care for its squirm suburban paranoia caricatures whilst simultaneously breaking out the farley brothers level of gross out humour every opportunity it can insincerity is the most evident sign of amateurism in a storyteller and this adolescent effort is the most blatant example ive ever come across in film worse than nonaction insincerity or a lack of moral stance is the bane of independent filmmaking more often than not its not an effort towards greater truth but rather one towards covering up an immature or trivial concept or a weak surface value vision which is what we have here todd solondz aims just to cause his audience pain and even if he had higher aspirations they definitely are not evident on screen and if laughing at other peoples misery is your idea of the epitome of cinema well you are beyond help and your fabricated soul has no place being anywhere near a film screen your kind will have your time soon and it will be a spacious lengthy dark time admittedly i should check out more from the wasteful decade of american independent cinema that spawned this fauxintellectual piece of inhumanity before i say anything too concrete god forbid but for now ill just say bluntly that this film and its defendants can go to hell despite them not being flammable what with all the fibre glass and all,black_comedy
ha ha ha daddy raped juniors friend who wakes up in the morning pooping blood isnt that funny i didnt think so i can enjoy very dark humor i can laugh about things that others find offensive so it takes something really obscene to turn my stomach this was not done in a satirical way it looked dead serious but somehow you knew they wanted you to laugh which made it even more disturbing for me anyway if you arent disturbed by pedophilia themes of children reaching their masturbation goals depressed overweight and otherwise unhappy individuals and in fact you find all of those topics very funny this may be just the movie for you the actors were very talented and certainly convincing in their roles the director made it all seem very real enjoy,black_comedy
if i had to say something positive about it would be that its different from most other movies ive ever seen and that it had a few surreal moments that were quite funny and yet disturbing at the same time however it is far from consistent and in general being different doesnt constitute a good movie in my eyesis more like a series of unrelated sketches than an attempt at a cohesive meaningful film some of the sketches were kinda funny some were oddly dramatic but ultimately they didnt seem to go anywhere and it actually felt like the director wanted it that way other than perhaps a common tone or style most of the scenes appear to exist almost in complete separation from the rest of the movie and hence add little or nothing to it as a whole more simply put is just too longin terms of entertainment value is far too slow paced for me to recommend in terms of deeper meaning seems to be more interested in getting a reaction possibly negative out of its audience than being thought provoking or achieving any kind of point if you want to see a movie that confronts the darker side of human nature in particular pedophilia then see fritz langs classic m instead otherwise if you want to see a very long confusing series of quite unrelated scenes a small proportion of which are fairly funny then see,black_comedy
when i started watching this movie i knew it wasnt my type of movie but i was drawn to it like someone would be drawn to a car wreck however instead of being physically gory its emotionally gory i kept watching to see who else was hiding a bizarre aspect of themselves and to see what happened as a result of it i would definitely keep all children away from this film as it is no holds barred when it comes to sick sexual behavior and conversation yes the acting was very good but sometimes i wish those talents would be used in a more positive way one of the other reviewers mentioned that the film did not show the consequences of the psychiatristpedophile who raped young boys i agree that was not the most responsible filmmaking id also like to point out that we seem to be led to almost sympathize with the creep i felt very sad for his son and the boys who were victims more than anyone least of all the perpetrator almost everyones behavior was sick to some degree going all the way from extreme phoniness and arrogance to murder i walked away from this film wondering how many people in real life are hiding something emotionally gory about themselves and i also walked away a little more disillusioned with the world we now live in im guessing i should have skipped this one since my speed is more mrs doubtfire and its a wonderful life,black_comedy
i thought that this film was tremendous although the humour was blacker than black there was a strong note of mockery  note the use of the musical score  beautiful music contrasting with sordid behaviour  the masturbation of a telephone sexpest set to a lovely operatic piece and an upbeat flute introduction to scenes involving the pederasts familya daring piece of cinema that im sure would be difficult for some people to takewe should welcome it when somebody dares us to step outside our comfort zonethe film certainly introduces us to some gruesome monsters  the two elder sisters trish and helen gloating over their younger sisters failures in the guise of sisterly concern of coursesticks in my mind its almost as repulsive as the actions of trishs perverted husband  you feel that they deserve each otherfull marks to todd solondz for an unique piece of work walt disney it certainly wasnt  but all the better for it,black_comedy
todd solondz has one goal with this film and that is to show the dark side of the average middleclass community where everything seems to be in perfect order solondz apparently has a very small range of cinematic creativity because he has only one way of trying to make people laugh show as many tragic miserable fat sad and lonely people as possible and hope that the audience will mistake it as black humour the irritating irony that mr solondz insists on pouring over every single scene ruins the potential of this film as it all gets incredibly predictable there is one good scene in this film and that is the final scene of the inceststory it is stunning and it shows what this movie could have been like apart from that this movie is just bad pure and simple,black_comedy
i saw this film and i was really shocked the film has nothing to do with the trailer when you see the trailer you think that it could be a really funny film but the film is completely different i only found it perverted,black_comedy
is the only movie ive ever seen that i can honestly say offended me  in the year of black comedies the slums of beverly hills and the overlyapplauded theres something about mary for example this one takes the prize for the blackest of them all  todd solondzs attempts to push buttons succeed at every turn and many viewers in the theater with me watched with their hand partially over their eyes ready to block out the more outrageous sights  is child molestation funny  do unnecessary closeups of semen make you giggle  do desperate pitiful unattractive deviants make for good comedy  if you say yes then go see  as for this reviewer i went straight home and took a shower immediately after viewing trying in vain to wash the experience from my memory,black_comedy
you know that feeling when you regret having watched a film because it was dead boring and a total waste of time  that is what you will get from this film  i wanted to give it a 2 but ended on a 3 because the movie has some moments that are not quite as dull as the rest of the moviein short very tediousi can see how some people would rate it differently eg lovers of woody allens works,black_comedy
i dont know  i just didnt get the film  i really loved welcome to the dollhouse some parts of it brought me close to tears  but this one where was it coming from  was i supposed to laugh i had heard its a comedy i guess part of the reason for the film was to make me feel uncomfortable and to that extent it worked  i felt uncomfortable watching parts of this and thats not the reason i watch films  and its the tone and not the subject matter im complaining about  for example henry portrait of a serial killer is an uncomfortable subject and not an easy movie to watch but i loved it and was entertained from beginning to end  i had high expectations for this film but was disappointed  i gave it a three rating because i did manage to not turn the video off,black_comedy
not for everyone dark comedy better than american beauty or magnolia etc etc ad nauseam  did i watch the same version of this film as some of the other reviewers here one comes away from enduring the final moments of viewing this sick flick with an absolute sense of bewilderment that the credits include so many accomplices  surely there are enough psychopathology courses in american universities to have spread the word by now that such banal treatment of common mental illnesses like those portrayed here is less art than slapstickit is not enough i think to remark  as so many reviewers here have done  that this film is good because it deals with taboo subjects in an open and ironic manner  successful dark comedy requires more than that it needs a dramatic raison detre as well as a conscience  has neither it moves like treacle from one blank stare to another  it attempts to involve the unsuspecting viewer as a coconspirator in one krafftebbing scenario after another  it is as base and loathsome as the pornographic images it conjures  but disingenuously avoids  in the viewers mindmoreover the dialogue seems carefully crafted to appeal not to the kind of sophisticated audience who might just might find some truly redeeming moments of cleverness or originality but to children in that respect it insults the intelligence as well as the sensitivity of any discerning and mature adult  i detest that kind of manipulation  it is commercially exploitative  it is thirdrate shtick  what a waste of talent by so many otherwise competent actorstoo bad the ratings numbers do not include a zero,black_comedy
 an all time low in scraping the barrel stunning in its complete lack of morals taste or decency amazing considering it starred the likes of philip seymour hoffmann and lara flynn boyle in fairness their acting was quite incredible considering the subject matter involved an unnecessary movie  a complete and utter waste of time for everyone involved including us viewers of course the critics loved it back in 1998 or thereabouts i think but i am glad to say the sicko style of director  writer todd solondz has been given precious little opportunity for his weird tastes to hit the screen since an extremely rare occasion for me to say i will be returning this to the 2nd hand shop i bought it in as i would not allow it to remain in my collection plot spoilers follow   i apologise for using the word plot as its really a false description considering there is no plot to speak of do yourself a favour read them so you can avoid the mistake i madeeverything but some of the lowlights include  relationship break ups leading to suicide kids being unrepentantly molested and worse very graphic conversations between adults and kids  i know its a movie script  doesnt make it ok an exploitative author who wishes she was raped so she could write about it obscene phone calls to random women and neighbours eg above mentioned writer someone is murdered and body disposed of little bits of a time in plastic bagsall the while the characters are either loudly proclaiming they are blissfully content or totally useless while early on in the film there were some darkly comic moments which is why i watched it to a conclusion overall it was one of the worst movies i have ever had the displeasure to watch thankfully i am not alone in this view as per multiple reviews on here already,black_comedy
is an attempt to depict the stories of several dysfunctional individuals most notably the three jordan sisters with a touch of humorthe result is mixed at best offensive at worst  there are a few chuckles as the story winds its way slowly through the lives of the jordan sistersthe problem with this movie is that everyone is dysfunctional but nobody has any redeeming qualities  in the end you dont care about any of the characters because you cant build any sympathy for the two dimensional deviantsoh and on top of that there is great deal of unnecessary and graphic depictions of human biological functions that serve little to no symbolic or story telling value  remember this future directors less is morein short if you think you want to see this movie watch american beauty instead,black_comedy
from the start i hated this movie and didnt understand why a movie like this had to be made i resented wasting 30 minutes of my life watching it thats all i could stand found it in the 1001 movies you must see before you die so i thought it would be phenomenal whoever put it in that book must have been bribed didnt get it dont want to get it i put myself in the shoes of the woman in the restaurant politely trying to tell the loser jon lovitz she no longer wanted to see him and he flaked out on her i could imagine having a date like this and it made me anxious even watching this first scene then philip seymour hoffman telling how he wanted to brutalize some woman excuse me sorry this movie was totally trashy,black_comedy
there have been few films which ive really felt the need to write about afterwards this is certainly one of themim not uptight nor do i feel that a film necessarily has to be upbeat or enlightening  and this film is certainly neither but there is something about this film which is extremely unsettling and not just for its supremely dark subjectmatter on the other hand a day after watching it for the first time i cannot stop thinking about it perhaps that is the reason why i am so troubled by this film it is infectious and the virus it carries is one of unabated bleakness and hopelessnessat this point its hard to imagine that theres anyone who still believes that suburbia is full of wholesomeness and welladjusted people the premise  that the image of is merely a veneer which hides a dark and desperate inner life  is just not fresh enough to carry a whole movie but its not even a question of whether the premise can carry the movie in spite of what some other reviewers have said this is most certainly not a boring film and it does stick with you like very little else i have seen so there is definitely some power here which doesnt exist in similar inferior films like magnoliabut i guess what bugs me about this film is that it seems to rely on the principal failing of postmodern thought  that it is merely enough to point out the sheer arbitrariness and duplicitousness of contemporary existence and the values we extol in a way the exposing of this arbitrariness and duplicitiousness creates an even bigger problem than the problem it exposes life is bleak life is meaningless i get it the question is not whether this is true the question is what can be done about it how does a film which thrives on bleakness and conveys only bleakness and ends in bleakness and exists only to paint a picture of absolute bleakness accomplish anything at all social satires primary purpose is to do something in the social realm  does this film accomplish anything except to depress its viewers it certainly didnt for meon a lesser note but still noteworthy  the grossout stuff seems totally out of place even given the films subject matter and really detracts from what it does do well five minutes worth of material being edited out certainly wouldnt make the film any more hopeful but it would make it stronger for what it does do,black_comedy
makes the same mistake that so many films of the last 1015 years have made it assumes that gross weird disturbing behavior by characters adds up to a meaningful film experience this movie offers little to recommend it other than a convincing portrayal by seymour phillip hoffman and the guy that plays the psychiatrist the story and the characters however are not worth your time if you do decide to watch this movie bring something else to do because you will probably be sickened or just plain bored i was both,black_comedy
because of the other good reviews and the high 78 rating we rented this movie  i was impressed by the cast and was looking forward to writing to match  i was very disappointed  i was expecting a painful movie to watch but in the good way where you can really relate to the pain that the characters go through  what was missing was any sort of sympathy for the characters or even something to make me hate them  alas more than halfway through the movie i really didnt care about any of the characters anymore and decided i had wasted enough time watching  its extremely rare for me not to see a movie through to the end but it was simply torture to watch the very long 10 minute scenes where not all that much happened and i started forgetting about all of the other charactersthings happened but with no insight into why they happened why did the characters do the things they did  without giving too much away why did the grandfather living in florida feel nothing  why did he want to be alone  what about helen  having a scene where she screams im no good is just awful writing show me dont tell me and especially dont have her tell us shes no good but then wont follow through when the opportunity allen at the door arises for her to show us that she really thinks that she isnt a deserving personi could go on but ive already wasted enough of my time on this,black_comedy
ok i dont normally bash movies so dont think this isnt founded  this movie is utterly disgusting  its not even worth wasting your time on its completely sick to make a comedy about a guy raping a little kid in the butt at his sons sleep over  and thats not entirely the worst of it  if i could swear here id say more  but trust me nothing grosses me out and this grossed me out competely  id never utter the words dont watch this but umm dont pay to watch it  phillip seymour hoffman is an amazing actor but i cant believe he did this movie  maybe its just me but i really hated this movie and i would honestly call it the worst thing ive ever seen  never once was i even marginally entertained,black_comedy
this movie has nothing positive to offer the art of filmmaking or to the hapless innocent victims who decided to watch it  mr solondz does a horrible job of making a commentary on modernday problems and the sick twisted people who have to deal with them  this film is incredibly meanspirited badly paced and makes little use of its highlytalented cast with such brilliant actors as phillip seymour hoffman and louise lasser  mr solondz obviously thought he was creating a work of art by assembling this sordid tale complete with serial rape spousal abuse and a woman who chops up her doormans genitals and stores them in a refrigerator what bothers me is not the nature of these crimes and their respective severity but how mr solondzs direction tries to play them off as everyday occurrences that are better laughed at then dealt with seriously  his attempt to make a lighthearted mockery of perversion is better left to a director with a bit more satirical experience under their belt,black_comedy
i watched this movie when i was a film school student it was brand new hot out of distribution and id heard of todd solondz as a filmmaker who dared to make different films which i figured meant superior see it worked as entertainment the acting and photography was fine and yeah it was different a pedophile is shown in a sympathetic light some fat loser uses his own jizz to stick pictures to the wall of his tiny studio apartment yeah thats different but what was the point in showing us all this sht and why is it even entertaining to watch because the movie conditions me to think that this is reality and that i should join the director in being comfortable with reality like if these sick situations are so common that all these people are having them at once then i should be cool with it and be a little proud of how this movie enlightened meits scary how they pulled this off young and impressionable i ignored how disgusting and bereft of meaning this movie was because it looked good and i understood it was hip i ate it up and almost fifteen years later the foul aftertaste still lingers in the back of my mindugh everythings propaganda now i have had my share of sickness and this movie isnt groundbreakingly truthful i think its the director trying to convince everyone else of his deeply cynical and unrealistic view of middle class america also i dont know how this would play out in reality but i doubt that a little boy getting sodomized by a grown man during a drugged stupor would just wake up the next morning without being being very upset and in a lot of pain exploiting child rape and trying to pull it off like its dark comedy there should be a name for that something that means vapid and often offensive bullsht masquerading as having substance i think hipster crack is a good enough term theres just something off about it something fake something truly sick and immature like a friendly kid who wears expensive clothes and has lots of cool stuff but when you visit his house he wants to play by torturing cats,black_comedy
this movie has been on my personal to see list for quite some time i have searched for it at nearly every retail video store but without any success ironically i found it at the local family video and after viewing it with some friends i must say my expectations were met even surpassed thought american beauty was a masterpiece try this one and youll probably agree american beauty is a watered down disney flick compared to this i laughed my ass off at philip seymour hoffmans performance as well as the frighteningly funny performance of the all so familiar suburban yuppie dad character who is disturbingly normal yet seems to have a unhealthy obsession with little boysfun for the entire family,black_comedy
i was furious when i finished watching this movie  the production value was fine i expected nothing less from solondz whose work i had enjoyed up to this point i had thought that he had the delicate balance of humor and tragedy after seeing welcome to the dollhouse  i was wrong  this experiment in suffering only goes to show that solondz is a onetrick pony and his trick is to make his audience uncomfortable  every character in is laced with a cliched and sinister sexual repression which turns the women into frigid and pathetic dolls and the men into sexual predators we are asked to sympathize with a serial pedophile and rapist who drugs his sons friends before he rapes them  we are asked to feel for the doormat kid sister who has the world turn against her throughout the movie   whats worse is that solondz has an arsenal of talent that he squanders  camryn manheim is a fabulous actress why cast her as generic fat person  philip seymour hoffman can do so much more than just ejaculate on a wall and look creepy  solondz barely took advantage of the actors he had and was left with a shoddy storythere are two things that make a story successful  one is how you tell it and solondz did an average job at that  the other which is probably the most important is to have a story worth telling  otherwise it doesnt matter how good the sound is and how much film you shoot on  if the story is terrible there is no hope for the movie,black_comedy
this is a bad film with some excellent performances its really unfortunate because it could have been quite good had it been less graphic unfortunately solendz hits the audience in the face with overthetop scenes that can do nothing but revolt the viewer for example the films final scene in which the son comes out so to speak is totally overpowered by its graphic nature and the fact the dog and then his mothershare in this victory  presumably that and other scenes were intended to be funny i couldnt bring myself to laugh however he did manage to be more gross than just about any film you can think of something about mary and all of the early john waters films included congratulations mr director ironically ive heard critics talk about the films nuanced and subtle display of the depravity of american life please this was subtle like natural born killers was subtle it was two hours of the jerry springer show with better actors when are critics going to grow up and stop giving out awards to people just because they push the envelope when the envelopes empty all thats left is is the shock value and in this movie 2 hours and 20 mins of shock is way too long  at least i bonded with the rest of the theatre who were also uncomfortably squirming coughing and looking at their watches,black_comedy
while i was watching solonds film i kept getting the feeling that something wasnt right in the way the story is told the characters seem to be solid enough the way they lives intertwine are credible but the overall tone of irony and is totally inappropriate it seems that solondz is particularly worried in showing how witty and sarcastic he is and in maintaining is cultstatus rather than prove that he can also direct a film if we take away the shockvalue of the topics he deals with there is nothing else in that can make it stand above other current american indies,black_comedy
ok i admire the the fact that the filmmakers here are actually able to make the audience somewhat sympathetic with a character so destructive as the pedophile father not an easy task for a director to pull off  it made me cringe but it was well done   and the lonely guy making obscene phone calls actually comes across as a sympathetic person also great  well done  the movie is populated with unsatisfied characters none of them happy with their achievements in life  fine now tie it all together effectively that is there are several different subplots but they are sloppily juggled     and the pacing is often fatal  the opening dinner scene with jon lovitz probably only lasts five minutes but feels like eternity  the awkward more boring than awkward actually silence as the obscene phone caller sits on the couch with lara flynn boyle  almost every scene between the obscenephone guy and a female neighbor who wants him is slow bits of nothingness spoilers coming up        and i nearly kicked my tv when we learn that a certain character has killed somebody and is storing the body in a freezer  having a character casually talk about such a murder is an obviously trendy gimmick  like theyre eating ice cream as she talks about having killed somebody  this movie is so weird man      there are a few powerful scenes but i found most of this movie quite dull,black_comedy
this movie has some decent plot lines and good actors but has some very disturbing elements  i find it very disturbing that no focus in this movie was given to the punishment that the pedophile received  however a great amount of screen time is given to the acts this pedophile performs  this problem is all to common in movies no consequences for ones actions  i normally would let this flaw go but there is no joking about child abuse it is just too serious a matter to ignore  while there are some good actors and scenes in this movie it just ends up being mediocre because of disturbing scenes and dragging on too long  i give it 410 for extremely poor taste and unrealistic situations,black_comedy
i can only view this film as a contemptuous stab at suburban life in modern america from a pained and vengeful outcast rather than true and vital criticism of modern life which is ultimately more lasting  solondz argues that this life is bleak claustrophobic deeply solitary and perhaps not worth the struggle yet he offers no solution hence my argument that was just a selfish stab  the challenge is not in presenting the problem over and over and over again that is simple and uninteresting  the challenge is in offering a viable solution  but while the types of problems solondz shows are becoming more common they are individual not universal  the value in is that it allows one to visualize the fantasies of the neglected unloved and mistreated individual which if you watch the news you have seen acted out in horrible and tragic instances  i probably wouldnt be writing about this if i hadnt just seen american beauty which while it is not great and includes some banal moments and a baffling unnecessary and disappointing climax comes much closer to an accurate portrait of suburban life and does finally offer a solution to the unhappy  that movie was at least an attempt to create a work of art if it is remembered at all will be remembered as the work of an unhappy craftsman not an artist  it offers little more than a shallowlyrepressed personal cry for help,black_comedy
is a film that perfectly utilises our ability to experience empathy as well as truly realise the horror that is human existence whilst being able to make fun of the many moments of despair we often experience throughout the course of our livesthere were a lot of moments of unexpected comedy in moments i thought the film would handle with intensity and all of the characters in this film were unbearably human showing their flaws on full display while we as the audience get thrown into their lives building deep connections with them that therefore makes the overall experience of watching really hardsome of the characters in this film live in happy delusions thinking that they are fulfilled when really they are just as afraid of becoming lost and some live in coldhearted reality often having to face the pain that comes with not having an escape and so to see those two types of existences flow in and out of each other was really cathartic was able to turn the pathetic and desperate nature of humans into something somewhat beautiful and undoubtedly unifying as we all have to live with unavoidable sadness and disappointment and our everyday dissatisfactionsit even touches on our fears of loneliness and death whilst making note of the times in which we feel the most empty whilst still being able to maintain its lightheartedness by showing moments of hope and kindness some might call disturbing but i really didnt experience anything too disturbing everything that happens in could easily happen in reality and so i didnt necessarily find it disturbing i just saw it as another movie that was very explicit in nature and that isnt a bad thing at all in fact i would say that is a good thing as films should strive to make an impact and successfully did that is as honest and as thoughtful as a film can be and i really really enjoyed it the ending was perfect too unforgettable,black_comedy
is a film that explores in a way that takes a look into the darker side of the things we do as people  whether out of loneliness or uncontrolled desires sometimes what gives us seems crazy to others so we keep them inside so no one can ever know about itand sometimes for good reason due to the consequences of our actions the film deals with people who feel either depressed tormented or lost in direction with their lives and many of them make the choices that they normally wouldnt do you have the a struggling musician stuck in a sales call centre job with no real direction an elderly couple who are on the brink of splitting up but dont want a divorce a lonely middle aged guy who spends the majority of his time calling random women and jerking off to them and perhaps the most interesting a middle aged family man psychiatrist who has the deepest secret of all which i wont reveal here just not to spoil itthat being said this is not a film for everyone in particular if you dont like subject matters of controversy and in particular dont get young children to watch this as it is definitely not appropriate for them however the film is done in such a way that keeps you sympathetic to these characters and even though the majority of them you would normally associate such people in reality as lowlifes and no hopers you can only imagine what their daily pain is like in lifethe film switches its tone to comedy then to very dark moments one scene in particular involving a father and son people who have seen this will know which one is probably one of the most psychologically shocking scenes which is just said verbally in my opinion no gore or anything but at the same time it is so horrific and tragic in that one scenethe characters in this film really hold this film together all the way and you are interested in all of them though i did feel the elderly couples story was the weakest out of all of them though still interestingthe film blends cleverly humour sadness tragedy and relationships altogether in one that makes you look at what is for some people even if you will never really understand it everyones definition of it is differenti would recommend this film to all my friends but if you told them the subject matter some might be put off but i think this is definitely a film well worth your time if you like controversial movies that go the next step to explore tabbo subjects,black_comedy
the writerdirector has authored a fascinating movie that is technically brilliant and hes assembled an outstanding cast of actors that dont miss a beat every role is well cast with veterans like ben gazarra and newcomers like hoffman the picture is rich in irony and avoids satire which justifies its description as a dark comedy my main issue after seeing it was to try to understand the films purpose i like ambiguity but this movie tears me between humor and pathos if the film maker wanted me to laugh he was successful even at the aberrant behavior of its characters but when the laughter ends like in the emotional scene between the perverted father and his son this viewer felt guilty for laughing in the first place am i to think of aberrant sexuality as amusing are we to glory in someone who rapes women over the telephone or who sodomizes 11 year old kids if thats the purpose then it denies any nobility the picture otherwise has without that scene and the feeling of being jerked around we have a picture about the strange routes that some of us take to achieve and i can have a guiltfree laugh at their foolishness,black_comedy
this film was sold to me as a comedy when its just not dont get me wrong its not because its dark ive seen comedy that dealt with darker subject material than this i think i snorted with laughter twice close towards the end otherwise its terribly depressing the film features suicide rape drug addiction murder child abuse etc and if youre going to make comedy out of these things then you have to actually play it and film it as comedy otherwise its just upsetting while the performances are good the characters are almost universally despicable and i didnt feel any empathy for any of them thanks to the films overwhelmingly misanthropic tone having said all that its a fairly good film its well shot well acted a little slow but just about gets away with it and definitely too long i didnt care enough about what was going to happen to the characters to watch the entire thing must have skipped about ten minutes in total but its alright just dont expect to be tickled,black_comedy
the searing provocative coverage of writerdirector todd solondzs film puts on two fronts the first one is a surface layer of the assumptive contentment within a middle america social class family underneath their deep longings and perversions are exposed viewers may be turned off by the unbiased cohesion of righteous and deplorable behavior but regardless of whether this is done in the name of black comedy or raw drama it effectively shares with us a range of harsh and happy truths three half out of five stars rated r dir todd solondz cast jane adams dylan baker justin elvin cynthia stevenson lara flynn boyle jared harris philip seymour hoffman camryn manheim ben gazzara louise lasser 1998,black_comedy
this is one of the most brutal tragicomedies ever made for a long time i would apologize to people before showing them this i watched itnot knowing what i was getting into for the first time with my motherand it was awkward to say the least however for the adventurous not easily offended this is one of the most incredible films i have ever seen the pursuit of was never more horrifically uncomfortable than it has been here all performances are amazing the script as good they get the music cinematography flawless todd solondz knows every button to push and he does so like a master puppeteer this film is why he is one of americas current preeminent film makers a film as hilarious as it is disturbing completely one of a kind ensemble piece about sex love perversion and the depths to which human beings can sink in the pursuit of pleasure of contentment john lovits scene at the beginning is one of my favorite in all of moviedom,black_comedy
on the face is a film that is uniquely hard to swallow at times i found myself wrapped up in a character and their faults the intention of this film was not to expose sexual deviants but to reveal a persons capacity for faults the characters lead seemingly non confrontational lives but every day they deal with aspects of their lives that cannot be swallowed todd solondz formulated his characters out of ordinary lives at the surface it seems as if the film faulted by not addressing each characters reason for deviance or discretion but there lies the genius they had to reason to molest young boys have sexual fantasies that are deranged or abandon the life they created for themselves each character dealt with passion and desire but they could not avoid its magnitude or incessant ability to invade the innocent parts of their life dr maplewood destroyed and convoluted his sons earliest encounters with sexuality but in the end his characters were honest deliberate and most of all opaque it scratches an itch that most would have forgotten or ignored but todd solondz exposes the ability for all people to deviate from the norm,black_comedy
can anyone tell me why they think todd solondz felt compelled to make this movie its not entertaining unless youre a confirmed sadist he clearly hates these characters does not feel any sympathy for them at all as opposed to john waters who tells stories about equally screwed up people but with affection for them none of it felt remotely genuine or based on life experience in any way  completely  contrived sitting there watching these pathetic characters being humiliated made me think the entire reason for this movies being was to give todd solondz an outlet for the worst things he could imagine putting people through who is joy jordan if not dawn wiener from welcome to the dollhouse grown up  what is the audience intended to take away from this film that life sucks what a narrow reductive view of the world if solondz is an artist where is the insight the resonance the beauty that the art of film is supposed to contain this guy is the hope of independent film,black_comedy
i felt like id been run over by a bus upon coming out of this film  i was very impressed with it a punishing but extremely well written and acted film  i question it being billed as a comedy  seems to me it is much more of a drama with a bit of comic relief to it  characters are mocked but are inherently sympathetic as well despite their often shocking flaws  very impressive  sure to inspire walkouts,black_comedy
on paper is the type of film that could breath vitality and freshness onto movie screens across america  unfortunately the film that i saw was not the daring reckless tabooshattering film that it was purported to be instead i found a film that was so clumsily put together and so filled with padding that its hard to discern what solondz was trying to say and if there was anything being said at all  is definitely a film that is worth watching for there are scenes which truly do fit the labels applied to it but the problem is that there is such a huge disparity in quality between those scenes which really do work to affect the viewer and those which do not  in an interview solondz has said that this film resulted from a multitude of stories which could have been films but as he was unable to choose one over another he put them all into the mix unfortunately this is construction is felt through the entire film as the ties which bind the stories together are tenuous at bestsolondz problem is not so much one of content but of cinematic structuring as i mentioned above there are scenes and characters that are truly interesting and do fit what many are saying about this film  the problem though is that for the few moments that are truly effective there are so many that are not only ineffective but are so poorly rendered that they leave a bad taste in ones mouth im thinking especially of the scenes with the patriarch and matriarch of the family  my own phrase truly effective has to be called into question as well for what do i mean by saying that a scene is truly effective  considering the rubric under which this film is being judged truly effective would then have to refer to the scenes ability to shock andor horrify  under this set of conditions i would have to say that no scene then was truly effective for me at all representing a pedophile as a sympathetic character does not constitute a truly shocking act  for isnt pedophilia perhaps one of the most sympathetic of sexual obsessions  in our society it is an act that has been deemed taboo but on what real grounds  there is something of a sadness around the figure of the pedophile as theirs is a sexual desire that can only be gratified illegally and the only possible outcome is the harming of the object of that desiresolondz film is about people trying to make connections in a society where forces are constantly pushing people apart form each other and from themselves  considering this the only true connection we find in the film centers around the pedophile and his interactions with young boys especially his son  around them swirl this array of characters who engage in meaningless sexual gratification and selfdestructive activities but here we find a character who really cares  isnt there something sad about the fact that true connection is deemed taboo due to societal ideas about perversion  if any of the other characters had found the connection which this film seems to be looking for both in thematic and in structure we would have been happy  seymourhoffmans relationship with manheim comes close but they are ripped apart in the end leaving them we suppose apart so that leaves us to locate the only truly meaningful contact in the film between the pedophile and his sonthe pedophilic urge underlies all of these scenes as we can only imagine the thoughts springing to bakers mind at the idea of his sons sexual urgings and perhaps we almost look for the scene where they connect physically  perhaps the saddest thing of all is that taboo keeps this thing from happening  his son cries as he finds out that his father cannot bring himself to violate the ultimate in taboo and make love to him like he did to the other boys  baker says he would jerk off instead  he has gone far compared to societal standards but he cannot take the final step so to speak  what this film does show us is how our ideas of what is appropriate sexual conduct derive so wholly from the dictums of society that we deny ourselves the type of love that might be most appropriate to our persona and contain ourselves within a label most often heterosexual which might not fit  bakers dreams of destruction may derive as much from inability to act on his urgings as they do from guilt over them  now im not trying to condone this type of behavior  as im so caught up in the types of codes which set the standards that it is hard to dissociate myself  im merely trying to think about sexuality and society and how they work together on each other in this filmim not sure if this was what solondz was going for at all  the fragmentation of the film into multiple stories blunts attempts to read anything at all in the film  judging form what ive written it might seem that the only thing worth seeing in this film is its depiction of pedophilia and that might be true  there are other nice scenes and even something of a hopeful cast at points but on the whole the film is unsatisfying  i do applaud the look of the film  the way shadows are used to give a sense of darkness around the edges of this world is nice and creates a coherent visual pattern throughout  but other than this solondz show a rather complete lack of anything resembling a cinematic style perhaps transparency is the effect hes trying for  i dont know  in the end the film is rather disappointing as i would have liked to see solondz either truly delve into the mind of the pedophile or extend the beginning questions he asks there into the rest of the films relationships,black_comedy
i left the theater wondering who in the world would make such a depraved film is a vision of pedophilia masturbation phone sex rape loneliness envy and a great many other various forms of sin from the mind of todd solondz while this movie takes film to uncharted depths of depravity in filmmaking this movie is also at the same time very humane while this movie deals with so called monsters in society serial rapists selfabsorbed fascists and sexual deviants the brilliance in this movie is that it doesnt fall into the typical pattern of simply funneling these easily despisable characters into established stereotypes by showing them as people who are like the rest of us but simply lack a certain basic moral judgement it makes it a lot harder for us to just pass them off as inherently evil it makes you understand why people in the news who discover child molesters lived in their neighborhoods always say but they were so normal,black_comedy
this movie was first described as a comedy yeah right it is a bit of a black comedy but really a hard hitting description of the dark side of our personalities we cant help feeling empathy for these sad people as well as a sense of outrage and anger over who they are and what their lives are about the important thing is that we care about them they are people with depth and although flawed are not without merit in fact their own flaws are glaring to themselves as well as us  the performances are wonderful and we find ourselves completely absorbed in their struggles  a wonderful film,black_comedy
i recently got to see this great film as part of the 1998 toronto international film festival and was rewarded with an experience i still cant quite shake  there are so many things that happen and so many things that are said that a lot of people will not expect and may not want to see or hear  i certainly wouldnt recommend that my mother see this movie and yet im convinced its one of the best films ive seen in years  it deservedly won the film journalists award at toronto  to go into detail is to give away so much of the plots fun so ill leave it for you to discover if you dare,black_comedy
the best thing about todd solondzs new comedy i put this in quotes because while i loved the film it didnt make me laugh nearly as often as some of the other patrons in the theatre on the night that i saw it isnt that its about pedophilia obscene phone calls prepubescent impotence dont ask or postcoital murder  the best thing about this film is that it doesnt moralize  as a responsible member of society i know that pedophilia is wrong i dont need to be told  todd solondz has done something very courageous  he has dared to enter the minds of the pedophile the obscene caller and the miserable loser to show me what life looks like from their vantage point  be warned that its not pretty but it is provocative unsettling and brilliant,black_comedy
this most memorable and haunting line from the most memorable scene of this most memorable movie sums up my feelings for the movie and for dylan bakers incredible performance which will certainly be unjustifiably ignored come awards time  in fact great performances all around including another impeccably cynical turn by ben gazzara who unfortunately does not break out into song this time  my friend joanne wont see this because she goes to movies to be entertained not devastated she hasnt seen the sweet hereafter either  i found it to be both entertaining and devastating kind of a perverse 90s version of american graffiti  i laughed out loud laughed uneasily to keep from crying cried and wont forget this film for a long time,black_comedy
this is one of the most courageous breakthroughs in contemporary american cinema writerdirector todd solondz deftly fuses caustic wit and disturbing drama to create a powerful vision of a warped american society this film though certainly not for all tastes serves as a wakeup call to all those interested by the abominable behaviour that is currently taking place under the masquerade of socalled normalcy,black_comedy
what exactly is this film attempts to explore but mostly by focusing on what and where it isnt  todd solondz the writerdirector of this film evidently has a penchant for exposing the rottenness in american life  his 1995 welcome to the dollhouse was something of an instant classic in its portrayal of teenage alienation and angst  the brilliant contradictions of that film were followed by in 1998 then in 2001 with the predictable and obvious storytelling which used shock as a pretense for depth made no worthwhile point and was ultimately degrading and abusive  in he retains some of the wit and irony of dollhouse while clearly moving in the direction of making the obvious seem profound  at least in this one he does seem to like some of his characters enough to flesh them out with believable personalities even while dragging them through miseries of their own creation  partially therefore the message seems to be that people tend to spoil their own best chances at by living their lives too close to the mirror  in other words not being able to see themselves from a wider perspective they never learn anything from their experiencesunfortunately while that message can be found here it does not seem to have been intended  solondz likes to make his point by making no point at all  life is absurd and there is no point  but while such wholesale nihilism may seem profound by championing the popular notion that there is no meaning or purpose to life it rather begs the question by presuming too much  that life may seem absurd does not mean that all apparent absurdities are equally ugly and rotten  indeed many of the absurdities of life are quite delightful beautiful perhaps even inspirational  by focusing only on the negative therefore this story gives its audience no hopenobody knows and there are no answers it vainly argues  even the psychologist doesnt know anything and just in case we might have been tempted to think that he could he is presented as a psycho with a secret obsession too unspeakable to mention  hence no one can be trusted  if even the psychologists are at root hypocrites liars or fools then how much less anyone else this film amply demonstrates  everyone is stupid nothing makes sense and anyone who pretends to think otherwise is either a victim or a predator  which is not to say that this film is lacking in perception or wit just that its view of humanity is cynical and pathetic  it is intellectual ism  not in terms of how it can rise above but in terms of how it can sink below,black_comedy
caution contains spoilersi just finished watching and felt a very moved by the portrail of the many dysfunctional characters the various obsessive behavioural paterns are acted out beautifully and more importantly very subtly a script that abounds in so many freaks runs a very high risk of being overacted however the entire cast succeeds admirably in avoiding this pitfall once again hofman shows that the only thing between him and an oscar is picking the right roles this film being to controversial for the academythe plot is worked out excellent the deeply disturbing presence of a childrapist is shown as if it could happen in any surrounding childrapist are not necessarily complete social outcast that never wash or shave they dont have to stick out like a sore thumb the fact that the movie doesnt seem to condemn it directly doesnt mean is it tolerated the absence of explicit comment on the childabuse means the director trusts the audience to know right from wrong this goes for the rest of the inexcusable behaviour in the film as wellthe various other motifs like the loneliness and addictions are acted and shot very nicelyhowever some things seem to be missing in order for this film to be up there alongside american beauty my all time favorite i must confess i found the directing in itself very powerful but the overall images in the film very to bland the were not enough shots that i wanted to see again i dont mind static shots as long as there are good to look atfurthermore the musical score just didnt do it for me i seems to have been a conscious desicion to reserve a small part for the music but its a choice i feel that hasnt worked out to me it makes the movie seem a bit to longall in all a very very good film but it wont make it into my favorites,black_comedy
possible spoilersfirst off this is one of my favorite movies ever the way the story develops and reveals its characters makes you empathize with them even if you cant relate to their situations and feelings ive heard alot of people say something to the affect of the more disturbing a film is the more people will want to label it as artsy and say how amazing it is when talking about this film i do not think this is the case this film portrays deceit and honesty on the same level the characters admit to desires and emotions that most people would let sleep in the silent corners of the mind we see that from start to finish in this movie  from where the drunken societal pervert says in his therapy session everytime i see her i just want to pump her to where dylan bakers character admits that his bloodspattered park dream awakens a sense of comfort in him these characters are honest with their feelings and i think this film is more of a satire about how dishonest weve become to ourselves and how we rationalize our feelings until they fit societys vision of normal in a world so quick to diagnose anyone who says something out of the ordinary as crazy  this film explores the antithesis of that facade and the dark yet realistic corners of the human mind,black_comedy
the title of this movie is savagely ironic because no character in it finds in fact this is probably the most depressing movie of all time ive only seen one movie that might compare johnny got his gun the best way i can describe is that its an interwoven mosaic of the worstever experiences in the lives of six or eight characters all of us have had experiences the mere thought of which makes our hearts clench with disgust this film is filled with nothing but such experiences it leaves you with a feeling of defeat disgust and hopelessness but for that very reason  because its such a fierce assault against every existing film convention  its incredibly powerful and well worth seeing if everything i said doesnt turn you off,black_comedy
without trying to be overly verbose this film has some unappealing subject matter however it is handled in a way that makes it feel very real the cast is absolutely wonderful the script firstrate and the direction is flawless if you have not seen this film run to the video store to get it btw the end gag is one of the funniest in screen history albiet a bit gross,black_comedy
an incredible cinematic achievement solondz will from here on in be known as one of the great auteurs of the cinema of awkwardness his characters while so nonnormative that they could easily be described by the general moviegoing public as perverted either sexually or socially actually provide a genuine source of identification if not due to their actions then their environment the suburbs have long been examined as a source of perversion or subversion but much like solondzs previous feature welcome to the dollhouse provides a fresh if not more disturbing examination of this reference point sitting in a cinema with 300 hundred other people allows one the possibility of witnessing the devices of awkwardness in action no doubt anyone who did see the film in its cinematic release can testify that the only way to get through this movie without feeling somehow to blame for what is going on in the world which solondz creates to mirror our own is to laugh uncomfortably and boy did people laughand while they were laughing i kept looking around wondering how many of them were feeling this pang of guilt or identification is an amazing film because while it doesnt condone what it represents it places it in the context of the everyday of the banal of the family and the individual,black_comedy
this film tends to disturb people  unlike other disturbing films such as blue velvet which present the darkest actions and motivations in settings that are heightened to be satirically pristine or hellishly dark presents things ranging from obscene phone calls and adultery to rape pederasty and murder in an almost mundane environment  so mundane that the people in this film could easily be your neighbors  this film features astounding performances all embarrassingly overlooked by the academy particularly dylan bakers portrayal of the aforementioned pederast  he makes us understand how hes losing control of his attraction to little boys in a miraculous way  he makes up glad we arent in his shoes and we never hate him more than he hates himself  the cast is uniformly excellent so its difficult to point to any one stnndout  the films only drawback is its lack of focus  at the center and there is  center are three sisters played by cynthia stevenson the housewife who has it all including a pederast husband lara flynn boule the successful poet who believes shes a fraud because she writes poems about rape without ever having been raped and jane adams the neer do well whose sweet disposition has lit up a neon sign above her head that reads doormat  we not only deal with the men in their lives and their problems but also with their mother and fathers separation and ms boyles secret admirer obscene phone caller nextdoor neighbor who in turn is adored by the chubby girl across the hall  too many stories  yet every last one of them is heartfelt and interesting and very very dark,black_comedy
this has to be one of the most disturbing grissly films ive ever seen but the saddest part about that is that its so realistic i guess you cant put down a movie for that but its definitely going to stay in your head for a few daysthe film focuses on three new jersey sisters the story is done in a form of vignettes so each story is interwined as well as the characters so you ask where does the nastiness come in well for one thing one of the sisters has a husband whos also a flamboyant pedophile and another sister is a writer who is consistently pestered by an obscene phone caller which is actually her apartment neighbor thats not even the half of it just hear 30 seconds of the dialogue and youll know that youre watching a strange movie it never bogged down but the subject matter is unexpectedi really cant not recommend this as i really cant recommend it at the same time looks like youre on your own read what i wrote above and decide for yourself,black_comedy
were so used to the rambling noise those bigbudget productions make that we tend to think that  american cinema today its only about satisfying the cheap emotional urges of popcorn eaters yet once in a while theres a strike of pure genius coming from the other side of the atlantic amongst 1998s chosen few was definitely the bestthis is a movie that portraits violence and frustration solitude and cruelty enclosed in a frame of numb fragile and clueless despair theres no message of hope hidden somewhere no symbolisms on the set no phony final redemption of our heroes  and you cant stop laughing your socialoriented conscious wants you to reject this crude exhibition of weaknesses but you just cant help it this ridicule of everyday life overrides the censorship of a sane civilized mindwhats all about anyway well its a test you see dont matter if you identify yourself with the emptiness its characters experience it only matters if you can laugh at it if you dont you fail like the girl sitting behind me who left the room crying only thirty minutes after the start of the film,black_comedy
personally i felt todd solondzs first movie welcome to the dollhouse to be very mediocre but after reading reviews for i decided to give it a shot blown away i was literally jaw dropped through half the movie the way he intertwines the stories with such an ease and the way he makes the audience feel like a voyeur watching through the window these characters seem to get into deeper and deeper trouble no matter what they do whether they deserve it or not and although most of these characters are hideous human beings you cant help but want to hug them and tell them its all going to be ok this is an a movie but i wouldnt recommend it to anyone,black_comedy
the story of this film was well crafted and highly original the content was totally vomitous and the two other people i watched it with felt physically ill after viewing it there should be a warning that reads if you like pink flamingos then this film is for you or if you are a perv go ahead rent it and relate there is no good way to prepare for this film even the seasoned indieart house film veteran may not be ready for such a spectacle,black_comedy
this should be a recommended text for philosophy i moralsethics courses the contrast between the morality of particular situations and the currently politically correct view of the matter is magnificently exposed anybody being shocked or upset by the film should think hard about where they get their moral values  their shock would almost certainly suggest that they picked them up second hand somewhere and hadnt really thought them out,black_comedy
the best movie i saw in 1998  believe it or not i saw most of the really good ones too  this is the sickest film i think i have ever seen but well worth it  if you are weak and dont like to be challenged stay away otherwise this is a funny original movie about a world where the worst can only happen  there is no silver lining and no happy ending  if you think your world is collapsing around you this will change your mind,black_comedy
hysterically funny wellacted dead on accurate look at the miseries of our middleclass lives that we would rather not acknowledge much less watch a movie about thank you very much highly recommended by this viewer use it as a litmus test for your appreciation of honesty and your sense of humor in regard to this absurd existence we have created here in haveaniceday land,black_comedy
a very intelligent script a wonderful performance a bravado director i was speechless a comedy of our miseries produced with the simplicity and the pathetic point of view of real life,black_comedy
as i read the numerous reviews posted here i couldnt help but notice someones comment expressing how they walked out of this film feeling the complete opposite of  fyi its called irony  if youre one who cant stomach the reality that life is not all christmas carols camping trips and apple pie then this film isnt for you however if youre one that likes to get hit in the face with the dark side of reality then by all means you must see this film in spite of the profound humor it is still highly disturbing  nevertheless its the best film ive seen in yearsabsolutely brilliant  john waters meets woody allen,black_comedy
the really controversial and daring thing about this film is not its portrayal of a remorseful pedophile the consequences of his actions both on his family and himself are devastating evidently some people have taken offense at the idea that he is also a real human being capable of remorse and grief by not turning him into a nonhuman monster and by forcing the audience to get inside his head his actions become more terrible and more reprehensible not less so no this is not the daring thing about this movie the real daring aspect of the movie is that solondz takes characters whose lives are desperately outofcontrol whose actions are outrageously shocking and he makes a comedy out of it the movie succeeds because it is indeed funny at times hilarious and yet it does not take its subjects or its characters at all lightly all of the characters seem very real which makes their actions all the more shocking the movie forces us to see the story from each characters point of view even if that point of view is odd or shocking the music rather than intensify our emotional response shows us the characters own internal feelings for example when bill maplewood sees his sons friend at a ballgame the scene is shot as if it were a love scene complete with slow motion and sweeping romantic music this is of course the way bill himself would have felt at the time by shooting the scene in this way the viewer is forced inside bills head since bills object of desire is an eleven year old boy the scene becomes sickeningly ironic the scene is much more effective and in fact more horrifying than if it had been shot in typical hollywood style complete with scary horrorfilm music my only complaints about the movie are the subplot involving kristina camryn manheim which seems to have been added only for its sick humor value and the last scene the last scene seems to be entirely designed to gross out and shock the audience it is an unsatisfying ending to a movie which is not just trying to shock us but instead trying to show us the dark unseen and alltootrue corners of american life,black_comedy
solondzs film merely reinforces my impression that american independent cinema is the finest in the world sparkles with comedy yet there is a constant sickening thud as scene after scene revels in the grossest blackest examples of human behaviourthe packed audience on the night i went was frequently in hysterics at the tactlessness and hopelessness of the characters so much so that im going to have to go back to catch all the jokes i missed because of the laughter as the film developed however a chill crept slowly over people and the crucial sequence between dylan baker and his son was met in gripped silence apart from a couple of idiots in front of me who found the whole thing hilarious  though perhaps they were laughing as a nervous reactionsolondzs triumph lies in his audacity so often i found myself catching my breath gasping in horror at what he had put on film but managing at the same time to express admiration that he had done it so skilfully to be able to make a paedophile a subject of humour successfully and to make him a sympathetic character at the same time is an achievement so profound i cannot express my awe it is only sad that dylan baker who deserved a best supporting actor oscar more than any of the nominees was denied a place in the hall of fame presumably precisely because of the nature of his roleattention naturally focuses on baker but the other cast members are perfection especially hoffman and adams a real find  where did she spring up from nobody in this film is likeable  yet we recognise ourselves in their frailty and cannot help rooting for themi give it 9 rather than 10 out of 10 because it has a few faults solondz could have trimmed 1015 minutes off it he has a tendency to linger at the end of sequences the story of the divorcing parents never really goes anywhere where it could have been the most interesting and the revelation of hoffmans overweight neighbour strikes a false note  the only time when solondz goes a little too much ottbut overall i salute todd solondz for courage wit intelligence and humanity if only more films could be like this,black_comedy
solondzs higher budget and epiclength follow up to welcome to the dollhouse provokes much the same confused response in that you are never sure if you are meant to be laughing or not it traces a few days in the lives of some of the most piteous characters ever committed to celluloid dysfunctional in their relationships with one another their sexuality and their aspirations the number of characters involved are responsible for the lengthy running time because aside from a dominant story involving the paedophile activities of one of them the actual substories which occur are generally low key and trivial this is not a criticism because solondz has obviously set out to portray a suburban milieu which is poorly represented by the us mainstream what is questionable is whether subject such as paedophilia should be treated as comedy given the brouhaha which arose over the release of adrian lynes lolita last year im amazed that the subject has come up in so many recent films similar to class trip and festen treats it more as a plot device than a serious matter but it is not clear what sort of reaction solondz is trying to elicit here the scenes with father and son discussing masturbation were met with stony faced silence and a few embarrassed sniggers in the audience with which i was sitting there must be more to black comedy than mere taboo breaking on the whole though the rest of the film is funny and wellmade and succeeds because the characters are recognisably human something which neil labute should take note of after the depressingly unamusing misanthropy of your friends and neighbours aside from a few instances where it just goes too far is an entertaining film but id like to believe that this schadenfreude approach to comedy is going to soon run out of mileage,black_comedy
todd solondzs follow up to welcome to the dollhouse is similar with a bigger more famous cast who play deeply disturbed and sexually frustrated people living in dysfunctional families and lives and taking their sexuality to the extreme the humor is visible here but people with below average iqs would probably not realize it if it had hit them in the head there are some disturbing and shocking scenes because theyre never shown on tv except for theres something about mary but its real  everything you see here is real several flaws such as little contrived scenes and there are a number of plots and most which are never resolved leaving the viewers hanging but dylan bakers character which people complained never had anything bad happen to him at the end can be figured out without the director telling us what happened this is a clearly perfect a great film  only for the art crowd and smart guys like todd solondz  its something i cant bear to hate rarely does a film make me feel what made me feel its more feelgood than stepmom was and the hysterical moments are caught here another thing the title is just ironynobody is happy here or they think they are and just want to be,black_comedy
should art avoid disturbing the viewer judging from above comments this pic was worth seeing those who pretend it aint on account of it being yucky seem to prefer alreadyseen type of clichs following viewing came some reactions sexabuse incest and pedophilia arent nice ways to spend an afternoon at all does this mean filmmakers should avoid the subject as it didnt exist are we talking entertainment industry or art here from hollywoods point of view thats entertainment showbusiness others who hold different views often endup entertainers working under a producer with the boxoffice in mind a trace of the maccarthy era when point of view couldnt afford to be differentsince murder aint a nice way to spend an afternoon either how come its such a part of the entertainment industry i once decided not to watch films with guns on the poster or jacket i endedup watching some amazing subtitled flicks and being grateful i understand french,black_comedy
todd solondz has created the most uncomfortable and funny movie of the year perhaps the decade  the story follows three sisters and their search for what ultimately remains out of reach also looking for that sole purpose for being are an obscene phonecaller and a seemingly normal father who drugs his sons friend during a sleepover in order to sodomize him the gutwrenching situations are portrayed humorously but not lightly solondz is not justifying this behaviour but rather understanding that these are sick individuals that are ultimately trying for the same thing we all are just to be happy  by making this film he has presented the audience with one of the most challenging viewing experiences ever definitely the best film of 98,black_comedy
solondz is really a new direction wunderkind his characters in where somewhat sick but you can see that the director has loved the losers in his film i only could say the screenplay was better then the screenplays for shakespeare in love or the truman show the actors were top notch and the close scene with the dog belongs to the best scenes of the year if you like the films of the joel coen or quentin tarantino you will like the films of todd solondz nevertheless i will try to get his first film welcome to the dollhouse on video,black_comedy
the film is good it evokes every emotion it aims for unfortunately solondz becomes a bit exploitive in some portions though some of these segments are funny they dont mesh well with the rest of the film they would have been better fit to something about mary  d,black_comedy
as far as im concerned one of the best feats of a film maker is to accurately portray human discomfort far too many movies focus simply on pure mindless everything ends up perfect in the end dialogue is flawless and people never hunt for words or thoughtstodd solondz has that gift of being able to make an uncomfortable film that is still entertaining he did it before with welcome to the dollhouse and now hes outdone himself with this is truly a movie for anyone strangethe story revolves around peoples search for and as it usually is with life most of them never find it the discomfort and awkwardness of life is seldom truly displayed in film but here solondz has done it fabulously and hilariouslyother films which in my opinion display proper levels of realistic discomfort are slums of beverly hills and vincent gallos buffalo 66 as well as solondzs welcome to the dollhouse,black_comedy
is very very disturbing but im glad i saw it  i felt uncomfortable through most of the film and felt gulity for laughing at the funny parts  however after seeing so many mindless fluffy films lately it was interesting to see something that actually made me squirm  no shootemup testosterone fight scenes no car chases no gory demonic villians in  just the really scary villians that exist within humanity all around us our neighbors our friends our colleagues ourselves  ,black_comedy
this is one of the most inappropriately lauded films in recent history the movie trades interesting characters and discernible narrative motion for cheap shock appeal although its ostensibly aimed at fans of art films a term as pretentiously ambiguous as the movie itself it really caters to the jerry springer set  solondz is patronizing amateurish and downright boring in his directing  if you want to see a movie with shock value get pink flamingos if you want to see a quality psychological ensemble comedy get a woody allen film if you want to see philip baker hall not a bad idea get boogie nights or the big lebowski its possible todd solondz will one day deliver a film living up to the hype that surrounds him but im not holding my breath i think ill just go rent crimes  misdemeanors again instead,black_comedy
is just one of those movies that youll either love or loath there is no middle ground on this one its just impossible to ignore i think that the volume of user comments here will attest to that fact anyway my personal opinion is that was one of the best films of 1998 i thought that it was hilarious yes it was also disturbing but at its core is a comedy at any rate is much much better than the similarly structured playing by heart which although it was a much warmer and brighter film than was one of the most mind numbingly insipid things i saw all year i thought all of the performances in were fantastic dylan baker was particularly noteworthy as the model father and husband who is secretly a pedaphile the scenes between baker and his son particularly the last one were amazing philip seymore hoffman who i think is hands down one of the best actors working today is fantastic as a chronic loser who gets off on making obscene phone calls my one complaint about the film is that hoffmans character should have been given more screen time  camryn manheim the practice is great in a small but memorable role as hoffmans neighbor who has a secret in her fridge i realize that this film is not for everyone but i think its fantastic and would have to recommend it i would have to provide a word of caution though dont see this film on a first date in fact dont see this film on any date unless you are very confident in the strength of your relationship also try to remember that this is a comedy youll probably feel dirty for wanting to laugh at this film but go ahead and laugh anyway trust me its funnyone more thing has the best last line of any movie ive seen in a long long time,black_comedy
well this certainly proved a revelation comedy may be but as father it certainly was a disturbing reminder that the world we live in can be very deceiving i have to give full marks for bringing so many raw issues to the surface in such a candid and straightforward way i felt very uncomfortable during the paedophile scenes and i have to take issue with the onesided perspective provided by todd the pain suffering and damage to the victims should not be overlooked too much sympathy for the protagonist is misplaced whether in real life or the cinema this is rated a 12 in francei can only assume the french censors suffer from overwork,black_comedy
finally a movie about the seamy underbelly of ordinary people really is this the way most people actually are perhaps this movie will appeal to all the genxers who are fed up with their parents rosy view of the world and for those who favour the current nihilism the title isnt at all ironic misery loves company this is the essence of,black_comedy
well this movie is quite something  it really explores the dark underbelly of american society  that is a worthy and noble goal  there is too much schlock out there and solondz tackles some extremely sensitive issues with candor and understanding  this movie is extremely shocking for those who find themselves easily offended  of course my headline is completely satirical and not at all true  kids should not see this movie  there is enough mess in the world without their voluntarily exposing themselves to it prematurely  but that having been said this movie is a bold and brave foray into a side of american culture not explored frequently enough  if we all had the courage of mr solondz to look deep into our souls and examine ourselves objectively we would not be so f up  while this movie is certainly not for everyone it is an important movie in that it addresses topics which most directors wouldnt touch with a ten foot pole  and the last couple of scenes really take the cake  im not going to say anymore but you should see this movie,black_comedy
this is my favorite movie of 1998 and not only because there were so many bad movies last year in the local art house where i saw this i was probably the only person laughing through the whole movie a friend who was with me said that he felt hed been dipped in slime ive never had a movie make me feel so uncomfortable all the way through its like a suspense film only replace the suspense with acute discomfort one of the most stunningly original films ive seen in years,black_comedy
is 1998s pulp fictionits rare when a movie exhilarates me and the last one that did was quentin tarantinos 1994 movie  unfortunately the same thing may happen due to this movies critical successthe door is wide open for inferior envelopepushing movies also thanks to theres something about mary  so i am preparing myself  contains material that i have never seen in other moviesfor that reason it is a classic the best film of the year in my opinion we are shocked by the behavior and most of the time were laughing  this is the blackest comedy ever made it makes no apologies for what it is  the actors every one of them took major career chances by simply appearing in it  the fact that it was nominated for a golden globe was very surprisingi cant see oscar touching this even for a nomination  many people hate this film and with good reasonit touches a nerve  but i have seen so many trashy big budget flicks recently especially in the last year and i found every moment of the film refreshing,black_comedy
todd solondzs followup to his wickedly comic welcome to the dollhouse is even better albeit darker and much more disturbing  tracking the hollow unfulfilled existences of a troika of new jersey sisters their families and an assortment of the other people in their lives the film successfully walks a tightrope between vicious satire and thoughtful drama solondzs scalpel is sharp and he never flinches in depicting the unseemly and generally taboo subjects of child rape and pedophilia which feature significantly in the narrative  the acting is uniformly excellent with dylan baker emerging as the standout,black_comedy
rather than tripping out superlatives id just have to say that this movie affected me in ways i didnt think movies could affect me anymore i consider myself pretty jaded  like a sitcom gone hideously wrong apparently normal characters take exceedingly odd twists and turns kind of like naked but much lighterlighter but as a result infinitely more distressing  naked could be dealt with on the level of this is just a depressing movie  gives you no such outputting mainstream people like louise lasser and jon lovitz in was a masterstroke it just drives home how utterly sick the situations are  one moment youre watching mary hartman in a nice scene thenwhampedophilathe most amazing thing about this movie for me anyway was the directors refusal to condemn the pedophile in question although it would take some ridiculously off track reasoning to think the film approves of him in any way shape or form  solndz lets you think what you want which takes cojones of steel  brilliant but very very very warped,black_comedy
what people who put down this movie because of its disturbing nature do not understand is that this is exactly what kind of response that the director would love to hearthis is one of those movies i really loved yet would never want to own in a million years  yet ive rented it multiple times and have watched it with people because its one of those films that to me is only worth watching again just to see the reactions of those who you are watching it withive always described this movie as a family drama gone to hell  it feels as if you are watching something like eight is enough or family or perhaps one of those wretched lifetime womens movie you see on cable it even stars cynthia stevenson who has been in quite a few lifetime productionsyet somehow its much more honest than we really want to believewe are seeing people as they truly see themselves before reality comes crashing in on then  even then some of them just go on like before because they want to believe they are happier than everyone elseits funny because todd solondz creates a family drama atmosphere with chirpy music and swelling lovetheme music as when dr maplewood sees billys friend and falls completely entranced during events that either we just see as plain wrong or they hit so much close to the truth for some people it causes discomfort and makes them want to turn the tv off or critique it because they dont know what else to do with itsomeone called this liberal hipster crap  ironically pedophilia is more relevant than ever now with the recent events in the newsbut the men who are commiting this act are associated with conservative organizations  so again maybe this is hitting a little too close to the truth than many people would like to admitone way or another this movie will either make you laugh make you shout at the screen this is just wrong make you cry or maybe all at the same time  fortunately with all those reactions are warranted and exactly what this movie is trying to elicit,black_comedy
i just saw this movie for the first time a couple of weeks ago and i couldnt believe it this film is so darlky funny and i could not stop laughing not only is it funny but this film also deals with very serious issues such as a perverted father i loved the scenes in this film when the father and his son are having their talks about sex while there is happy nice music in the background it was hilarious great performances in this film especially lara flynn boyle i was pleasantly surprised by her performance and of course phillip seymor hoffman a wonderful character actor was amazing in this film this film isnt for everyone it is very graphic and gross at some points but it makes it all the better all in all dont miss out on this film 5,black_comedy
this is truly a great film you must see it drama comedy about ordinary people doing what i suppose most ordinary folks do with a comedy twist and with a sincerity not many films of today come close to,black_comedy
an excellent film  well written acted directed and edited  but also brilliantly perverse a dark comedy like the twisted underside of woody allens hannah and her sisters or some such piece the film is manifestly sarcastic and sexual without being particularly specific or pointed in its bitterness and with each segment of the film the director manages to lift the bar of its own irreverence that much higher so that we are never left desensitized because he always has something else up his sleeve,black_comedy
ok whos the cynic here  is a comedy did we see the same film ive been fortunate to see it twice now and only on the second viewing was i able to manage more than the one laugh at jon lovitz opening tirade there are no oneliners no sophomoric grossouts no pie sex to be sure there is some brilliant deadpan delivery of the wise and witty script thank goodness for the brief flashes of humor never in my experience was comic relief so bitter and yet so welcome sort of like a glass of clamato just before you die of thirst the parade of bare humanity cast with a painters eye affords some relief but a comedy no is a gutpunch if you dont like to be challenged stay at home dont rent it read people otherwise gird thyself you will be left reeling guaranteed why are masturbation pedophilia dismemberment and selfloathing that shocking  wellyes actually and all the more so when presented so unflinchingly with honesty and without gratuity no gratuity you say is it necessary to showsay the things solondz shows and says sounds like the ageold problem of evil to me oh i know youd rather extrapolate a dark side from some candycoated nonsense a snidely whiplash who clearly posits himself below you on your tidy moral scale it isnt so easy to feel superior when your most private moments your deepest fears and anxieties are projected for everyone to see how can you face the row behind you after that quick get up and leave the theatre now  otherwise someone might think you actually enjoyed it see im a cynic too and thats why i know this brilliant piece of film is wasted on the general population its too frank too brutal  there is precious little here most viewers will undoubtedly turn away too soon anyone expecting to see real will leave as unsatisfied as the kids who sneaked in the theater to see naked lunch  though i propose this is real  nobody gets a break but most will continue on wow just like real life bottom line imho  powerful and deeply moving real characters superb acting all around thoughtful camera i applaud todd solondz et al camryn manheim deserves a best actress,black_comedy
i first saw in the summer of 1999 not knowing anything about it i could not believe how sick and ridiculously funny it would be since then ive seen it several times and have recommended it to countless individuals if you understand that this is a comedy then you wont feel bad laughing at this disturbing piece,black_comedy
i love movies that test the boundaries i guess how comfortable you are watching a film is how wide your boundaries are for me this movie not only crossed my boundaries but crisscrossed them i couldnt finished watching it i stopped watching it when the pedophile was trying to find the address to the little boy that was left home alone i just couldnt take it and i had no desire to find out what happened i could have enjoyed the movie if it werent for the pedophile it wasnt just that he was a pedophile it was his creepy desperation and his haunted humanity i just couldnt sit through it so i didnt vote on it,black_comedy
if theres been a more perverse mainstream movie than todd solondzs ive neither seen nor heard of it and i watch a lot of wicked movies  but thats not saying this isnt good doesnt touch onto greater human themes isnt tremendously well acted intriguingly plotted with realistic dialogue and an interesting and appropriate soundtrack still when one major sympathetic character is a serial rapist another an obscene phone caller and a third has dismembered the man who raped her when a son cries because his father said rapist wont rape him when the climax of the film is that sons voyeuristic masturbation and that is only one of the films two cum shots and the second of which is licked up by a dog and then licked onto the face of the ejaculators mom well lets just say this puppys got a major case of the kinkies not that theres anything wrong with that on the contrary the realistic torment of solondzs characters is one of the films strengths everyone is seeking and most of the characters take the pursuit to agonizing extremes only to leave themselves in even more misery only to lament i couldnt help myself with a wondrous sense of irony the characters who claim the most to have found are the ones with the least clue of their true situation to hammer the point home the female saddest sack of a character is named joy folks this is human misery at its almost most vivid itd be hard to outdo p t andersons magnolia solondzs tale is accurately and astonishingly well done with enough humor mixed in to keep the viewer from turning it off and running away shrieking on the negative side however is solondzs typical static camera work see welcome to the dollhouse twice first to be amazed at his script and heather matarazzos amazing performance then watch it a 2nd time and realize how devastatingly dull the cinematography is in that film the camera work was somewhat forgivable because it really really felt like everyone both cast and crew was still learning the ropes features a full cast of quality actors and a complete armada of crew members and yet you can see tree roots taking hold in the corners of some shots also unsettling is a sameness of the actors deliveries most every character is in near paralytic pain and this leads to a lot of supposedly supercharged droning but sometimes it just sounds like droning  maybe that sounds a little harsh on a film i just gave a 9 vote to in fact id give it an 8 but it is i swear one hell of a script still after the shock value and arresting depiction of human misery wear off you are still left wishing solondz would stick to scripts and let someone else direct preferably someone who can remember no matter what the bathos they are called moving pictures,black_comedy
synopsis three sisters in the new yorknew jersey area are seperately plagued by problems stemming from family sexual and personal problems with a set of people that make up this ensemble one is a language teacher trying to find the right man after a disastrous breakup another is a hollow and successful writer who is gleamingly generic while the other is an oblivious mother and housewife all of them unaware of what kind of problems they have one is being stalked via obscene phone calls by a pervert who lives in the apartment building with her another is unaware that her husband happens to be a pedophile and another thinks the right man may not bereview very controversial met with many objections from parents groups and the mpaa for its graphic content content dealing with pedophilia rape masturbation and suicide amongst other subjects that are completely off the wall real solondz deals with the material honestly because thats how he shows it dylan baker completely eschews any role hes ever portrayed to play a pathetic doctor whose actions drive him to rape a small child my sons a fag says one father to another its honest and its brutal and solondz wants the audience to understand the picture philip seymour hoffman gives a career making performance as the twisted pervert who has a bizarre connection with lara flynn boyle with camryn manheim as a desperate neighbor absolutely the most disturbing film that has been released in a movie theater pulls all the punches and its material while uncompromising is brilliant theres nothing more engrossing than watching saturday night live alumni jon lovitz suffer a nervous breakdown after being dumpedgrade a,black_comedy
i really did find this to be a very funny original movie that deals with alot of subjects that are not really covered much my only real problem was that it is does not develop that fast and it was a little too long to sit through,black_comedy
you know sometimes you see a movie to have a good time and have a few laughs this movie did not provide one of those opportunities this movie had that icantbelievetherearepeoplelikethatnowimscared quality to it i think that perhaps this movie is a little bit too much on the sick side my party left the theater and was forced to wait 30 minutes before eating this film was definitely not for everyone and i think im one of those it was not for,black_comedy
with todd solondz again has presented the world a cynical masterpiece the lives of a number of characters are explored all of whom are somehow connected to one another and all of whom have one thing in common they all pretend to be happy but are far from that in reality or what to think of a call center the crappy job of the decade employee who ends up in bed with one guy just for one night whereas she expected a true connection or her sister part of a socalled happy family but whos husband is a pathetic pervert in alle the film wonderfully great acting good dialogue and successfully investigates our notion of isnt it all a charade or is it just so and are our expectations to high the sarcastic tone fits nicely in this theme and makes it a sharp almost painful yet very funny movie to watchin short american beauty that also though in a lighter way put the difference between what we she show and what we are in the limelight but with a sharper edge,black_comedy
if a summary of the film was read to me before seeing the film i  might not have  lately film makers have gone to serious lengths to shock an audience  i brand the movie as tasteless if theres no reason for it action movies with blood and gore but missing a plot  these i cannot respect as film art  some of the most shocking movie scenes ive ever seen come from this movie  all of them seem relevant and important strengthening the message intended by the makers  characters do many different things considered taboo  however it is never graphic  any shocking  physical activity among the cast is totally implied  the actions of the characters are also different from most movies because their behavior is not glorified  your mind will start to dwell on the horrible things that people do when you suddenly snap out of it because you realize that these are every day people that have serious problems  the actions would realistically be unforgiven ones  however you will find your heart aching for an aggressor as much so as a victim  almost too true humanity and its bestworst,black_comedy
010801 tsk tsk this one never showed up at the theatres here arkansas because of its ludicrous nc17 rating but i kept it in the back of my mind and held out for the video with stupendous results this next effort after solondzs fine a dolls house is simply a masterpiece i watched it alone at first and was then inspired enough to invite a mutually film savvy friend to see it with me he was jawdroppingly awed this film is not for filmgoers who simply watch movies for entertainment is fine art while it may be disturbing and depressing that doesnt negate its fine script and story interplay the fact that one of the films characters is a pederast is hardly relevant as far as the films mpaa rating is concerned that character could have easily been rewritten into someone with a less disturbing problem he is simply there to add strength to the films argument what is the film trying to say that imho many of us in america are so befuddled selfish andor dysfunctional that we are wholly unfit to make choices about whats in our best interest about how to attain true instead we go seeking with our offkelter minds what we think will make us happy only to end up ruined because true individual stems not from shortterm gratification and desires but takes long and hard thought about who and what we are first know thyself then fix thyself and if you cant objectively know yourself or seriously help yourself ask someone or seek help while the pederast did seek help his problem was such that willpower was not enough he needed serious help even so i can understand why this film wouldnt be everyones cup of tea if you didnt like it that is of course fine but some of us were able to glean a most serious message from not that we didnt already know the message but that the message needed to be raised and kicked over as do most issues from time to time so we look at a film like and we are reminded of that which wed rather keep hidden or rather forget but that is only to our detriment910,black_comedy
the last line of the film pretty much says it all  it all starts there for us as we transcend from innocence to the much anticipated adulthood  most of our first sexual desires begin on the basics fantasies of sex with attractive people  yet over the years as our sexuality matures our once unconscious desires begin to emerge  this is what happens in what if you had suppressed desires for children or nymphomania phone sex etc yet you get married and live the normal life  is very effective in its openness about sex i had to turn it off because i could not take in the story of these people  it made me feel disturbed for watching  however the next morning i awoke wanting to know what happens to these people  i resumed watching and once the last line came i knew what this film was trying to say  sex is amazing how it interacts with all of our other social obligations and how it gets suppressed it is so primitive  perhaps our sexuality is the last frontier  the film is dark and i keep wondering why the beautiful writer was living in such a morbid building  the actors had fun especially the character of trish  the film seems to have a competition going on as to has it the worse  for some reason i thought trish was the biggest loser  perhaps it was because she had no sex,black_comedy
  a masterpiece to be recorded in the books and never forgotten12  a classic in time simply a must see  a solid worthwhile very entertaining piece12  a good movie but there are some uneven elements or noticeable flaws  may still be considered good in areas but this work has either serious issues or is restrained by inevitable elements deemed inescapable eg genre12  mostly a heap of nothing sparked by mildly worthwhile momentsbomb  not of a viewable quality unrated for strong sexual content including open graphic sexual discussions and for language and some violencei heard that this movie was disturbing before i rented it  then i saw it and although none of the material really stuck with me i was very offput while viewing it  so i wouldnt really call this movie disturbing but it was very sinister all the sameone thing that at least shocked me while watching it was the open discussions of sex  not only between certain characters such as a father and son but also how freely the film displayed this information to the viewer  the material was unrestrained as all films should be but rarely areas for the filmmaking style itself well there was none  it plays like a documentary  but i dont think anyone interested in the matrixquality pizazz would be watching this anyway  the atmospheres are dull and drab possibly on purpose and they offer no visual comfort  so even in a literal way this movie is hard to watchthe movie relies completely on the script  its all discussion and dramatic arguments and what not  it could even be a play  the main characters are all in a life they dont want except for certain ones that are happy who dont realize they are not wanted or cared for  these range from a pederast father who rapes his sons friends the son who wants to ejaculate for the first time as his peers do and cant an obscene phone stalker who cant confront women and a woman who loses over and over again and seems doomed for failure  the title of the movie refers to what all of the characters are in search foralthough this movie is unpleasant appalling offensive to some and emotionally wrenching it rings true which makes it all the more disturbing  it proves how much sexual relationships really affect our lives all that freud sht is true you know and how much related urges can destroy them  everyone should see this movie,black_comedy
brilliant powerful disturbing and hilarious is truly a great movie not every filmmaker can follow a deeply disturbing scene as when bill maplewood tearfully confesses everything to his son in such frank detail with a riotous closing scene that well ill just say it gives theres something about marys hair gel scene a run for its money but todd solondz does it without a doubt the best movie of 1998,black_comedy
the filmmakers point could have and should have been made quicker in each story  not so much in the story but mostly in the pacing  i had a room full of movie fans and students drop out one by one because of that reason most of them enjoyed the stories but wouldnt wait for them to unfold unfortunate because the ending was very good and phillip seymour hoffman was brilliant,black_comedy
probably the two most uncomfortable hours ive ever spent in a cinemais a bold and merciless movie it dares to show you the things movies normally dont show it makes you feel miserable i dont want to see it againits probably one of the five best films that came out of america in the nineties,black_comedy
i recently watched welcome to the dollhouse and thought it was a pretty good movie it made me laugh and made me very sad  and there were some uncomfortable moments that play quick and tense oh yeah my younger sister was also watching it with methank god there was no one around the television set while i watched  nicely everyone was sleeping the film was on cinemax and started at 115 am i was watching something else and when i heard was next no matter what the circumstance too tired etc i had to watch itif you watch by yourself and take it all in and know that it is going to be erk really disturbing then it wont be as bad as you think i thought the movie was really sweetnatured sometimes as when allen and kristina fell in love real love for each other and although the scene where kristina describes her experience with pedro may seem disturbing it also makes you feel bad for herthere is some great dark comedy in here and then some actual deepening depressing sadness as an important scene unfolds each pause between what the characters are saying to each other adds a really powerful feeling of suspense you really dont want to hear what they say nextafter watching the film along with its rather sick comedy wise and kind of funny ending i cant wait until the release of the new upcoming todd solondz film storytellers,black_comedy
ok wow i can understand why people would say that this was a good movie it was well acted and well directed but almost too well really considering the subject matter i cant pinpoint it exactly but even watching this movie by myself made me squirm it was just very intense and more disturbing than funny to my taste particularly camryn manheim for some reason her performance just really creeped me out but i would still suggest seeing it at least once,black_comedy
what a great movie this was incredibly odd but still a great movie another great film from the folks at cannes this movie was endearing in its weirdness while it is not by any stretch of the imagination a family film it is a great film about a familythe plot focuses on three sisters who are having their own problems with life whether they realize it or not but i dont want to talk about the plot so much as the actorsjon lovitz gives what is by far his best acting turn yet phillip seymour hoffman does another great turn as the creapy guy and jane adams and jared harris have the most realistic underline realistic realistic sex scene ive ever seen  i really would like to see more of jane adams who practically steals the movieall in all a near perfect movie 1010,black_comedy
tood solondzs new movie is avidly watchable  richard greco and lucas perry starrespectively as a holographic banana and the spider monkey who chases itnonstopthroughout this smart and intelligent two hour and twenty minute epicthe film is replete with nonsequetorial dialogue as for instance when jon lovitz asks for a simple explanation as to how a tv works and is told by a dark booming voice from the skies dont trespass there partner  simply smart and intelligent  solondzs notsosubtle reference homage to the abe lincolnshirley temple relationship in the littlest rebel made the holographic banana plotline even more humorous and shocking than it would have been otherwisethe twisted tale of pedophilia is of little consequnce in this movie  as my grandmother used to say if books were made for burning this one would have gotten stuck in the attic long ago  the selfrighteous american social culture among americans is sure to be more upset with the scathing critique of the narcomilitaristic industrial complexalthough greco and perry give reasonable performances one would like to have seen erik estrada as the banana perhaps  his classic role as ponch lives on despite his tragic death greco apparently hasnt gotten much work since 21 jump street perry on the other hand aside from his work with ron jeremy has been doing german cabaret films for the last few years pretty goodthe soundtrack is provided by up and coming japanese rocker chicks whitesnake  it is quite moving especially the blondie coversword on the street is that solondzs next project is a documentary probably about swedish farmers and the stews they love but ive also heard that he may decide on something else insteadyou should see this movie because it is so good and wonderful,black_comedy
this was a risk a movie that lets us see someone that even political correctitude would permit us to hate and still one feels that the choice is left to us is the shrink a vicious predator or a tormented invalid he is presented as wasp and even morally bourgeois an invitation to the viewer to gloat while denouncing the dr as a hypocrite he is shown suffering and intensely so the punishment for our worst transgressions is not meted out my the state there was never any doubt that the dr would never forgive himself neverfeel deserving of trust in this case however there is no gloating as a psychopath is said to do while enjoying his defeat of the therefore inferior cops no here we saw a man whose demons are all internal he has no axe to grind no need for a cheering audience he is at the mercy of a compulsion and obsession which only his death for so he believes could stop this is tragic but honest and intelligent throughly entertaining writ by maggot6,black_comedy
i actually wish that id seen this movie in a theater if any in my area had shown it just to see and hear the reactions of othersdefinitely the most twisted and disturbing movie ive ever seen alternating moments of hilarity and revulsion all throughout and my goodnesskeep your children away from this movie dont let them see it until theyre at least 18 or somethingplease im not going to talk much about the plot or the various scenes of perversion and what nota lot of the other comments posted cover that stuff in detaili will say that all of this stuff could and has happened in real life most likely not to the same family but it happensand i think the point of the movies is in the ending how the people move on put on smiles and try to live their livesmuch like a lot of people will do after seeing the moviedont talk about it dont discuss it just take it back to the store and rent home alone part 321bad choice maybebut you get my drift i did like this movie thoughas sick as it isit made me think one complaint and one only thoughtwice in the movie in scenes in the suburban family house there are visible boom mikesa bit surprising considering the otherwise excellent quality of the filmaking itself,black_comedy
explores just that what will make you happy one sister gets screwed in several senses but is happier afterward the other wishes she had actually had the horrible childhood she writes poetry about so as to make her work more truthful the third sister is a picture of too bad she is married to a serial child rapist with spree killing fantasies the husband a horrifying character is fascinating in his admitting that raping his 11year old sons friends was great for him it is difficult to see what hurts his own boy more his fathers monstrosity or the fact that he the father will only masturbate on his fantasies regarding the son a fascinating movie but do not expect to feel better afterward,black_comedy
this film gives a very realistic and believable insight into the underbelly of mainstream society brilliant performances by many of our old favorites such as louise lasser ben gazzara  and elizabeth ashley  as well as permanently ingrained characterizations by the relative new comers to popular cinema philip seymour hoffman  and jane adams  not the least of which is an unboubtedly oscarwinning performance by dylan baker they realy dont write many roles like that for mennot easy to watch at times but hilarious at othersmy rating regular admissionscale worst to best wait for tv  video rental  tuesday discount  weekday matinee  second run cinema  weekend matinee  regular admission  opening night premier,black_comedy
i want to start my review by saying that i liked this movie a lot yes i found it a bit uneasy and a bit stirring but not because of the subjects it touches  pedophilia murder rape  every day i see stories in the newspaper that report cases of all of those and a wide variety of other crimes and perversity it was the intimacy in which the stories are told  possible spoiler when little billy and his father speak about masturbation and later about rape the unspoken scene when allen enters helens apartment was one of my favorites maybe because its very real very possible the movies title is very ironic in my opinion because the movie deals more with the abscence of rather than that it is very funny in a very sarcastic way but also very serious and sad its a bit exaggerated well related to my own life anyway but not unbelievable of course for the movie to be like i describe it the acting should be excellent and the filmmaking flowing and direct as they both are id recommend this movie to everyone but not everyone wants to see the world in all its ugliness not that shows even one thousandth of it but is something close to all our hearts oh and on other reviews i read that people would like to keep children out of this film well i dont think it would traumatize them or hurt them in any way it isnt like children these days dont know about pedophilia or sex i think children simply wouldnt understand what this movies all about since a childs definition of is very different from an adults,black_comedy
this is one of my absolute favorite movies great characters  great story  some absolutely hysterical scenesi have to point out that this movie is not for everyone  i dont want to give too much away but some of the subject matters are extreme to say the least  this is not the kind of movie that your mother would like or at least my mom  you actually sympathize with some people who do some pretty horrible things  the characters that you really hate in this movie dont really do anything too wrong when compared with some of the other characters you hate them for being smallminded judgmental and phonythere are some hysterical parts in this movie but i see it more as a drama than a comedy  you really get involved with the charactersi think that one of the themes of this movie that other reviews missed is that it is about about what makes people happy  some characters pretend to be what they think a happy person should be and are miserable for it  some characters do whatever makes them happy despite what others may think and despite the consequences of their actionsthis is a very smart movie kind of like a more twisted version of american beauty  i was upset by the fact that this movie is not more accessible  i had never even heard of it until i was watching american beauty with some of my friends and one told me that if i liked american beauty i would like too  he was right  i realize that a movie like this is not going to be widely accepted but i would think that i would have at least heard of a movie that is this good and this well made the fact that i hadnt even head of it took a lot of my faith away from the movie industrythis movie is not only terrific but it is also entertaining  a combination that you dont see in a lot of movies  this movie is not for everyone but if youre the kind of person who can handle some extreme subject matters than you will love it  10 out of 10by the way if you have not seen this movie watch which imdb reviews you read  some of them give the whole movie away,black_comedy
i saw this film quite some time ago when it was released in an almost hush hush sort of way at the theatres it caused quite some controversy over the lashing it received from the ratings administration that it was released with a nc17 in the us and an r rating here in australia which is reserved for ultraviolent films or highly erotic filmseither the theme of pedophilia or the ejaculation shots helped this film to obtain an r rating but most cinemas would not show this movie it is also not an easy film to obtain at the local video store as most chains are recognised as a family store and do not stock films with the above themes in themanyway the follow up to welcome to the dollhouse todd solonz presents us with yet another hilarious insight to the us lifestyle so many people are not willing to look at and understand im not sure if todd solonz is gay or not not that it matters but as a gay male myself i picked up many campy themes and references to both and welcome to the dollhouse which probably makes both his works more hilarious than intended for example the names dawn and joy being his proteges for his films they are both unattractive losers typecast in a canadian bordertown who are totally blind to how much of a joke they are to the general society spoiler alert in we have joy jordan a 30something musicianwannabe who works as a telemarketer lives at home with her parents the youngest of three sisters and the main focus of the story along the way we see joy dating a coworker who she tries to dump nicely but has the tables turned on her when he gives her a timely speech and takes back a gift that he had given to her at that precise moment spoiler he later committs suicide because of this incident but his mother gives joy a rather hilarious phonecall about it seems that poor joy keeps dating losers as pathetic as herself as no one at work seems to remember who her date was after he does die when joy quits her job as a telemarketer she enlists as a teacher at a citizenship and naturalization school where she is to teach english upon her arrival she discovers that the teachers are currently on strike yet another camp moment where she has a head of lettuce hurled at the back of her head by the strikers  and another moment inside the building where a woman in the background cries im a scab to which her confider reassures her you are not a scab you are a strikebreaker upon hearing this joy is cursed upon entry to her classroom by her pupils as a scab and she corrects them by labelling herself as a strike breaker if thats not funny then you tell me what isin this class she meets a russian immigrant who sticks up for her rights to work as a strike breaker and he uses his charms to get her into bed needless to say once he does that she discovers from other teachers where she works that they too have been receiving sex from him a catfight erupts in the faculty room which will leave you on the floor splitting in two from laughter she continues through the film playing this character who you cant help but pity along the way her sisters one being a seemingly happy housewife who thinks she has the perfect marriage and the other being a welltodo journalist who is happy being a bachelorette and really doesnt care about anyone but herself in the apartment across from hers lives a male who is secretly obsessed with her and makes anonymous phone sex calls to her before hanging up after he has gotten his sexual pleasure out if it down the hallway from him lives an overweight woman who secretly obsesses over him and has a rather dark and disturbing side to her which i will not spoil joys mother and father are on the brink of divorce hilariously played by mary hartmans louise lasser she is obsessed with thinking that her husband is going to leave her knowing fully well he is having an affair she even makes a visit to the real estate agent to prebuy a house thinking ahead of the divorce among other characters is joys housewifeofasister whose husband is a closetpedophile who drugs and then molests his sons best friend during a sleepover his son is obsessed with discovering puberty and adolescent and his ability to ejaculate at his agethe closing lines of the film when joy and her family are enjoying a dinner together just about sums up joys lifewere not laughing at you joy were laughing with youbut i wasnt laughingif this isnt comedy then you tell me what is,black_comedy
i just like to say that in the review by mrhonorama there is a major spoiler to the ending of this movie in fact he spoils the whole thing by describing exactly what happens  i have seen the movie but i would certainly not would have wanted my film experience to be spoiled by this and think you should remove his comments,black_comedy
this is definitely a great movie and yes its even entertaining everything is about confronting the truth in a decaying society that we live in and i truly appreciate the director for not jumping into the popular hollywood scriptwriting style that prevails in todays american films  its also great to see someone attempting to throw the norm out the window  lara flynn boyle is as always very sexy and im glad to see the brilliant veteran ben gazarra back in formit doesnt bother me that the characters are not punished for their unlawful actions since the story does not revolve around the usual doctorine of the socalled civilized society  but theres one thing that bothered me though  about joys terrible experience with the russian refugee who happens to be a thief  at first joy was against the lame protesters who accused the refugees of draining the countrys economy which can be used for beneficiary pay  because of just one refugees bad attitude joy has turned from a refugee sympathizer into someone who supports the protesterss ideas against all refugees  all i can say was  what   forget the masturbation and the phaedophile rapist  those did not bother me in the slightestyes i took it personally  the main problem is that the film did not signify any irony in joys bad experience with one refugee as if the director made his statement about refugees as a fact  as a film student i tried to think of the directors intentions for the film and i always try to give any ill feeling the benefit of a doubt  after all filmmaking is about exposing the truth derived from the directors experience in life and in this case turns out to be great  but that one flaw about portraying all refugees in a bad light leaves me with a sour taste  i cant help it  it really reminded me the blatantness of birth of a nation by dw griffith which i watched a few years agoi really liked this movie but it actually made me think more about the merits of the socalled responsible filmmaking  i never cared about responsible filmmaking before until now thinking that creating a work of art must not be bound by societys standards  but if a film offends someone does that mean its a great work of art  maybe or maybe not  i dont know  i just hope people know better,black_comedy
i lovedbut ill be the first to say it may not be everyones cup of tea its so black im not sure whether its a comedy or drama certainly the 50s family whose father is secretly a paedophile is not exactly the stuff disney is made ofdespite the general lack of sex or violence aside from masturbation this manages to be a far more shocking film than almost any ive seen the scene where bill tells his son about his paedophilia is one of the bestacted scenes in cinema and you wont know how to react cry todd solondz doesnt seem to want you to love these people enough to do that pity a littlego see itif youre not the easily disturbed type,black_comedy
one of the most refreshing aspects of this film is its resistance to banal hollywood moralization showing the moral consequences of the psychiatrists sexual escapades would have reduced this wonderful film to the level of propaganda cinema or any other art form is not responsible for raising children to be simple minded law abiding citizens instead art should teach us to look outside our own social indoctrination and see things in a way not complimentary to our own view points showing the balefulness of film characters is a nasty habit which fills popular culture movies for example the green mile the gladiator etcas to the film itself i think it is absolutely hilarious and humor always stems from truth in that sense this film is a caricature of middle class life and all of its hidden perversions and despite those perversions solondz always creates empathizable characters it may shock some people to find themselves empathizing with a child rapist but i find it even more perverse to brand such people as monsters and not as people it is pompously and revoltingly moralbravo to solondz for creating a wise and brilliant fugue of modern misery,black_comedy
trish  the sister who really wants to believe she has it all but knows she really doesnt  helen the sister who knows she has it all but wants everyone to know that she still wants more  joy  the sister is who is constantly reminded that she has nothing  these three along with a whole array of characters truly make this film remarkable  what other movie exquisitely portrays a fatherson heart to heart on masturbation  what other movie is daring enough to show two senior citizens engaging in intercourse  its sick  its perverse  its savagely entertaining  its provocative  its not for everyone but if youre one for dark comedy epitomizes the genre,black_comedy
this film is pure excellence  if you loved american beauty then check this one out  it is very similar stylistically and just as brilliant as far as dialogue goes  mind you it does deal with some disturbing subject matter and is very much a mature film but that is part of its appeal  a lot of this stuff has never been dealt with so frankly  i applaud this film for its audacity alone not to mention its sheer artistic value,black_comedy
this is a very important and yes provocative film its not exploitative of its controversial subplot but dares to show that there is a very human face behind even the darkest of deeds stunning that a film like this could have been made so well so early in these times of media hysteria and victimisation stunning that a film like this could still make you laugh and very stunning that a film like this could have been made in america,black_comedy
after seeing magnolia and american beauty i asked a few people to suggest some similiar realistic movies  someone said ice storm good movie and someone else suggested welcome to the dollhouse and  here is my warniing  i felt obligated to write  i watched this movie with my girlfriend bad bad choice   this movie portrays sex and men in a very negative sarcastic light  it made for a bad weekend to follow filled with long conversations  wish i would have had this warning prior to renting  too much realism for a friday night,black_comedy
this movie is awesome american beauty was sort of a laim remake of this one reading many of the comments on this film especially negative criticism really reveal a lot more about the critics and their view of the world than they do about this movie and its totally understandable that everyone doesnt like this one what troubles me is that people expect it to deliver a suitable moral message to everyone i dont think or any movieis supposed to make you feel any specific things let alone teach you its just supposed to make you feel this one does a lot in numerous ways,black_comedy
when released in 1998 caused an uproar  after watching it for the second time it is easy to see why  the story follows three sisters and their respective relationships trish played by cynthia stevens is married to bill maplewood dylan baker in what seems like a happy marriage  however when bill speaks to a psychiatrist he himself is a therapist we realize that there is a lot more going on under the skin  in fact this entire film is about discovering whats under the skin of many people no matter how unhealthy  if there was an ensemble acting award at the oscars it would have gone to this film  there is no single bad performance throughout the entire cast spearheaded by dylan baker who should have received a supporting nod  his performance is simply magnificent  many people will cringe at his final scene with his son but rufus reed and baker play it so well that it doesnt feel exploitive or out of context  in answering his sons questions openly and honestly he perhaps saves his son from any future pain  bakers character isnt a demon but a man who isnt in control of his demons  the three sisters are portrayed excellently with lara flynn boyle leading the pack  her performance as a poet whos sick of being admired rang very true from her characters shallowness to her own understanding of how empty she is     this film can not be described as titillating or exploitive though not everyone will like it dares to tread where few go  one of the best of 1998 todd solondz was sorely overlooked at the oscars,black_comedy
each one of the characters in this insightful film see fleeting glimpses of  these characters represent all of us  americans have endured sexual repression for so long that the very concept of sex itself is a filthy one to be whispered and giggled about  until america removes the taboo of sexuality we will continue to see the tortured viewpoints these characters possess  those who feel guilty about nothing are not having sex,black_comedy
writerdirector todd solondz has created an astonishing film about 3 sisters and a brotherinlaw that combines humor pathetic empathy loathing disgust and sorrow  i havent seen a film with such a good script in some time and the acting especially by dylan baker is extraordinary  there is no in these characters lives and ironies are strewn all about the movie  the scene in which dr maplewood confesses his pedophilia to his young son is one of the most powerful touching and gut wrenching scenes i have ever seen  it makes you want to hate the man yet feel sorry for him see itbut not for the squeamish as there are some pretty controversial scenes,black_comedy
this movie shows what others dont it is about the things that people normally dont talk about but are just as much a part of reality and this movie is real frightening real the frustrations of the main characters are displayed and acted so well that your on the edge of laughing and crying everyone should recognize more or less of the struggles for of the different characters but the most interesting is in the characters confessions finally man and women are discovering some of their mysterious thoughts that move the most inner parts of them disenchanting this movie will knock you off,black_comedy
after years of hollywood sidestepping societys important issues and making halfbaked examples like philadelphia its gratifying to see a director face issues like paedophilia and urban dispair with honesty and courage artistically the movie is expertly cast wellscripted beautifully paced and doesnt fall into the trap of resorting to american sentimentality those who find it objectionable are those whose sensibilities im afraid do not lend themselves to worthwhile criticism 10 out of 10,black_comedy
i tried to explain this movie to a friend and could not eventually i said watch it its good  but what does that mean  by good i certainly dont mean entertaining because i dont think many people find suicide pedophilia and date rape a hip happening way to spend the evening however the craft of the film is undeniable and that could certainly be called good  i was captured by the film  i could not walk away even at its most desturbing moments i was spellbound by the father and son relationship  i cried for joy  almost everytime she was on the screen as the plot grew more twisted the characters involved became more real to me  i dont know what this movie was about but i was emotionally drained by watching it,black_comedy
this was a very funny film that a film with such subject matter could be so funny as it was is quite some achievementits funny how it is so but they say we get messages over and inspire people much more simply with comedy than with other forms of communication and this film does exactly thatthis film has the ability to turn around a lot of the private guilt and anxiety we feel this film exposes our dark inner worlds and makes us laugh and look at them with a lighter heart this film requires intelligence this film requires an open mind let this film in and it will inspire you,black_comedy
is a jaded ensemble film one that takes the chance to play with numerous main characters in a deviated america head onits a wonderfully written wonderfully acted wonderfully directed movie it deals with issues ignored by most of american film and uses them as plot devices and character traits in a way that through the films harmonious intertwining leaves your mind stunned and your heart warmedif you like movies that are unlike most other movies ever made this is the one for you,black_comedy
todd solondz film like his previous film welcome to the dollhouse is largely about people dealing with the dichotomy of who they actually are and who they feel they should be  however is a greater film than dollhouse not necessarily for any glaring reasons beyond the fact that solondz himself is improving in the writing and directing departments  though decides to take a grand scope where dollhouse was focused on one character and does it so effortlessly that the scenes dealing with the films three or four stories flow together almost making us forget how large the number of people and ideas were supposed to be keeping up with is  be forewarned though is a dark tale of people who are uncomfortable and who must deal with situations that may seem very disturbing and in bad taste at first but a discerning  and experienced viewer will find moments of tremendous emotional exposition and touching humanity amidst the father and son who talk nonchlantly almost sportingly about masturbation and pedophilia a topic in which solondz insight far exceeds the overrated american beauty the young computer tech obsessed with the idea of tying his beautiful neighbor up and performing grandiose unspeakable sexual acts on her the other neighbor who cant stop talking about pedro  the doorman  and his severed penis  despite that i promise is a comedy  kingpin it aint but there are moments of completely unpredictable consequence and surprise that will have you cracking up in the face of the bleakest human activity imaginable  most of all is like paul thomas andersons somewhat similar and equally brilliant magnolia the story of people who just cant stand to be alone or outcast it is the story of the world a place where everybody just wants to fit in to find someone and to be happy  to,black_comedy
some movies are disturbing just for the sake of being disturbing natural born killers is one of these films is certainly disturbing nobody however could make the case that like killers it is gratuitous this is because the disturbing elements are what make up the story for example one character is a petaphile the idea of this is disturbing we never actually see him rape children but it is spoken about in a movie like killers you would see it to some extent here you never do its not necessarry so its a wierd subject matter that is handled very tastefully the story is kind of a short cutsplaying by heart where there are a bunch of stories interwined and connected to each other the reason the movie is so great is both because of its stories and because of its humor you will never see this many interesting stories together movies arent that smart ussually if you get one or two good stories like in four rooms the other two are lousy if all four were great the movie would be incredible well in all four are great and more the humor comes from great characters and even better dialogue lara flynn boyle is hilarious this movie is great but not easy to handle,black_comedy
this is a fun movie to show to friends  an interesting view of several people in new jersey feels like a natural step up from welcome to the dollhouse which i liked just a little better  solondz does a nice job of creating heavily flawed but likeable characters even if the subject matter tends to feel a little too sensational  after the movie ended i felt as though all my friends wanted to either throw things at me or take a shower  oh well  a good movie with good performances  show it to your friends,black_comedy
i have read many of the reviews here on the film there seems to be a war going on between those who think it was real and worth viewing and those who think it is completely farfetched and just plain sick thus not worth watching i must say that i think it is a good dose of reality for those living in their own little sheltered worlds those who think that these kinds of things are not going on in todays world even right down your pristine little suburban street are the deluded ones yes it is hard to watch yes it is sick but it is realand it does happen i think it is uncomfortable for many because maybe it hits too close to home i think it is fair to say that anyone watching this film can identify with at least one of the socalled sicknesses of the characters therefore it is the look in to the dark recesses of their own minds that makes them so uncomfortable the world is a messed up place and we all contribute to that in our own fashion some more than others but nevertheless we all do because our lives all clash with one another at some point the best we can do is to face it and deal with it not act as though we are separate from it i suppose what i am trying to say is that this work is an important unflinching look at the real reality in this world and like it or not it does affect you in one way or another so you might as well face up to it by identifying with this film bravo solondz,black_comedy
yes it was gross and may have made people feel dirty churned a few stomachs made a few people faintbut it was good it was a good movie that bothered people because it was so real  hate to break it to you guys thats the world we live in  these things do happen in the real world but we dont have to see themwe can just speculate what happened without having to see actual cum shots or the act of homosexual sex or heterosexual sex for that matter so yes i agree it was disgusting but imagine what our own life would look if the world were exposed to all of the grim details,black_comedy
alright let me say this this film is brilliantly written expertly directed and sensitively acted  there is not an aspect of the production that doesnt reek of excellence  nevertheless i only give it a 7  why because when a film is highly recommended it tends to suggest that one will enjoy watching iti can make no such suggestion hereyou will squirm in your seata lot  i watched it with a group of about six men in their late 20s to early 30s and i have honestly never seen such a gathering of intensely uncomfortable people  i wouldnt give away a single moment of the plot or plots of this twisted masterpiece by attempting to describe it  rest assured however that by the end you will be struck with the knowledge that you have seen something incredibly masterful which you never want to watch again,black_comedy
for the people that thought this movie was excellent in all areas this message is not for you  i saw the other day without even knowing the tiniest hint of what i was instore for  i came out of the movie gleaming  this was one the best movies i have ever seen  all these comments about shock value and masturbation what are they for  todd solondz did not put this film togther for shock value or triviality  this was a well done movie with excellent character development  each scene was well acted regardless of what the theme of the scene was  yes there are people out there that are similar to these characters in many ways  the point of the film was behind the peoples sexual dysfunctions there are humans with lives  sex will always be a major issue in society  whether people want to push it behind closed doors is their business  understanding ones own sexuality is part of each person  the reason there are 5 billion people on this earth is obvious  so if people want to say this movie was shocking and trivialized topics they have a lot to learn about themselves or should see this movie again and admire what a great piece of work it is,black_comedy
is one of those movies that you either like it or hate it  it is very much the hidden truth and thats why it is so forbidden andor disgusting to others  it is not often that we are faced with viewing the mind of a pedophile or the stages of an eleven year old boy cumming also addresses adultery and physical abuse  those issues arent talked about at the dinner table if you know what i mean but do they happen  of course  they actually happen more than you probably think about cause those arent the things we like to think that society is about i think it is some what good for people to see this video because it goes to show that though people may seem healthy both mentally and physically on the outside they may indeed be disturbed on the inside  it opens your eyes to all the different things that may be occurring right under your nose took light and humor to issues that the public usually finds so disgusting and thats why it kept me interested  it might sound crazy but its reality is a movie that doesnt sugarcoat the harsh realities of this world,black_comedy
is a brilliant film although it is hard to watch at some points it is honest i saw after having seen american beauty which i didnt think was at all worthy of the hype and think that it says everything american beauty tried to say but with a depth and understanding of the human condition that american beauty only hinted at,black_comedy
this film is indeed marvelous todd solondz combines really absurd situations and embarrassing moments some of which most of us do encounter in daily life and some we hopefully wont with serious issues thus this film provides not only a very high degree of entertainment solondz sense for irony is exceptional it gives you a critical view on society without judging or condemning or forcing you to think one way or the other i am genuinely impressed by and its cast full of great actors i hope to see more of this talented director the only thing i know that comes close to solondz sense of humor and tragedy is elizabeth jolleys novel mr scobies riddle,black_comedy
just seen the movie i cant believe normal people would behave like thatthe film moved me to a new area that any film couldnt have i only identify myself with mr pederast thats the only thing that is special in it my wife did not bear more than 16 mins of it she had chosen the video and i stayed in front of the tv screen just because of the 400 pts she had to pay for it it is not a film anyone must see but there is still something interesting in it very weird for me and my european taste,black_comedy
i was reading something  about the next scorsese  i guess they meant the next great american director  they mentioned wes anderson david o russell paul anderson the wachowski brothers and some others all undeniably talented people  but the guy they missed was solondz  i cant think of anybody who can combine the comic and the tragic in such a completely believable manner  both and dollhouse contain those moments where the characters reactions are so real that you laugh reflexively from recognition while at the same time you may be saddened or even repulsed by what is developing on screen  i cant think of anyone in the mainstreamie available at the video store today who can create and execute the tragicomic so deftly and consistently  i cant wait for his next movie  i am sure at the least it will be different and more intelligent than 999 of the movies out there,black_comedy
while this film is definitely not for everyone i think its great that its found an audience this also contains one of phillip seymour hoffmans greatest performances watch it but know what youre getting into,black_comedy
this is remarkable i had been a huge fan of solondzs welcome to the dollhouse for a few years before i finally got around to seeing this masterpiece which in my opinion is even better than dollhouse and one of the greatest films ever made sure its disturbing and thats the point it also effortlessly weaves multiple storylines into one movie only magnolia is better at handling the multiple plots though i still slightly prefer on the wholethe performances in this movie are simply brilliant my personal favorite was cynthia stevenson as one of those typical housewives with 25 kids and a carpool her character was so obnoxious superficial and condescending  she clearly did a wonderful job philip seymour hoffman also deserves praise he is so incredibly versatile  he successfully made my skin crawl here louise lasser is simply wonderful you can see the despair on her face in every scene that shes in i was also a huge fan of camryn manheim what a twist lara flynn boyle she gives new meaning to the role of the phony snob dylan baker jane adams elizabeth ashley and molly shannons cameo which was hysterical and the child actorssimply brilliant and such difficult materialthe movie makes me feel completely numb and empty when its over but i cannot get over just how amazing it is todd solondz is definitely intriguing me  i cant wait to see what hell do next as for  1010,black_comedy
i think the thing that really tipped me off to this movie being bad was the sudden realization that my close friend drew who hated pulp fiction and thought that it was hilarious when kevin spacey was shot in american beauty would just love this filmreally this movie didnt do anything for me to me its just a bunch of perversions masquerading across the screen trying to be passed off at deep american beauty i could identify with completely with its pederasts pervert phone stalkers and hideously open take on masturbation handled much better in beauty i could not at all and personally i think that anyone who says they can identify with this movie is pretty damn sickgranted there are some funny bits in this movie especially the opening and perhaps the first hour or so but mostly it was just plain stupid nothing touched me moved me or even shocked meit just bored me,black_comedy
i found this film to be one of the best ive seen this year  i laughed out loud and could still feel the immense sadness plaguing these characters all the acting from the obscene phone caller to the poet longing to experience her writing hehe was fantastic  dylan baker deserves an oscar the film confronts issues no other filmmaker will touch  no one walked out of the film the night i saw it which surprised me  many people my roommate included walked out mumbling about the depression they felt  i however found the film to be excellently made in every respect  yes it can depress but it is also very very funny,black_comedy
 but still the best film of the year 1998there are moments while watching a film when you feel embarrassed because the film touches or you moves you in a way you dont want to be touched because it shows you things that are too real too close on your own personal life consists almost only of such momentsone could say that all characters in the movie are lunatics  but this would be far too easy solondz portraits his characters in such a realistic nondramatic and nonglamorous way that we really understand how they function and feel and have to realize that there isnt too much difference between us and them,black_comedy
this is by far the best movie ever made this does what movies are suppose to do it takes you to a place youve never been ever i dont care if you have one of the many problems each character has there is no way you have them all this film and fargo stand out because the characters are so uncanny with the realism this story is about so much more than it seems this is the real american beauty this movie is nothing in the eyes of the mass now but in twenty years will go down has one of the greatest films of all time todd really knows what the real human would do great film great,black_comedy
id heard and read the reviews seen most of the actors in other films and even though i havent yet seen welcome to the dollhouse heard a lot of praise for todd solondz now that ive finally seen this i can understand what all the hype was aboutmany people will not get the point of this film others still will refuse to and do as ive read in a lot of the comments posted before mine any film created to bring us a little closer to some of lifes darker harsher truths is going to be anything but popular with the majority and it will always be guaranteed to polarize audiences no matter how openminded they arenow has caused me to reevaluate my own personal definition of what a horror film truly is as a staunch fan of the genre i have always understood and accepted our need for the boogeyman in all his guises dracula the frankenstein monster freddy krueger the ghostface killer from scream the list goes on we have always needed greater horrors that stir something in our psyches to help us deal with the more real horrors that can be found in everyday life down the street on the front page of todays paper or even in the houseapartment nextdoorthats what makes a true horror film closer actually to the dutch thriller the vanishing than it is to american beauty even in its extreme overthetop depictions of its pathetic characters scabrous existences we are made uncomfortable by the one universal fact that will continue to cause solondz to be called both a prince and a pariah we all have something to hidein the quest for what we hope we desire we need to experience as we are sometimes prepared to say and do things wed rather not talk about and we definitely wouldnt confess to anybody else whether or not we lose sight of the difference between right and wrong good and evil in that quest depends on who we are and how well we deal with the truths that come back to haunt us when were lying awake at three in the morningbut enough about the films effect on me personally the cast delivers some of the most mindboggling work of their careers and in the case of phillip seymour hoffman and dylan baker both golden globe nominees for their performances here one worries about the future of their careers and whether theyll be hobbled by typecasting as mouthbreathing losers or fatherly pedophiles so remarkably realistic are the portrayalswould i recommend repeated viewings as a precursor to suicide possibly would i recommend that it be seen at least once absolutely if you want a reminder of what real horror is all about you dont have to look at bosnia or palestine or belfast or even columbine if you could lift up just one corner of the sunny street where you live and see what the neighbors are hiding underneath the wellkept manicured whitewashed veneer of their satisfied suburban lives that one glimpse might start you screaming and youd never be able to stopor maybe the darker truth is even closer than thatmaybe its right in your own backyard and thats what is trying to say when you pass judgment on people in real life who are a lot like some of the characters here is it really because of what you see in them or is it something you see in the mirror that youd rather notwith blue velvet david lynch showed us the scars underneath the smiling face of small town usa with todd solondz puts those same scars underneath the lens of a microscope and invites us to take a good long look,black_comedy
all contemporary filmmakers should learn from this film social commentary without the narrative and aesthetic schizophrenia of an oliver stone diatribe keep it simple challenge the viewer to think beyond their isolated perspective and entertain great song too,black_comedy
watching this film is like passing by a car wreck  youre completely aware that what youre about to see is going to be unpleasant but you cant help but turn your head and watch  i was uncomfortable with the subject matter of this film from the beginning  maybe im sheltered  the strange thing is something kept me from walking away  solondzs interesting camera angles and vibrant colours combined with a sick humour for watching characters suffer from their own bad judgement kept me curious about what would happen next to these doomed individuals  the recent film magnolia is much like in the way that on the surface it just seems like a controversial story meant to offend the conservative people of the world but underneath it is really just a slightly twisted version of real life,black_comedy
being that i consider myself shocked very infrequently i liked the pseudo normality of this film the idea that a child molester living in what seems to be functionality would be outcast upon the first presumptions from his community showed the fragile moral reality that we live in very true to life as well as sick and twisted we need more movies like this to show the obscurities of life,black_comedy
how come american beauty a very good movie indeed goes for all these oscars while that came out in the same period in the dutch cinemas almost remained unnoticed they deal with the same search for in suburbia but where american beauty stops goes on to unveil the real gore truth underneath all these nice neat people to confront the viewer without escape with the unimportance of existence all the while remaining funny and entertaining maybe went a bit to far for the taste of some but it didnt go any further than the next corner of the street where you live,black_comedy
solondzs sordid feature depicts a suburbaniteurbanite american community inhabited by people steeped in their own depraved and degenerate acts he presents his subject matter to the audience with extreme lucidity and a detached coolness which makes this film all the more disquieting to watcheach character in their own unique way are deluded by their desire to become happy this is where solondz works the ironic motif of the title into his narrative in their efforts to attain they become more aware of their own loneliness and alienation within the world which only serves them to sink deeper into depression there exists different degrees of selfdisillusionment through this charged web of misfits which dot the landscapes of suburbaniteurbanite america one example being the perverted computer guy who masturbates on the phone to women he is one who is resigned to defeat and appears somewhat dignified in his evident lack of desire to attain whereas on the opposite end of the spectrum we are given more complex character studies the housewife whos got it all yet she really has nothing her paedophilic husband who has a fetish for his sons friends and the author who seems to be the films winner yet we soon become aware that she is its biggest loser these characters are made all the more depraved in the sense that they hide under this veneer of middleclass normality and respectability yet they are the very epitome of all things abject it is through his characters duplicity that solondz is able to convey a caustic critique of social decayhis depiction though unsettling confronts you with a reality that you want so much to deny but are not able to is one of the best examples of how the cinema can function as a cathartic outlet it challenges and confronts you and makes you want to turn away but at the end of it all after your emotions have been nearly completely drained you are somewhat thankful that you have beared witness to a side of life in which a desperate scream for help rings true  on screen and perhaps off,black_comedy
the subject matter in which the movie dives into is a very touchy subject this movie has had and adverse effect on my life  the only people i could recommend it to are people who take nothing seriously and have a good sense of humor  i feel most people will come out of this movie thinking it is the most foul and disgusting movie ever made,black_comedy
the vignettes are often funny with a great deal of pain in this  brilliant film  this video will be hard to find as many stores refuse to put it on their shelves due to the subject matterone of the characters is a pedophile it begins with an encounter in a restaurant where jon lovitz condemns his date for wanting to break up with him  it turns out that everyone in this film is hurting in some way eventually even the wife who has it all is put into a painful situation the one character i thought was normal turns out to be a murderer  this is the blackest comedy i can ever recall seeing the film itself is very well made  if youre open minded and enjoy offbeat dark comedy check it out  its a trip,black_comedy
an ode to universal human misery and the omnipresent deviant reads almost like the first principle of buddhism all life is suffering but unlike that newly fashionable religion the film offers no consolation its darker scarier more cynical and ironic than virtually anything that came before short of greek tragedy this is an exaggeration of course still the fate of one of solondzs resident perverts a pedophile psychologist inspires the very feelings aristotle himself prescribed to tragedy pity and fear the other characters are pathetic in their own individual ways no age group or gender is overlooked some of the plot developments are indeed so disturbing that even the most desensitized members of the audience cannot help but cringe after the first ten minutes its impossible to remain unaffected yes can be an amazing experiencebut even with all of its emotional arsenalthe movie is no masterpiece the director is overly preoccupied with sheer contextual impact or shock value and seems to neglect some other cinematic ingredients esthetically the film needs to be more concisely structured and better edited to maintain its momentum the storylines are intersected at random not with the brilliant logic of pulp fiction this frequent cutting and pasting becomes confusing and the picture often looses its focus some scenes are unnecessarily lengthy their excessive pauses lessening the immediate visceral effect perhaps if solondz went back to the editing room and tightened things up a bit he would have produced a 10 regardless of its considerable flaws is a movie for our times anyone who has ever felt rejected lonely trapped or overwhelmed by powerful instincts should find much in common with its losers those of us who are more fortunate will sign with relief those who are less will be reassured that they are not alone,black_comedy
 man this movie was awesome  this is a movie that i didnt look for a deep meaning in nor am i going to comment on the cinematography or anything of that nature  i am just going to say this movie was one of the best movies i have seen in a long time  and the sole reason for this is the fact that i love showing this to my friends and watch their reactions to the good parts  and a crowd that would love this movie are fans of icp,black_comedy
in an intense character study of life in these modern complex times director todd solondz and his excellent cast of characters take you to a place that is at once both humorous and disturbing in fact you may find yourself in a quandary of not knowing whether to laugh or cry which is what makes this film so unforgetably powerful though the characters predicaments create humor and amazement by being slightly over the top at times theres a deeply haunting ring of truth in all their experiences in fact as i chuckled to myself while viewing the film i would frequently wonder if i should be laughing at all these things happen to people they happen in our society and the emotional pain they create is no laughing matter there has been controversy regarding one of the characters who has a disdainful even repugnant sexual proclivity but solondz doesnt judge his players he presents them as they are for better or worse and lets the viewer wrestle with judgmental conclusions in my opinion is certainly one of the best films of the 90s and one that no serious filmgoer should miss,black_comedy
dont be fooled be the title of this film that is what this group of troubled people are striving for to find it is another matter it is littered with an assortment of characters that seem to have sexual fetishes and perversions of some sort solondz explores some dark subjects and you would think this would make the film harsh and difficult to watch but it holds your attention throughout mainly because of the excellent performances on show especially from dylan baker as a respected doctor who holds a terrible secret and philip seymour hoffman as an obscene phonecaller and jane adams who has a calamitous love life and thinks she has met the right guy in a russian cab driver the films most powerful and emotional scene is towards the end when bakers character has a trying conversation with his son overall it is a wellacted and involving film of dysfunctional people and their problems and well worth a look,black_comedy
mr solondz is not one of us he arrived to our planet watched the humans and then put what he saw on a film that is the only explanation i can find for such an emotion and merciless objective pure view at our miseries it left me quite numblike for a week a great movie indeed,black_comedy
trying to explain the complexity of this movie to my mother shes very interested in film i had to advise her to see the movie its impossible to describe the different kind of feelings i went through seeing this movie disturbing hilarious sad even hopefull in a strange way because of the psychiatrists son all together a great experience its the great craftmanship of the director to take us along this track of laughing tears and back again the longtake shots gave the actors the room for great acting the cinema was filled with uneasy laughs including myself if you get the chance see this movie to be confronted with weakness of the people around you and yourself this only for those who have the courage to look at it that way the director had this courage so why dont we,black_comedy
because i just didnt see this movie for the masterpiece it probably is i went into this with high hopes and id like to think an open mind  but frankly i had to shut the thing off a half hour into it  this was not because of the nature of the subject matter or because i was overwhelmed or disgusted or anything like that but because nothing was happening as i said i feel terrible that my actionadventurecarchaseexplosionsandchicks mind couldnt be reached by a movie that it seems had a lot to say but then again i seriously enjoyed fight club to which this film has been compared and got a lot out of american beauty as well  perhaps the absolute desperation of and the way it seemed buried in tedious conversation and smothered by lengthy overplayed dead spots and lingering stares simply failed to capture me enough from the beginning for me to stick with it perhaps i would have been rewarded,black_comedy
last year boogie nights was snubbed at the oscars and this year it will be a brilliant movie about humanity something seldom if ever explored in film  if you find this film vulgar or shocking then youre missing the point  sure these examples are extremes but we all have our dark sides and experiences in sexuality best left unspoken  if youre sickened and depressed by it then it made some point although your ego may not have let you note itthere are no main characters you watch these people interact and find a hard time deciding who is the protagonist here  the characters are that well rounded  no one is purely bad or purely evil theyre just humani was happy to see such a graphic portrayal of people  it was all justified in the context of the story this is called character development  if youre squeamish about seeing portrayals of real people in the movies stick to michael bay or chris columbus  this movie dares to break down the barrier of sentimentality not just shock in film  what a waste that the movie industry and most of the hollywood cultured masses that attend films cant open there minds leading directors like solondz and paul thomas anderson to struggle for artistic integrity because so many people are so arrogant and fearful to look in the mirror,black_comedy
this is a darkly funny film which bravely tackles subjects that some will find difficult to deal with  although the characters are extreme and their actions unpalatable solondz forces us to confront their human frailty and ultimately our own,black_comedy
 really really odd films probably one of the oddest ive ever seen the dark humor set a mood where you didnt know whether to laugh or not it was a great film depicting a family with their strange relationships with just about everything not for the conservative mind unless one intends to change that conservative view by getting a short sharp kick to the head to be taken with a grain of salt and a lot of irony,black_comedy
this movie is the definition of disturbing it has the power to entice you and also makes you raise some interesting questions without you even knowing it should i feel sorry for this pedophile even while his actions are morally ethically and naturally wrong i liked todd solondzs welcome to the dollhouse very much but should i prefer it over just because its easier to swallow i still dont knowthe more i think about the more genius i see it as when you look at a movie like american beauty you see beautiful people trying their hardest to look ugly and use dysfunction as a trend something cool to watch in a movie thats stupid and the more i think about american beauty the more i see whats wrong with itcontains a barrel full of unhappy people whose personal stories intertwine with each others some stories are easier to take than the others and thats what is kind of funny in a way one scene youre squirming in your chair and the next you can breathe easily in relief but the easiest way to take this movie is to know its a comedy a corrosive and dark adult comedy where the laughs come nervously and you dont even know if you should laugh at what youre seeing one character i cant get out of my head that relentlessly made my skin crawl was the child molesting father played by dylan baker hes not exactly a villain yet i find him creepier than hannibal lecter thats because hes a real guy or at least a real guy played by a professional actor and what an incredible actor anyone who has the power to taunt the audience without playing some serial killer or other overplayed antagonists deserves fine raves and acknowledgement i hope dylan baker finds other great works in the near future that is if producers arent disgusted of him,black_comedy
this somewhat allenesque film concerns itself with rather bizarre family problems and pushes the envelope in dealing with taboo subjects  actually the frank sexual discussions were unnerving at times and made me uncomfortableprobably one of the points the film attempts to make  real problems like these exist in dysfunctional families that otherwise pass for normal  the toast to that occurs is ironic because all of the female characters sitting around the table have yet to find or have lost what little they thought they possessed more ironic is the fact that ben gazzaras character the only male at the table passes up his daughters offer to find someone for him might one of the messages of this film be that the males penis is its own source of ultimate that question may seem odd but once youve seen the film it will make more sense this is an interesting but somewhat strange movie  the acting is uncomfortably credible todd solondz who wrote and directed did a brilliant jobwhat might have been mere offensive caricature in less skilled hands are flesh and blood characters quite believable with a poignant story to tell the mix of humor and pathos is presented in perfect counterpoint lending lively rhythm to the films pace that is further enhanced by artful editing,black_comedy
a totally original movie and one so honest and haunting that the viewer starts thinking about his own values and prejudices twists and turns human archetypes until they resemble believable human beings which is this films greatest accomplishment it speaks out where before there was only tranquility it shows modern man as hes never been shown before as well as the complexity of modern life to manage such a confrontation takes a lot of courage so director todd solondz and the fantastic actors deserve a long applause,black_comedy
todd s is simply an amazing director  welcome to the dollhouse was a fabulous movie and is even better  this movie tells the story of some sad people  the funny thing is everyone can relate in one way or another to one of the characters  if you cant i feel sorry for you live a little  this movie has lots of humorous moments but they dont come right out and bite you  you have to use some brain cells to get some of the jokes  you must see it for yourself and absorb the movie  if you dont get it or dont think its funny watch it again im sure youll get it eventually1010,black_comedy
   in the sense that every characters interaction with every other character poisons and damages the proceedings even further for everyone involveddont consider this as a comedy or social commentary think more along the lines of a film noir like born to kill where the already damned get to dance with the almostdamned and the obliviouslydamned and a few sorry innocentsthen look at it as at least a somewhatcomedy and you might be up to speed,black_comedy
this movie does not fit into our usual notions  i would say its a comedy but that doesnt do it justice  this look in into the lives of 3 middleclass new jersey sisters and their friends neighbors and families is by turns funny insightful sad and bleakthis is the loveless world of modern america of empty materialism  and sad driven people who have few human and emotional ties people who dont know how to connect with othersits the blackest of black comedies but in a way that is profoundly nonjudgemental of its characters even the murderers and pedophiles among them the polar opposite of most hollywood movies where the black and white hats have to be clearly identified and shouldnt move to different heads we like to have heros to cheer and villains to boo  there are no clear distinctions here of who is good and who is bad a lot like life itself real people dont tend to fall into either the villain or the saint categoryi laughed really hard at this movie and felt a little guilty at  laughing at some real human sufferinggreat acting from everyone in the cast a great script great directingunfortunately a movie that got almost no big screen distribution because it was not rated it would have received an nc17 for dialogue alone  my vote a bit late for best picture of 1998,black_comedy
unreal explores the truth behind the mind of typical american everyday characters the russian sex attitude was griping and the fathers sex fetish was more typical then most would think very disturbing but brutally honest not something mainstream america could take in but something everyone should see and think about while most of you are busy watching garbage like titanic this film goes for the throat get your grandma out of bed and drag her along to the best nonaction movie of 98,black_comedy
oddly enough the store i rented this movie from had it in the comedy section  i wonder if they were trying to be funny  some parts made me laugh and some were awkward but overall i found it to be very intriguing and even watched some scenes over again just to let it all sink in  i liked the honesty of the subject matter especially between the father and son ive got a lot of questions only the characters themselves could answer what i liked best about the movie besides its risk taking was that i couldnt guess every reaction and result  i dont like movies where i can guess everyones lines and how it ends  if youre easily offended you probably wont like this movie  then again if youre easily offended you probably dont see that many movies anyway,black_comedy
a better title would have been ugliness but this is definitely a ray of hope for cinema at the end of the millenium  that there are still places we have not gone people we have not seen perversions yet to be shared and understood is new territory in what filmmakers can do and get away with it is a slow long messy film with several awkward contrivances but it also has flashes of genius  the dog licking the  the final line of the movie i came i came the psychiatrist and the bravery to let him admit f young boys was great and hed do it again the selfobsessed writer whos conceit and disdain encourages the audience to identify with her detestable neighbour to actually want him to f her  which really is a major achievement of charaterisation and positioning  to get an audience to identify with a murderer a rapist a pedophile and a whole host of other hapless hopers this film strikes a chord because it outs the world of the white lie the secret desire the dark thought the nightmare and the fantasy like freudian psychoanalysis it seeks to make the latent and the repressed real and recognised its okay to be fucked up is the element of catharsis in this film and because it is so unashamedly perverse and disturbing it is a quality experience  it either drives people out of the cinema or it makes them think and talk about issues we as a society need to talk about but rarely do except in simplified and dismissive moral cliches that let us escape the ugliness of the reality facing some people it is not condoning the subject so much as broaching it  a please consider moreso than a oh what a feeling it elicits a strong emotional response but by putting a human face to failure frustration selfhatred and sexual urges blurs the morality of our hang em alllock em up and throw away the key mentality as such is an amoral film that elicits a sophisticated selfquestioning moral response it is investigative not exploitative a comedy not a tragedy genius rather than gratuitous,black_comedy
happinessyes youll feel so happy after you see this movie if vinegar tastes like sugar to you the director was doing the shakespeare thing obviously  human beings simply cannot stand unmitigated unrelieved tragedy and therefore the comedic moment was invented  this kept people in their seats and the playwright employedfor sheer aloneness both visual and psychological this one cant be beat i have never seen so many alienated intelligent desperately unhappy people of comfortable income and decent education in one moviewhy did i know the parents lived in florida immediately  of course the pastels that exist nowhere else but in their stateordained ubiquitous interior decorating scheme  was it truly elisabeth huskyvoice of ship of foolsfrom ingenue to wreck thus go we all  how courageous of her and what a great job she didben gazzaras i feel nothing after his whambamthankyoumaam nonviagra assisted episode on the couch right on  what a great actordoing nothing playing nothing and so exquisitely  ennuithy name is ben  no one has any money problems and thats probably one of the problemssomehow the pedophile father stalking through his dreams with the machine gun blazing could not have done more harm  and the stickthin sisters obviously intelligent but sooooo ditzy  one look at the overweight jilted mom wailing and ive got to have another facelift told you why i would say that if you take comfort and delight in the misery of others as the pedophiles wife did and dont we love her comeuppance this is for you  come to think of it i liked her pederast husband much better than i did her  sure he ruined those boys including his son for life but man she was pure venom to everyone she touched   at least you could identify the harm he did  it was almost touching watching him trying to get the innocent victim to eatdrink the sleepingpotionlaced food  such a pleading look he had  and then his answers to the interrogation by his son sitting side by side on the comfortable sofa looking like a ozzie and harriet fatherson talk  his thoughtful sadfaced answers yes i did rape those boys  yes i did enjoy it yes i would do it again  no i would not do it to youi would just jack offthis is so truthful psychologists tell us pederasts are the least susceptible to rehabilitation  jail is no deterrent but they must simply be locked up forever until we find the physiological cause and detonate it chemicals only work as long as they take them  analagous to expecting the crazy homeless to take their medication  sure  the very organ that is damaged is the one expected to do the right thingthe killer fatso woman is funny so funny as she graphically describes the murder while eating  oh ill just have the chocolate fudge sundae with strawberry ice cream on top  you feel her revulsion toward having anything inside her paradox itself which is why she offed him as lovestarved as she wasto watch all these characters searching for love in all the wrong places and then rejecting it when it came for all sorts of reasons is the agonizing strain of this movie  just a tiny bit of dramatic license to make the point about the lives most of in the prosperous 90s livedo not see fight club american beauty and in sequence or youll off yourself  or better still show all three to your sunday school class  it might give the kids a hint of why ethics why integrity why faithfulness in a better dose than all the hellfire and brimstone i got as a kid  we make our own hells after all,black_comedy
i guess i cant add a great deal to the hundreds of other comments also displayed here  suffice to say that i believe that this was probably the best film of 1998 for its daring brilliant ensemble cast and unashamedly bleak view of human life and ambition  i am also quite sure i will never watch it again  i can only hope that solondz got something out of his system here because to follow down this path could mean only one thing  to make a brilliant film that nobody could stand to watch,black_comedy
this film conveys a tangible sense of the isolation modern americans feel everyday amongst their peers neighbors and even family the character studies here are captivating and the screenplay cleverly ties all of them together concerning the sensitive nature of two of the characters behavior and the reaction by watchdog groups to it the video mentioned in my summary is just the kind of fare that phillip seymour hoffmans characters illness could be fed by hypocrites,black_comedy
although this film has some uncomfortable scenes i cannot help but call it a masterpiece  giving a summary of this film would be ridiculous it has to been seen repeatedly to fully grasp whats going on if anything it should be seen for the acting alone which is astounding  a new oscar category should be created for best performance by an ensemble  it is that gooddetractors of this great film have called it grossly overrated pornographic trash about masturbation and pedophilia  those individuals are obviously missing it  although the film deals with those subjects it goes so much deeper than that  dr maplewoods confession to his son near the end has to be one of the most powerful and gutwrenching scenes i have ever witnessed on film i could go on and on but the film speaks for itself loud and clear  it is quite an amazing achievementabsolutely brilliant ,black_comedy
i was told that this movie is supposed to be funny and with that i sat down to watch it and although i was not dissapointed with it being funny it would have been nice to have some warning it was as disturbing as it was this movie took the sick  behavour of this world and made a joke out of it however it did do it in such a way that it was frowned apon instead of herald as the thing to do all in all a great movie but some prior warning as to the movies contents would have been nice,black_comedy
this movie ranks up there with in the company of men in terms of discomfort even so all the characters seem real  excruciatingly real even  the acting was wonderful throughoutaudience reaction was interesting  there were many instances of one or two people laughing loudly at a scene while the rest of the crowd was still stunned silent,black_comedy
what was is point of making this movie better yet what is the point of watching it  i am still not quite sure whether there was one  as far as i am concerned the instrument of irony or cynicism used in this movie was the only instrument used and it became rather predictable and that just killed it there was absolutely no counterweight but there may not intended to be one this is just one tragic movie of depressing grownups that are dragging children down with themsurely this is reality for some but id much rather stay home and listen my 7 year old nephew and niece telling funny stories than watching a thirteensomething boy uttering the words i came at the risk of sounding like a disney movie lets try to make the world a better place by not adding to the confusion,black_comedy
okay so i might not be able to critique as well some of the past other comments about the film but i have to suggest this film i had seen reviews saying to give this film a try when i saw it available for rent i gave it a try and wasnt disappointedthis is one film where youll be laughing out loud then also covering your face with your hands when horrified by some of the scenes you arent horrified by the graphics but by its content the scenes with the fatherson chat about not able to come very original it makes fun of the hollywood cliche of fatherson chats by talking about something completely out of left fieldthis is one of the darkest comedydramas that ive ever seen so far the sad truth is this is also reality the pedophile the thief the loser phone pranker the lonely neighbor the artist dark truths of what really does happen in society here in the states get it but this isnt for people with the faint heart or easily shocked,black_comedy
this film hurt  at times it gave me an almost physical feeling of pain because it is just a pure mirror of real life disappointment is real perversion is real lying is real ingnorance is real and superficiality is real i never saw a film except maybe welcome to the dollhouse by the same director in which fiction came so close to reality like in this film this is an american film  it shows the real american way of life more films like these are necessaryno facade no dream no fake,black_comedy
this is such an awesome brilliant film on the superficiality existential emptiness and alienation of a miscellaneous bunch of middle class characters people looking for personal mostly through sexual gratification and for the most part miserably failinghelen is a gorgeus writer who feels she lacks authenticity trish is a housewife who unknowingly has her own share of dark secrets in the family closet the characters are real and alone with their urges and many needs and theyre  depicted very realistically battling with their many needs wishes and insecurities the fact is that  people portrayed in this film really do exist probably each of us shares some sort of deviation or a sexual predilection the motley crew of the films characters is quite credible the vanities the sillyness the lack of control over ones own life and circumstances is universal amongst members of humanity yet this obsessive strife for and ease is often leading us to greater unand unease imperative for especially without content instant gratification is the illness of the modern man and this condition todd solondz presents in this funny intelligent film with fine control style and competence he firmly holds all the different threads in his grip and even manages to portray the russian crook played by jared harris and his family with such correspondence to reality brilliant film about the nonsensicalities of human existenceuplifting,black_comedy
i laughedthen i laughed hystericallythen i wincedthen i cringedand then i laughed againthere arent many movies that can make me do all that in one settingnuff said,black_comedy
the correct pronunciation of this films title should involve the stressed enunciation of its latter two syllables it is the clandestine penis in lurking comically within the confines of such a disarming title that exemplifies the darkly ironic humor employed in this filmsolondz and his cast do an incredibly good job portraying the layered perversities enabled by modern life the head of a cleaveresque family is revealed as a pedophile the nice lady down the hall uses a cleaver to remove a mans head and then files pedro away in her freezer  the starlet author whos got it all except for a rapist to lend authority to her victimizationladen poetry the boring data analyst who leads a double life as a selfabusing telephonic don juan etci found to be a wonderfully crafted spoof of the haplessness of modern life the film is hardly uplifting though and will probably leave even those who latch on to its ironic brand of humor feeling a bit empty at the end kind of like a onenight stand,black_comedy
very interesting movie controversial and open in terms of recognizing characteristics our nature does not provide solutions or happy endings there are several difficult and conflicting situations like pedophilia and other sexual deviations from norm they are presented in a somewhat cold but seemingly real way good acting i would add that you then wonder if what you see is the symptom of our society problems or if it just what it may be sick people probably the truth lies in between  one could ask if the society provide channels to individuals to properly develop their sexuality,black_comedy
with the levels of explicit violence soaring in films it is encouraging to see that the most shocking film of the year only talks about its depths of depravity  the father and son talk towards the end of the film is extraordinarily brave and cancels any suspicions that solondz might be unable to back up his shocks with any valuable insights  his treatment of paedophilia is sad sensitive and frightening yet he even manages to draw some comedy from it  it sounds sick and twisted when described like this but it is very powerful on the screen,black_comedy
i dont usually write movie reviews but i felt like i must express my feelings about this movie  its shocking questionevoking and probably one of the best movies i have ever seen in my entire lifetimethe scenes are so aesthetic  as if it were a comic strip the colors are usually bright and highly contrasted and the entire atmosphere the movie projects is very calm and happy indeed yet the actual content of the film itself isnt quite as calm and happy as the film appears to be the ugliness and twistedness of every character is being revealed sometimes immediately sometimes shortly after we meet the character the movie is comprised of sensations dialogues and experiences the characters go through and the structure of the movie is perfectall this technical perfection that the movie seems to be full of is only a coverup just like the coverups the characters in the movie itself all have they all make up lies and surround themselves by walls sometimes even involuntaryi recommend this movie to anyone whos not overshocked by certain extreme aspects of society and subsocietyand dont watch it with your parents,black_comedy
embarrassment is the most vital factor of every good movie nothing is more frustrating for the viewer than characters you would like to relate to that just dont seem to cope with everyday social events like talking take the scorching opening scene of this film for instancei probably have never seen a film which made me feel so ashamed for the actions of the characters in the story is a comedy but the only time you laugh is out of embarrassment with what you get to seeall main characters are in some way damaged or distorted with as a poignant zenith the paedophile familyman the final scene with this man and his son is without a doubt the most stressing and oppressing scene ever put to filmwhen i left this film i immediately noticed i was looking in a different way at people passing on the street everybody has a secret life but nobody ever tells in its the only thing you see the secret life of seemingly normal people it is the perfect example of what you never want to become and although a few of the many characters in this film are not really that believeable and real there is enough sickness embarrassment stress and psychological suspence to make a wonderfully embarrassing movie about life,black_comedy
a fabulous film about sick minds and funny as well which is really disturbing i guess the 97 other comments can make clear what the film is all about good more than good acting an intelligent script and that makes easily one of the best films of 1998 if you enjoyed festen the celebration then you should certainly check this one out and vice versa,black_comedy
i browsed through the user comments and im surprised how some people cant accept a movie thats both funny and disturbing i understand if this movie fails to make sense to those people i thought was one of the most daring original and moving american films ive seen in a long time it was over too soon i wanted to find out more are you as i am tired of hollywoodformula filmmaking the bythenumbers brain dead action horror whateverfilms see this movie if you have an open mind and want something different ill give it 4 out of 5 and check out welcome to the dollhouse as well another brilliant film,black_comedy
todd solondz is one of those movies that some people might find disturbing and some people might find sad or depressing i didnt find it either onethe film follows some very odd characters who lead very unusual lives theres a stalker an obsessivecompulsive writer and even a child molester the story is basically about them trying to find in a weird way ive seen it done better on the surface these characters deliver dialogue that is supposed to shock you below the surface is a script trying to pull you in to identify with these charactersi couldnt identify with them at alli was not offended by any of the bizarre events in this movie i laughed quite a bit in some places and although i felt a little guilty about one subject i still managed to churn out a laughtodd solondz does have a bright future ahead of him his script is rather witty and in a morbid way funny where he fails is trying to give his characters life i couldnt agree with anyone in this picture not because of their actions but by poor character development its like he wrote out all of these weird scenarios and forgot to give any of his characters depth some might find what they say deep enough but for me i need to know more like how did they become the way they are or why how about a little background info no dicesometimes its not what happens to a character or what a character says that makes you sad its what a character doesnt dodeveloprating 45 out of 10,black_comedy
this independent film is a soap opera that dares to tread in some heretofore unexplored places  loosely it follows a dysfunctional family through a variety of perverse situations  theres a lot of masturbation as well as other types of scenes played for shock value and lots of twists and turns to the plot theres also some incredibly good acting and directinghowever the director todd solondz  didnt seem to quite know whether to play this film for comedy or pathos and most of it is not funny just sick and depressing  it moves too slow and is too long and even though the characters are interesting theyre cardboard cartoon sorry versions of human beings  like other recent independent films small parts are played by name people ben gazarra louise lasser and marla maples none of their performances are noteworthy  however the rest of the cast is excellentinteresting but not memorable and certainly not for everyone,black_comedy
just hearing the name todd solondz urged me to see this film that explores all of the facets of sexual depravitymost commonly malesand causes you to feel remorse for what we in the present world call monsters  dylan baker plays the ultimate father knows bestwho just happens to be a pedophile that molests his sons young male friends  what is largely ironic about this film is that is apparently nowhere to be found within itinstead we view this coated layer of self induced lies that normal citizens envelop themselves in for protection  jon lovitz has a great cameo at the begining of the film that shows he can play more than just goofy comedic roles  this movie is definitely for an art oriented crowdand not a recommended date movieunless you plan on breaking up with your loved one,black_comedy
i dont care how you feel about this movie it stinks but the entire cast should be brought up on child abuse charges justin elvin looks to be about eleven or twelve years old his birth date isnt listed anywhere i can find in this movie and the conversations he has  not to mention the lines the boy himself speaks in this movie  are criminal then to top it off they have the boy standing outside on a balcony looking at a woman in a bathing suit while he simulates masturbation along with heavy breathing etc later his own father admits to him that he raped two of his classmates and that he jerks off over his son where the heck were this boys parents maybe they are the ones to be reported to child services if any one of the conversations with this child were to happen in real life it would be grounds for child abuse  but not in hollywood very sad indeed this isnt art it is shameful,black_comedy
do not see this film this movie is not only disturbing it is disgusting and horrendous i found nothing redeeming funny or intriguing about pedophilia and fat men masturbating the movie has no story line of value unless you can find a plot in watching a man sodomize his sons friend i saw this movie two years ago on tape i was tricked by the box into believing the movie was funny and full of humor once i saw the child molestation scene i realized how depraved the producers of this film are they should be embarrassed there are big names in this film why they would make a movie as disgusting as this is baffling,black_comedy
im being absolutely as sincere as possible when i say this this was the worst film i have ever seen  i am not conservative or squeamish in any way but there is a fine line between good and provocative art and art that deliberately tries to be different and they missed the bullseye and hit crude instead  this depicts nothing that people can relate to  except maybe masturbation  the people that liked this movieperhaps you should ask yourself why,black_comedy
child molestation infidelity ad infinitum the movie was poorly written woodenly acted and cobbled together for the sole purpose of wallowing in human depravity about all i got from this movie is that todd solondz believes people suck i already knew thatgo refill your prozac and rent his brilliant welcome to the dollhouse instead if you want a bleak depressingly realistic view of life in the new jersey burbssince imdb does not value brevity the only thing left to say about this movie is if you enjoy watching horror movies that are psychological rather than physical you might enjoy this movie,black_comedy
then im getting a new hobby or not watching movies anymore im all for a sickdisturbed plot andor dialogue to an extent but come onthis movie just goes way too far for way too long it really made me uncomfortable watching it and dont tell me you didnt get the point because i really couldnt see anything positive to bring from this movie im even more surprised this has a 77 rating i usually relate to most voters here at imdb but i was fooled by this one i rarely comment on movies anymore but i felt compelled to write my 2 cents on this one i cant imagine someone actually putting up money to produce it i wonder if the fans of this movie are just as fd up as the characters then i can understand if you relate as for me this movie is just garbage,black_comedy
this is a real clinker of a movie it is certainly not for the squeamish among usthis story of a dysfunctional family puts the word dysfunctional over the top in most dictionarieswe dont have to be reminded that a psychiatrist could be a child molester and that camryn manheim who really throws her weight around on screen could have killed a doorman and chopped his body into piecesthere is one solid performance and that belongs to jane adams as the youngest sister who appears to be the biggest loser of them all unlucky in forming solid relationships she falls for a russian cab driver who is out to get her money as she did in her oscar nominated supporting performance in junebug miss adams pulls out all the emotional stops here as well she will be the next joanne woodward as she matures in films she evokes plenty of frustration and emotional turbulence in her roles its just the poor quality of this film that does her in,black_comedy
a film completely lacking any kind of interesting plot development or storyline this sort of thing seems to be popular lately making films that are in reality about nothing but contain a great deal of shocking scenes and bits intended to make the audience feel uncomfortable if this was the intention with then the writerdirector succeeded marvelously what was completely lacking was a movie was not an interesting story the audience feels no empathy for any of the characters who are for the most part disgustingly perverse andor completely selfabsorbed and obnoxious furthermore as a dark comedy about lifes realities the film falls short again portraying everyday people as pedophiles jeffrey dahmer style murderers ignorant housewives perverted crank callers beautiful and selfabsorbed writers and weak minded doormats for abusive boyfriends and family members none of the scenes intended to be funny are actually funny does little more than shock and disgust with many of the most disgusting scenes being completely unnecessary to the film in short a complete waste of over two hours and three bucks,black_comedy
although a well made and emotionally engaging film left me with such a bad and lingering after taste that i would hesitate to recommend to anyone  the title is supposed to be ironic as none of the characters could be described in any way as happy neurotic depressed and perverted all come to mind but never happy rather than go into detail about the plot or detail id prefer to discuss the reasons i disliked this filmfirstly its so obviously trying to be shocking or provocative one character is a paedophile another makes obscene phone calls there are several masturbation scenes etc secondly the film just offers up these characters and their actions without comment which compared to the kind of blatant moralizing that most hollywood films seem to be so fond of should come as a relief instead it seemed to me that solondzs goal was to lead the audience into identifying with characters in order that they may be more thoroughly appalled by the characters actions later onas i said the apparent absence of moralizing should come as a relief but instead this film just left me feeling empty and sad  yes it did make me think but mostly it made me think about how i already know there are sad and sick people in the world and that i dont need some pretentious directorwriter to tell me that paedophiles are people too the popularity of this film seems to rest on its willingness to deal with controversial issues  however it seems to me that by refusing to address the events depicted on any moral grounds whatsoever this film ends up saying nothing at all,black_comedy
thensophomore director todd solondz was extremely lucky to have the teenalienation sleeper welcome to the dollhouse under his belt as it gave him the opportunity to waste 139 minutes of my life with a pompous pretentious sideshow of dull caricatures and banal dialog called for the most part this criticfriendly controversytailored film chugs along with incredible indifference or disdain toward its characters which range from gardenvariety losers a fat unhappy woman an obscene phonecaller etc to coldly detached society types including a female author who has lost faith in her work and a psychiatrist who is also a pedophile the feeling of overwhelming futility in the dialog is hard to shake thus making it really hard to give a damn about any of these people if this was a deliberate tactic solondz certainly didnt wield it successfully the pastelcolored misanthropy and hopelessness that pervades is little more than nihilistic shock for shocks sake i have no issue with the extremes of human emotion being given an outlet through film but is appalling in its own shrugging passivity only one story thread truly inspires awe and disquiet of any lasting merit the pedophile psychiatrist brilliantly played by character actor dylan baker who drugs and molests his sons friends during sleepoversthis is the only time finds an endearing emotional pulse perhaps because of the intimacy with which its handled the exchanges between baker and his son are awkward and at one point devastating had centered on this strongyet instantly unmarketableplot it might have been a truly mature and disturbing production as it stands it is backed up with too many worthless characters you could care less about and dialog that confuses simplism with genius,black_comedy
i see much has been said about this film however i didnt find anything praiseworthy in it it was just a very ordinary overrated pointless waste of my timethe plot is basically about various people i didnt care about with boring ordinary problems masturbation and a father who apparently raped some children with nothing obvious shown anywhere about the incidences  possibly included in an attempt to be provocative  which just plays out so dullthe dialog towards the start of the film sums this movie up for me where a guy is talking to a shrink about how boring he issigh,black_comedy
is the only film that i have seen of todd solonz so i cant say that this is his masterpiece but still for me this is must see for film fansis like three different films any of this films whit a sister as the main character joy helen and trish they are looking for the joy is trying to be a musician helen is a very successful writer but still she is not happy and trish that is a house wife that appears to be very happy but the less communication whit his sick husband is going to have very bad resultsamazing and very clever screenplay that have strong themes like pedophiliastrong sexual content that makes that this film is not for every oneas a conclusion this film have very clever points and also a little touch of irony and comedy contains a very good point of view about the search of in a middle class society that appears have it alldvd i have the signature dvd and is really good whit few bonus material but still good,black_comedy
this jawdroppingly black comedy for such it is more or less can make you laugh out loud and screw your eyes away in horror at almost the same moment yet its not just about shock effects the apparently fearless todd solondz has made a real movie here with real characters no matter how depraved and it is the skill intelligence and precision of his approach that give the discomfort and the laughs that rare quality a true edge if you can imagine some bizarre collaboration between luis bunuel r crumb and middleperiod woody allen you might get an idea of what youre in for hereas with bunuel solondz detached yet avid attention focuses less on condemnation than on watching what his characters do next it isnt good hoffman as a shy inarticulate loner releases his sexual frustration in abusive phone calls adams as a sadeyed idealistic musician floats from mishap to mishap like a semideflated balloon  never rising yet never quite sinking either baker playing a tortured familymantherapistpedophile turns to predation the sequences involving this last character constitute the movies most queaseinducing thread yet bakers extraordinary performance and that of the young actor rufus read as his son make their scenes heartbreaking as well it should be noted that the cast all around is excellent down to brief but memorable work by jon lovitz and camryn manheimsolondz never softens every time you think you sense a turn for the better in the whole business something rape murder suicide theft screws up the works but the movie is ultimately about as both the title and the endearingly drippy song adams performs remind us  how fleeting it is and how difficult to attain and yet how transfiguring even when it passes us by i have not yet watched solondzs other works but i was impressed enough by the assurance of this one to seek them out moviemaking as good as this is worth squirming for,black_comedy
this one will knock your socks off even if you arent wearing any socks i dare you to watch it i doubledare youbut first a few words this is about sex not your cinderella meets prince charming sex not your boy meets girls sex at all or not exactly this is more like real sex the kind you dont talk about this is about several varieties of sex most of them perverted or deviant andor illegal in most states and this is about in only the most ironic sense of the wordyet somehow this movie seemswell not uplifting heaven forbid but somehow reassuring in a strange way i guess what happens is that after all the perversions the hangups the unrequited desires the bizarro fantasies the unnatural desires the depraved acts the exploitation the sheer desperation of the biological imperative somehow with the family sitting around the dinner table at the end somehow we are reassured that life not only goes on but things could be worseit is interesting that director todd solondzwho previously gave us the captivating and totally original welcome to the dollhouse 1995 a strikingly truthful look at the middle child in junior high schoolspun this out the way he did the story is really about three sisters and their parents and the dysfunctional sex that they encounter and the pitiable normal lives they live solondz could have begun with having us meet the sisters one by one like some kind of chick flick with the expectation that we will find out about their lives and their loves instead he starts from another angle and only gradually does it develop that this really is about their lives and loveswell their lives and loves are a bit beyond kinky or pathetic and yet they are so very like the lives and loves so many people leadif only we knew by the way at times the film is belly laugh funnystarring are jane adams joy lara flynn boyle helen and cynthia stevenson trish as the three sisters joy is the wallflower at the dance of life helen is the hard as a stiletto woman of fashion accomplishment and beauty who cant find the right man and trish is the desperate housewife happily married to a man who is a homosexual pedophile and a psychiatrist dylan baker plays the shrink who cant help himself in a way that makes it tough for the audience not to identify with his problem he is so honest with his son and so clearly loves his son and his wife that we are almost won over almost we do not see him with the boys he exploits and in this way perhaps solondz has stacked the deck still a movie that paints a pedophile in anything close to a positive light deserves credit for courage if nothing elsethe other characters who are anything but sympathetic in an objective assessmentone is a murderersomehow come across as being vulnerable instead of monstrous perhaps joy who is so hopeful and so very very vulnerable is the one who most inspires our sympathy the russian who frankly admits hes a thief and exploits joy seems more despicable than anyone in the film perhaps i think it really depends on your point of view your sexuality and perhaps your individual experienceben gazzara is the father who is just sick of his wife and louise lasser whom i havent seen since she starred in the offbeat tv sit com mary hartman mary hartman from the seventies plays the wife philip seymour hoffman plays a guy who is terrified of performing with women but gets his jollies dialing strangers on the phone and talking dirty camryn manheim plays the large woman who wants intimacy but finds sex disgustingi think youve got the picture this is sexual dysfunction as tvs lifetime would never have it solondzs intent seems to be to demonstrate the truth of the adage to know all is to forgive all he also does a good job of showing that although we think we are the self that makes the decisions maybe it is true that our biology overrides our intentionsthis is decidedly not for the straitlaced or the intolerant this the sort of movie that is so terrifying to social conservatives that they wont even attack it for fear that such an attack would only give it greater currencysee this for todd solondz who is a film maker of verve and insight a humanist who is not afraid to shock the bourgeoisienote over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book cut to the chaise lounge or i cant believe i swallowed the remote get it at amazon,black_comedy
this is the excellent movie john waters wishes he could make if he only had the talent it has all the ingredients of a jw movie perversion satire of the middle class sexual deviancy etc this fascinating and sometimes hilarious film is not so much about the human condition as pretentious critics like to say as it is about the subhuman condition most characters if not all are either depraved deeply neurotic egotistical or just plain insane and most of them are entirely pathetic some idiots dismiss this as shock cinema much in the way they would dismiss howard stern as a mere shock jock but that is a big mistake this movie has more basis in reality than most of the acclaimed respected dramas made by the likes of spielberg van sant or reiner combinedfirst of all the film is undoubtedly funny secondly the characterizations are excellent  very well fleshedout thirdly the dialogues are fresh and original fourthly how many satirescomedies can last over two hours without being boring fifthly there are many surprising and clever character developments plus the photography is a rather nice bonus obviously the most outrageous deviancy is the psychiatrist who offers to show his son how to masturbate and later drugsrapes his sons friend this was certainly on the brink of bad taste but it was done in such a way that the pedophile dad was funny which is a pretty amazing accomplishment its hard to make a character as despicable as that appear so comical and pathetic the urgency anxiety and excitement with which he prepares the tuna sandwich for the gay boy is an example of this but the funniest scene is when seymour collapses into the arms of the fat female neighbour and rants about wanting pussy though not hers just for the record these are some of the things that occur in the movie either as spoken imagined or actual spreekilling pedophilia rape of a drugged minor murder and mutilation theft of a stereo and a guitar masturbation of an adult masturbation of a boy sperm hitting a wall sperm hitting a balcony a dog licking human semen sexabuse over the phone suicide rape of a fat woman by a nearmidget and vomiting the more conservative less openminded andor squeamish viewers may want to vomit themselves but all of this isnt as extreme as it sounds things are mostly spoken of or suggested  the rest is left to the unwilling imagination the only complaint i might have is that jarred harris is in this though his character is  thank god  quite marginal the talentless fluke that he is he plays a russian with an italian accent seymour an actor i dont particularly like is actually quite good as the sexuallyfrustrated ugly guy another standout is jane adams as the failureinsecure woman but the most perfect casting is dylan bakers he plays the pedophile but looks like a young version of jimmy carter from the maker of welcome to the dollhouse,black_comedy
maybe this movie will appeal to some but i surmise from the review on the front page that its a narrow set that likes to think they like good independentsill take the word for it that it discusses unsettling aspects of our culture  and from tv guides review it seemed like a mustsee for todays culture i wouldnt know because i had to stop watching i dont know how anyone can find it funny if the subject matters what it is i shudder to see the comedy of it all its certainly important and long overdue but i wish it were presented in a more interesting package,black_comedy
different aspects of todd solondzs film remind one of other movies for its overall structure and the presence of philip seymour hoffman in the cast one thinks of paul thomas andersons magnolia the portrait of dysfunctional families in suburbia brings to mind the films of mike leigh and hal hartley the literally seminal humour is a far stronger version of that in theres something about mary or american pie while the general comedy of embarrassment and subject material that includes paedophilia has parallels in the work of chris morris of course when a film reminds one of so many others that means that either it is hopelessly derivative or as is happily the case for this movie a true original the films opening credits conclude with the announcement of its title with a splendid comic timing that tells you from the start that the meaning of the word is wholly ironic and that therell be no joy for its antonymouslynamed heroine the overall effect is overthetop but when even supposedly satirical films like american beauty and donnie darko chose to put a certain gloss on their portrait of the american suburbs a film as brutal as this one serves as a certain refreshing antidote its not flawless its a little too set up to shock and because of this lacks the depth to really sustain its length and some of the humour pushes the boundaries of comedy beyond whats truly funny in fact some of the best moments are the gentler ones like when dippy joy sings her ode to on acoustic guitar its probably a good thing that all movies arent this extreme but its certainly one film youre unlikely to forget in a hurry,black_comedy
todd solondz may as well be projecting a mirror onto the silver screen like with welcome to the doll house this movie was to real for me to enjoy i actuly saw this on video mainly because of the bright red sticker that said warning contains material that may offend i thought that it probobly had some dick jokes in it or something there were scenes in this movie that made me so uncomfortable minor spoilers like the father and son talks where you have no idea how to feel i found myself laughing just to escape the tension ditto with the scene in helens living room so uncomfortable i cant stand iti cant recomend this movie enough but it sticks in your mind for days like i said in my review i give it 1010 but i watch movies to escape from my reality and forget for a few minutes that every thing is so fked,black_comedy
these movies are sick and pointless  there were maybe 4 laughs between the 2 of them  yes they show things that can happen and do but who cares there is no entertainment value and there is nothing to learn from them a big fat 0,black_comedy
i dont normally write comments on the movies i watch there are so many comments written on this site but i found it necessary to make my voice heard i am an extremely openminded movie viewer mild spoilers ahead but please continue readingas an aspiring director i understand that ugliness and sadness are two very powerful emotions to use to get your point across this film indeed shows the vile and disgusting sexual habits of people however it makes no attempt to justify what is seen nor does it come to any conclusion concerning the sick and twisted habits from domestic abuse pedophilia the desire to be raped and other human ugliness has easily become the worst movie i have ever seenever when it was finished i actually had to sit and talk to my friends and explain why this film bothered me so much just so i could carry on with my day i have seen american history x magnolia american beauty platoon full metal jacket apocalypse now and agree that they are all in their own right excellent films they are excellent because they display the ugliness and depravity of our nature but in the end explain its absurdity i dare say goes on to glorify it the director spends so much time depicting the raping of a small boy that i wonder how these child actors were effected by this role i wonder how people can sleep at night having decided that this is quality cinema the concept of watching a man seduce an adolescent on film and come to no moral justification is so beyond my scope of rationality that i honestly would punch the director int he face if i saw him is sick twisted and contributing to the demise of our world i have never felt more passionately about my hate for a film it is complete at utter garbageon a side note the musical score was weak at best the plot line is terrible the director has strange unexplainable scenes and cuts and the actors take so long to say their lines i could go make a snack before any serious dialogue is accomplished,black_comedy
this movie was not very good the writer seemed like he was trying to make it as disturbing and disgusting as he possibly could you would honestly have to be completely sick to actually enjoy watching this movie sure it may have its moments in humor but that doesnt make it a good or even a half way decent movie you hear enough about stuff that goes on in this movie all day on the news so why you would even bother to watch thisafter youve already seen its entire plot on msnbc foxnews law and order etc regardless of its plot the actual subjects discussed in the dialogue throughout the movie are to put it subtly grotesque please dont support things like this in hollywood because it really is bothersome to some people who have been in these situations to hear about movies completely fictional or truetolife that involve the horrors that plague their memories and lives till its end,black_comedy
this movie wallowed in the downside of our nature  there was no affection for the characters  i felt the director wanted me to sit next to him and snicker at all the lowly people that exist on this planet i know there are pedophiles i know there are lonely women i know there are homicidal people i know there are crank callers who masturbate get the picture the director informed me of nothing new nor did he have world view that picquied me interest ill remember the directors name to be sure i never see another movie he directs with such vemon against humanity,black_comedy
it is dark and it is funny so it does what it was aiming for excellent acting by everyone it talks about weird and disturbing stuff but it never really shows anything so it kinda leaves it to your twisted imagination then again its just humans doing human things intertwining stories of bunch of people struggling in their lives,black_comedy
another top 10 of all time movies in my opinion the subject matter sexual dysfunction may not be easy for some to take however it is enlightening and just over the top as far as acting and emotional impact you feel like you are hit by a train decades later it still stands out in my mind,black_comedy
first off this movie is well put together and i really enjoyed the acting as far as the film itself i would not recommend this if you have any problems mentally or go though crap in real life there are funny bits and the film goes smooth but i highly see this movie causing some folks to be depressed alot and this movie is not for the analytical minded person,black_comedy
if you are interested in a comedy about inferiority loneliness masturbation stalking divorce pedophelia and rape then this is the movie for youthis is one cheery movie all about family values it is a story about people who long to connect with eachother but struggle to understand eachother and therefore unfortunately are alone together director todd solondz has the unique ability to irritate the movie masses because he dares hold up a mirror to all the hypocrisy of pretending to be better than you are todd solondz dares to film all those taboos that are never shown in the hollywood movies for the masses thats why todd solondzmovies dont sell very well but nevertheless are regarded as classics amongst filmcritics and moviegeeksthe movies by todd solondz are always about losers psychiatrically disturbed people who loathe themselves and he makes us laugh about those twisted human shortcomings that can ruin relationships and families in real life those ruined relationships and psychiatric illnesses are not funny at all but in he makes comedy out of misery in a brilliant way that is to say if you like black comedies otherwise you will be bored or offended or both acting is great magnificent performance by philip seymour hoffman he is just hilarious the story more or less starts with him being a phone stalker he is depicted as a truly perverted evil man at the beginning but as the story progresses more and more normal people around him seem to be even more disturbed than he is in the end the phone stalker is relatively speaking the most sane and innocent of the whole bunch of characters that are seriously mentally ill it may sound horrible to be able to laugh about so many human shortcomings but it truly is a cheery movie and brilliant because not many directors can or dare to portray those shorcomings no one dares talk aboutlovely and hilarious soundtrack with a great end track by michael stipe from rem which was specifically written for this movie,black_comedy
and i argue it is one of the top five films of the 1990s others have said what needs to be said,black_comedy
this is a subversively dark yet sometimes funny movie that on the surface seems to deal with a bunch of pathetic losers those losers however simply turn out to be every day people dealing with their own bouts of loneliness obsession and quiet desperation though we dont know it at the start most of the principal characters all belong to a single family handling their neuroses in the best way they can without making much progress an odd aspect of the film is that it takes a look at human frailties that lead their characters into various forms of depravity without making a moral judgment leaving that pretty much up to the viewer for that reason there will be those who abhor the picture and those who may take away some meaningful insight dylan baker as the tortured psychologist bill maplewood is a case in point his portrayal is probably just a bit too candid for most folks and quite frankly i didnt see any credibility in his frank discussion about sexual abuse and masturbation with his own son maybe im nave but id bet if there were one in a million parents like him discussing such a personally depraved topic while implicating himself in a crime then i just dont comprehend human nature ditto for kristina camryn manheim laying bare her slice and dice of pedro the doorman to neighbor allen philip seymour hoffman on the flip side allens behavior as a serial phone call abuser seemed all too credible and i dont doubt there are any number of perverts like him running around getting their kicks anonymously the best that can be said about the film is that each of the players effectively demonstrate their own failures as human beings while striving for their own definition of elusive as that may be among the principal cast members theres really no one who evokes enough sympathy to be considered a good guy or gal so ultimately a happy ending is deemed inconclusive one surprise in the picture though was the appearance of the real estate agent who showed mona jordan louise lasser an apartment id never seen marla maples in a picture before and her identity eluded me until i looked up her credit for the film here it made me wonder if her exhusband donald trump ever saw this picture,black_comedy
ive always enjoyed despite asking myself why i ever bothered to watch it after every single viewing yes the title is deliberately ironic as there is barely a trace of anything vaguely happy in the entire mover but then it knows that its safe to say that is definitely not a feelgood film and you really do need to know what youre in for before you sit down to invest over two hours with this manic depressive beast of a moviei suppose you could call it an ensemble piece as there are numerous characters all woven together around the three central characters who are sisters all at various stages of adulthood and doing their best to either live with whats become their lot in life or desperately try to change it its basically a family drama but with a few  very  dark helpings of black humour however the overriding thing to say about is that it deals with the worst themes you can probably think of and presents them in a way that forces you to think about those who its easy to despise without a second thought therefore you dont just have to be in the mood for something depressing but also something that really goes into areas of human nature that you would probably not like to dwell on most notably child abuseis a film that will certainly leave an impact on you even if its just you swearing you will never watch something like that again however for all the darkness and realism it presents i have watched it about three times and i think its a worthy film the performances are all excellent youd be hard put to it to find a weak link among the cast phillip seymour hoffman is naturally excellent but perhaps the hardest role falls to dylan baker who plays possibly one of the most bizarrely relatable child molesters youve ever met it must have been a horrible role for him and he plays it to perfectionlike i say dont expect feelgood and get ready for a rough ride but if youre in the mood for something as deep as this it will certainly make you wonder whos sitting opposite you and what goes on behind the faade of familyfriendly life,black_comedy
is a film of sheer audacity intellect and brilliance yet one that takes the cinema to depths that the mainstream would never attempt director todd solondz takes the viewer on an extraordinary journey and its incredibly profound amusing and most certainly unforgettable he makes punchlines out of misery and pedophilia while eventually arriving at a touching and tragic vision of humanity it is distressing and utterly hilarious at the same time and the performances across the board are simply fantastic is an ensemble piece of five different stories all of which intersect from time to time the film concerns the lives of several related new jersey residentsa sexually frustrated professional philip seymour hoffman a pedophile psychologist dylan baker his blissfully delusional wife cynthia stevenson their 11yearold son rufus read whos concerned with his inability to ejaculate an unhappy older couple ben gazzara louise lasser and others selfcenteredness is the chief characteristic of nearly everyone in this filmat two hours and 20 minutesrambles a bit but the strength of these characters is undeniable the film strongly benefits for thoroughly realized characters and relationships along with solondzs masterful ability to switch the tone from comic to tragic at the drop of a dime we experience empathy for the kind of people we would ordinarily feel uncomfortable around solondz does not judge his characters he doesnt excuse them and he doesnt reduce them to wicked villains or victims he simply sees them and he invites us to do the same,black_comedy
i read many reviews on this movie prior to seeing it i went in with low expectations i am all for the dark comedy that i consider cerebral films i often encounter movies that i consider cerebral either for the subject matter andor directorial stylesadly i went in with the expectation that this was a serious and dark film with questionable subject matter i do like viewing that type of film but i do a get ready type of mental prep to get ready to view that type of filmnot very far into the film i was laughingnot just once or twice but often in this film it is a comedy albeit a dark one those that reviewed this film with a disgust factor missed the point the scenes were so over the top one couldnt help but laugh at how ludicrous they were please do not go into this film with a frame of mind of this is all meat and no fat you will miss the point of this funny and original piece,black_comedy
challenging films are films that when watched with an open mind usually tend to impress me and make me feel entertained in a way perhaps you dont normally get from any other film i admire films that arent afraid to let their quirkyness and originality stand out and the films of todd solondz are no exception to this aspect i love to the deepest descent that he manages perfectly too have the ability to present us with the most outrageous shocking and even in this case controversial situation but at the same time gives us an extraordinary and moving piece that we cant forget whether we like it or not so loving the films of todd solondz i came into hoping for the best although if youve heard anything about the film it may be enough to scare you away it almost did methe thing that makes so outrageous and controversial is too many the pedophile aspect but also perhaps how in the end we feel a strange sense of sympathy and even sorrow for a character like him or an obscene phone caller even for a dirty old man leaving his wife for younger women doesnt glorify these ordeals but instead in a very twisted sort of way kind of sort of turn them in to a joke the kind where you dont know if its okay to laugh and if you do you feel even worse manages to give us a devilishly indulging time that honestly some would do best to avoid however i must say its a film you dont really want to admit to yourself that youre enjoying so much seeing how in certain scenes you cant help but feel pretty darn disturbed the delicious diabolical humor is absolutely awesome i like the feeling of that sort of uncomfortable humor they strongly use in this filmthe film deals with the lives of three sisters so in a way the film is three different stories the first deals with helen lara flynn boyle whose neighbor is an obscene phone caller who says sexual slurs in the calls to express his lonely sexual desire and even repression the film gives this character played perfectly by phillip seymour hoffman an extremely fragile soul whom we want to see succeed and find his it gets even tragically sweet at times the second sister joy is the somewhat down on her luck one she stills lives with her parents who are in the middle of a separation and isnt entirely open to love i must say jane adams gives a great performance however i didnt really feel all that much sympathy or compassion for her perhaps because she really didnt come as a person who deals with a lot then there is trish who is the perfect stay at home wife and her scenes are the scenes that will disturb you seeing how her husband bill played all too tragically realistic by dylan baker is secretly a pedophile perhaps her life does focus more on bill as does the film and the film doesnt shy away from the ugly truth its very disturbing when his pedophile side comes out such as when he talks to his sexually curious son billy however honestly underneath it all its sort of hard for us the audience to admit that we have a hidden liking towards him the guilty part of it all is how we the viewer are repulsed disturbed but yet ironically indulged in the film you cant look away even if you want too but you cant unless youre like mega sensitive towards kids or whatever he actually is a good dad even though it may have been his pedophile side talking but we cant help but feel a small when his son owns up to him the way he doesthe direction and writing is extraordinary and even better the performances are brilliant i love how each woman manages to each give a different stand out performance and stay true to their characters as does everybody else in the film i must say i also really admired the acting from the very brave roles such as billy rufus read bill dylan baker and kristina camryn manheim it took guts to take on such roles and why they or anybody else in this film didnt get oscar nominations or recognition is beyond meoverall im going to say one thing only about this film although extraordinary and very wonderful its a movie that is not i repeat not for everybody i would only recommend it if you are aware of some of todd solondz other deep meaning films such as palindromes or storytelling than youll have an idea of what youd get in too i also strongly recommend to those who love films that challenge you or that youre not afraid to be felt uncomfortable or even disturbed by a films dramatic subject matter is a truly magnificent little film sure very uncomfortable but its disturbingness i think just enhances to the experience and even enjoyment of this film for those who like that kind of thrill from films,black_comedy
this is certainly not a happy film it will turn a lot of people off because of the subject matterit deals with the underbelly of life we meet andy jon lovitz who is being dumped by joy jane adams one of three sisters he doesnt take it wellwe next meet the boring allen philip seymour hoffman who is describing his sexual fantasies to his psychiatrist bill dylan baker the other sister helen lara flynn boyle is the object of allens attraction he is afraid to speak to her bill fantasizes about walking through the park killing people and masturbates in his car to teen magsthe office scene after joy learns about andys death was a riot he actually worked in her office for a year but no one remembered himbill drugs his whole family so he can molest his sons rufus read friendyou could go on and on with these characters who display various signs of arrested development and substance abuse they are profoundly unhappy people who have no concept of how to operate in an adult worldthe performances by all including ben gazzara and cynthia stevenson were first rate and the script by writerdirector todd solondz was brilliant camryn manheim telling the pedro story was funny but it shouldnt have beenthat is the irony of the movie you laugh at the dysfunctional behavior of others maybe it is because you realize they are just like you  bill excepted of courseat least billy read should turn out ok,black_comedy
like woody allen director todd solondz spends his time poking fun at mans petty desires foibles and beliefs whilst perhaps simultaneously wishing he werent such a dweeb and part of the very social fabric he condemns its the classic ego trap im better and above you but worthless and wish i were with you solondz made fear anxiety and depression in 1989 he wrote and directed that film and like woody allen also cast himself as the films neurotic hero like allens alter ego in annie hall the geeky looking solondz spent the entire film bumbling about venting his various dissaffectionssolondz was never happy with fear anxiety and depression hehehe however and promptly disowned the film when his producers reedited it behind his back burnt by the film industry solondz slipped into depression he cut himself off from the world and became a teacher and writer during these years his approach to art changed drastically his screenplays became more formal more precise more caustic and his visual style became cold ice coldsolondzs first film when he emerged from his depression was welcome to the dollhouse drawing upon his own unhappy school years dollhouse is about dawn weiner a girl whom the universe seems to have condemned more sinister than similar teen movies dollhouses dawn is so insecure shes happy to let a kid at school rape her if it means validating her own existence this would be rapist is himself marginalized insecure and so reliant on sexual threats for self validation similarly dawn is so filled with rage she saws off the heads of her sisters dolls fantasises about bashing people with a hammer and deliberately causes her sibling to be kidnapped by a local paedophile meanwhile all the swear words and abuses people hurl at the geeky dawn dawn hurls down at her little sister a girl whom she unfairly despises the result is that dawn is shown to be capable of the same kind of brutality that shes subjected to social bullying is internalised becomes selfhatred and is then redirected violently back out at othersdollhouse was a cosy film compared to solondzs next three flicks in he portrays a web of characters all of whom harbour different problems and neuroses but are nevertheless linked by their desire for absolute contentment and so we have a paedophile who is only happy around kids a successful writer who is only happy if she writes something of substance a musician who ironically writes songs of substance who cant find success and is so discontent an elderly couple who no longer have the will to live a fat man who fantasises about raping women a fat woman who is disgusted by sex and a seemingly satisfied housewife who is blissfully unaware of the disturbing truths that exist beneath her sweet suburban facade forget american beauty and blue velvet solondz ends his film with a norman rockwell kid ejaculating on his front balcony solondzs point lack breeds desire breeds suffering peel away the emotional baggage and is a stain that oft amounts to nothing more than a fleeting moment of biological blissdoesnt broadening its horizons to tackle the wider social and structural issues that better directors align to their existential musings but it does offer more than sam mendes american beauty indeed solondzs next film storytelling seemed designed to address those critics who pointed out the similarities between and american beauty mendes has himself slammed solondz on numerous occasions and so perhaps storytelling is best viewed as a sort of intellectual assault on solondzs criticsstorytelling is divided into two segments the first called fiction the second called nonfiction fiction is about a creative writing student who has sympathy sex with a retarded kid and later lets her black teacher rape her she then turns her experiences into a work of fiction which purports to be truthfully based on these factual encountersstorytellings second segment is about a documentary director who makes a documentary called american scooby a parody of american beauty in which he follows a high school student around campus the documentary director hopes to uncover the truth of growing up in suburbia but in reality is merely transposing his own deep thoughts selfanalysis and existential hangups onto a modern teen who is actually a dopey airhead the end result is that filmmaker and child enter a sort of exploitative relationship the kid gets fame and is portrayed as being deeper than he is while the filmmaker gets prestige for nothing end result solondz essentially advocates the sort of truthful sensationalism present in the nonfiction segment of the film whilst aligning human delusions love romantic illusions family etc with the fictions of the second half other themes abound  the power games and dominationexploitation reversals of dollhouse are reworked here with subplots about a vengeful maid and a black teacher  but its the american beauty angle thats most interestingpalindromes is thus far the weakest of solondzs films the first and last words in the movie are mom a pair of palindromes through which solondz implies that nothing ever changes indeed solondz makes the film a palindrome at every level his point being that we are paradoxically always changing and never changing hence different actors play the same character every desire and addiction merely supplanting another its an extremely bleak film depending how much trust the audience puts in its final monologue this bleakness has led to critics labelling solondz a misanthrope but hes no more colder than both allen and the coens two other contemporary critical darlings whove spent their careers reworking similar material7910  welcome to the dollhouse palindromes 810  storytelling,black_comedy
the first thing that alerts you to the idea that this might be a lighthearted journey is the title  dont be fooledi watched this movie on a recommendation and two days later i was still thinking about it  to me it dealt with often chilling aspects of sexual perversion with a great deal of sympathy for both the victims and the perpetrators  by the magic of great cinema neither of these groups were painted as angels or devils  one feels that the perpetrators are as yet victims tooif you are looking for something to open your eyes this is itone last thing i defy you not to cry during this movie  the last time i had tears in my eyes while watching a film was during life is beautiful,black_comedy
a movie with that title is clearly not going to be cheery no is a disturbingly harrow tale not unlike magnolia which features characters universally in a state of despairfollows the lives of a collection of people who all have a link with each other whether they know it or not it doesnt necessarily contain a plot as we know it rather it studies each character as they struggle to fight their own respective demonsphilip seymour hoffman as allen conveys a lonely sad man whose existence revolves around sex or his obsession about his lack of it hes in lust for one neighbour who barely acknowledges him and he satisfies himself by calling random numbers and talking to females while doing the businessdylan baker is bill on the surface a balanced happily married psychologist under it hes a disturbed sick paedophile  his character is incredibly well handled because we never feel totally appalled by him though we do feel appalled by his sickness rather we have a slight level of sympathy for him because he knows hes sick and is in a perennial state of despairjane adams is joy jordan whos never quite managed to get a hold of her life and seize the day shes living a frustrated existence and doesnt know what to with herself her 2 sisters cynthia married to bill and helen have their own issues too and patronise joy expecting more from her  helen in particular has become a huge success through her writing but underneath is a total fraud and she knows itthese are the main characters though there are many more and its ultimately a study of them like magnolia it is extremely well acted as we would expected from the class of player here and the direction is subtle and allows the story to flow granted you wont be thrilled at any point but it is pretty gripping stuff in context of how the characters developthe main problem with the movie is who it is aimed at because it is harrowing and distressing fare really paedophilia loneliness rape emptiness murder frustration and futile despair tend not to be attractive themes especially when theyre so graphically portrayed as they are here if you can tolerate such ideas then you might appreciate this movie which never pulls a punch its treading a fine line but just has enough dignity not to be sensationalistic rather just rawone last thing  i really dont see it as a comedy drama as it advertises itself its a dark drama with the occasional amusing momentps as the 11 year old billy bills son rufus read is outstanding,black_comedy
there is a moment midway through todd solondz third feature in which one of the characters chastises herself as nothing but a sordid exhibitionist  the same charge could and indeed probably still will be laid at the door of the films director given the fact that his movie includes graphic scenes of paedophilia rape and masturbation over its 2 hour runtime  remarkably though the picture steers well clear of gratuitous exhibitionism and is a resounding success bolstered by a string of fine performances and assured superbly paced direction  is built to shock but is simultaneously a beautifully observed and subtle piece that is as thoughtprovoking as it is grim and ghastlyit seems pointless to say that this is not a film for everyone but this should be reiterated and attempted comparisons to sam mendes american beauty are inevitable but futile  that work is an excellent piece in its own right but takes place in a world eons from that of lester burnham replace fluttering plastic bags with machine gun massacre daydreams and drugged child molesting and youre halfway there  solondz populates his film with an array of unsavoury characters who continuously find themselves in situations bordering on the unbearable for the viewer scenarios that are often more compulsive than repulsive  the camera is allowed to roam between storylines in an approach that is never disorientating retaining a sharp focus on the repugnant details that lurk behind the smiling suburban exteriorthe ensemble cast is pitched to perfection with the child actors deserving a special mention for some astounding acting in the face of supremely difficult material  amongst the more senior members dylan baker and the ubiquitous phillip seymour hoffman offer mature and controlled performances in two of the movies most fascinating developments  proper credit should also be given to the costume and makeup department as somehow these characters just look exactly right in their visual appearance  add to these carefully nuanced protagonists and inspired use of music and its clear that this is not a work of exploitative exhibitionismeven if this film had been a noble failure it would have been a notable moment in cinema history  the fact that it is a set in stone masterpiece means that its impact is redoubled  as the multilayered narrative weaves it way from one uncomfortable moment to the next one question keeps repeating in your mind how the hell did this ever get made  forget that though and just enjoy the fact that it did because moments of sunshine are often all too rare a fact emphasised throughout this film  might be a different beast altogether but its certainly an american beauty i challenge you not to be uplifted by as satisfying an ending as i can remember,black_comedy
it is rare that a director so succinctly and unflinchingly manages to commit his ideas to the screen with such conviction for that alone todd solondz deserves much praise it is a remarkable achievementwhat makes a distinctly unnerving viewing experience are those very ideas and perceptions of human existence for solondz man is trapped in an everlasting attempt to find an unattainable he is doomed to fail in this quest and will remain unfulfilled and worse condemned to eternal loneliness this holds for people of all ages and from all stratas of society besides the core of the central family there are other characters as varied as a poor russian immigrant taxi driverthief a very overweight well intentioned psychotic males who are perceived physically unappealing in the forms of phillip seymour hoffman and jon lovits and a hispanic doorman none of the above is exempt from the life sentence solendz contends we are all faced with not even sexy lara flynn boyle as a successful novelist there is no salvation unsurprisingly most of these characters at some point will attempt to achieve some respite in the form of sex most will fail the one character to succeed in fulfilling his sexual fantasy will pay the heaviest priceexistential gloom is not new to the cinema bergman became internationally renowned for this solondz expresses little compassion for his characters neither does he present them in a tragic light instead he opts for a deadpan humor coaxing us to laugh at these pathetic people not out of affection or understanding but rather simply as a response to life as he sees it on a first time viewing the sheer despondency of these characters seems to overwhelm the humor but watching the film again the humor seemed far more blatantthe performances are uniformly superb the entire cast seems to respond wonderfully to solondzs direction including the child performers this is testament to his prodigious talent which unfortunately was not used to the same effect in the following storytelling obviously this is not a movie for everyone since this bleak view on human life is clearly not shared by all but still this is a work which is undeniably a masterpiece of sorts,black_comedy
spoilerswhat isin my opinion pure is doing what social political economical or even moral values forbid us to doeating a cake on a diet getting drunk before a wedding throwing paper aeroplanes in class whatever the point is that we are all geared towards what we must do not what we want to dothis is where excels it shamelessly and effectively presents us with characters and situations that grind against these valuesthe story intertwines the lives of three sisters and some of the characters that they encounter joy jane adams hopelessly timid and repressed longs to be a singer but is prone to tearful breakdowns trish maplewood cynthia stevenson the wife that has everything but a realist world view and exciting sex life and helen lara flynnboyle a novelist with writers block that has no time for peoples real issues but wishes she could write about them authentically add to this trishs psychiatrist husband bill maplewood a superbly controlled dylan baker who has some less than healthy urges not to mention helens prank calling pervert allen philip seymour hoffman and you have a wide bizarre range of charactersbut the characters would be nothing without the world that todd solondz so masterfully creates in a similar way to magnolia and american beauty many of the characters chronicled seem to have perfect healthy lifes what makes so challenging is that these people are not dribbling word slurring fiends but actual people with real if not disturbing and problematic urgesbakers character can communicate effectively and with worrying honesty to his son while simultaneously having the uncontrollable desire to drug and play with his school friend flynnboyles attractive novelist clearly has so much to offer that she sees fit to ingnore the people that could become her very inspiration while seymour hoffmans nuisance caller has a ready made relationship in the form of a keen and relentlessly insecure neighbour christina camryn manheimuses hints at these darkest of dark character quirks to see just how far his audience will go we know that bill maplewood will commit an act of paedophilia we know that allen will eventually meet  and be rejected by the only person that finds the concept of him exciting and we know that joy will be used and discarded for sex the minute she trusts someone but we watch on just to see how grim their existences can get and the cause of all this incomprehensible disturbing behaviour the pursuit ofmaybe im making it all too simple but is the deepest darkest realms of where american beauty and magnolia go in order to ask the audience how their life really is,black_comedy
when i saw this movie first time i was excited about the different characters and the directors hillarious attempt showing how much people are made to pretend you can start imagining the same about your neighbours by the second time i watched this movie i thought that all these well acting characters dont necessarily make a good story it is an entertaining peep behind the curtain of peoples private life and problems which are not openly discussed in society,black_comedy
if you are easily offended or you plan on watching this with the granny at christmas i recommend you dont the subject matter in this film is as difficult as you can imaginebut if you are a real film buiff that loves acting of the finest order that i suggest that you get to watch this as soon as possible is unlike any movie i have ever seen the dialogue is fantastic and keeps you gripped throughout but you cant help feeling that you are snooping on the private lives of group of people that are as mixed up as you can possibly get philip semour hoffman is fantastic and this role reminds me very much of the performance in magnolia and the film isnt too disimular either some of the conversations between the father and son sometimes feel a bit hard to believe but somehow that makes the film quirky and highly watchable a film not to be missed 9 out of 10,black_comedy
no one else has ever made a movie this strange and that is because i dont think anyone else could get away with it  todd solondz is a genius and i look forward to his future films even though storytelling wasnt the greatest  this film is unique and tackles subjects that other films would not dare touch  this could be a good movie simply because its different but its also funny touching and emotional disturbing  that is a good thing however because it makes us think and other movies dont do that at least not with being entertaining as well,black_comedy
may contain some spoilersfirst ill start off this review by saying sex is a powerful thing  it seems to have the power to control everything  people these days are always looking for more ways to have better sex lives some are even making money from it  of course everyone wants to get laid and weve seen many many films about people who get sex all the time  however there havent been many serious films not counting some lame teen comedies about those who just cant get sex either because theyre considered too unattractive their desire is out of reach or what they want is just too taboo or even illegal  probably the first film ive seen to accurately portray what ive mentioned is  ive never seen sexually unsatisfied people portrayed so accurately in a film until i saw  todd solondz is a brave filmmaker and goes where nowhere else has gone in a film before none of the characters in this film seem to be satisfied with their sex lives and their problems differ one is a selfproclaimed boring and unattractive person who desires his beautiful neighbor but of course cant have her another is a seemingly typical middleclass father who hides a secret and illegal lust for his sons underage friends then we have a woman who is just too emotionally insecure to find the kind of man she wants  these are just a few of the characters represented in and its guaranteed that you will find yourself actually caring about them by the time the film is over  of course the most controversial aspect of the film is its portrayl of a pedophile most people were angered because they felt as if solondz was trying to make people sympathize with a pedophile but thats not quite it  you see the pedophile in this film knows he has a problem he knows his feelings are wrong but theres no way he can get help with these problems  he tries to satisfy his forbidden desires by masturbating to teenybopper magazines but eventually the desire for the real thing overcomes him  what solondz is trying to say here is two things one a pedophile can be just about anyone even your friendly neighborhood shrink and two pedophilia is something that can be prevented these kind of people often know they have a problem but there is no where they can go to get help for it  its a huge wakeup call  other than that i didnt really find the film shocking i found it more thoughtprovoking many of the scenes here weighed heavy on my mind afterwards and i was constantly contemplating them in my head for days  not only must i give huge praise to director todd solondz for having the guts to come up with a film like this i also must praise the cast  they took on some of the most difficult roles in film history and each one of them nailed their parts each line of dialogue in the biting script was delivered wonderfully and believably  im really surprised that there was no oscar nominations for this film although given the difficult subject matter its not surprising the often closeminded academy shunned it its amazing to think that one year later american beauty won a ton of awards from the academy when it was obviously a watereddown version of  this is one of those rare films that has the ability to move you and disturb you but its definately not for everyone  it should definately only be seen by mature audiences im only 17 but i was able to handle it fine although i wouldnt recommend it to many people my age mainly due to the fact that theyve been weaned on stuff like lord of the rings and xxx and therefore wouldnt really understand it  other than that is perhaps the best movie ive ever seen  the direction acting and script are perfect  i cant recommend it highly enough for openminded people1010 one of my alltime favorites,black_comedy
deeply disturbing provacative and complex solondz is a unique voice who refreshes us with his inability to compromise this is a groundbreaking film a film that tests the limits of the audience and achieves because it gives us credit where so many other films dont a must see the best film in recent years makes american beauty look like american pie,black_comedy
was extremely disturbing depressing and dark it was also bitingly funny how i loved it every character was very dysfunctional but in a way that was so real that it brought me back to my own traumatic past experiences it took me places in my head that i dont often go and sometimes avoid going and for that i thank it muchlyit shows family  lovers that dont even know each other they dont share their deep secrets and for the most part dont even try they claim to love the shells around them while holding fast to their own theyre completely alienated  disconnected most of the time they arent even conscious of it because its so routine for how they livethere were so many interesting themes characters who desired something deeply then regretted it once it was theirs pathetic selfdefeating behaviors sex and the pursuit of it trying to be real vs living behind a facadei also loved the music canned cheerful joyful sounds just made what was going on behind them all the more twistedi cant say enough about it oh so good but definitely not for the fainthearted,black_comedy
has the production value of a tv movie yet its also one of the most sinisterly dark films i have ever seen  at times seems like it is trying a little too hard to be shocking  the whole exploration of an orgasm with a 12 year old boy seemed phony to me  however the film also contains surprisingly intriguing aspects such as its voyeur view of a pedophile and a loser who makes dirty phone calls  the cast is strong but philip seymour hoffman damn near steals the show,black_comedy
there has been a buzz around broadbottom the last few months as those who had seen but who clearly didnt understand film distribution in britain goaded those who hadnt  thinking back these were tales that was a must see rather than great film  specific details were sparse  however the national press came down all in favour leaving me all the more peeved to miss its shortlived appearance in manchester  finally finally i recently got to see it on a brief reprisewell im afraid its not big and its not clever  none of the characters deserves my sympathy  not one could i perhaps embarrassingly relate to i found it mildly entertaining but masturbation and buggery dont always make good viewing and conversationronps  please please tell me that the title is not the ken dodd joke c 1967,black_comedy
she saidthis movie was extremely disturbing  the acting may have been excellent and the characters somewhat interesting but the characters lacked any conscience and morals which overshadowed the whole movie and left you w a feeling of numbnesshe saidthis movie was very depressing and had few redeeming qualities in it  the characters were very warped and twisted which in and of itself does not make a bad movie but there was little if any good in any of themperhaps the only thing i could take out of this movie was that it makes you feel pretty damn good about your own life,black_comedy
is like a really bad accident on the side of the road  you know its wrong but you cant look away  i cant say i was bored exactly at any point during this movie but it was terrible just the samethroughout the film we are exposed to any number of vile images and irredeemable characters  the filth is almost palpable  i would compare this film to natural born killers except instead of promoting violence it promotes child rapei mean it does have a happy ending of sorts but it was glossed over had the resolution of the plotlines been nearly as explicit as either of the 2 ejaculation scenes i might not have been so hard on this film  but when you have dialogue that requires an 11yearold actor to say words that i cant repeat here theres something wrong  and it goes way beyond just making a bad moviein conclusion you should only watch this movie if you think john waters movies are too tame,black_comedy
first of all how about that title ironic no witty huh a movie called that in fact contains little or no this is mindboggling in its complexity and ingenuity right and one of the characters names is joy brilliant not really just like the happy whimsical music that plays throughout the films soundtrack were supposed to either be shocked and sickened by the contrast between the music and the onscreen action be introduced to new and vertiginous depths of filmmaking ironyie isnt the music supposed to reflect the action whats going on this isnt a happy scene why the happy music either this or where we just kind of laugh along because were in on the joke we know whats going on were supposed to laugh this is a comedy but well which is iteven solondz we get the impression doesnt really know he makes a grand show of pulling no punches after all doesnt this movie have everything even remotely icky from divorce to suicide from unhealthy obsession to rapefantasies from masturbation to homosexual intolerance from loneliness to rape to obesity to murder and mutilation and bodypartsinfreezer from pedophiles to serial rapists to gunmassacre daydreamers to spacedout psychologists hey why not all in one character certainly appears to run the gamut maybe thats part of the problem solondz has tried putting everything in this movie every classically cliched ostensibly gutwrenching human ugliness to ever touch paper or filmstock but to what end to what effect were not even given a chance to suffer from any desensitizationguilt because weve been cold cocked by depravity overloadthe humorous aspects of this film play out like a poorly scripted snl skit take the fatherson discussions which are basically leave it to beaver parodies as if penned by a college newspaper editor shoulderpatting sympathetic nods sound fatherly adviceand the kids asking how to come all this is missing is a laugh track the overthetop factor is poorly acted or poorly directed or just poor im not laughing at you im laughing with you these attempts unfortunately fall short of constituting as a black comedyyou cant in all seriousness really be shocked or mortified or disgusted by these textbook cases of unpleasantness the closest we ever come and only in brief flashes is with the almostsympathetic pedophile character you want to like this guy because you want to feel sympathy for a pedophile rapist because that indeed would be shocking and we want nothing more than to be shocked to oblige solondz to recognize and appreciate all his efforts unfortunately its just not possible we could have been treated to a darkly disturbing if perhaps formulaic and manipulative film or a goofy overthetop laughoutloud maybe im being generous black comedy of a flick but were left with neither but do me a favor huh dont call it its a wonderful life or something,black_comedy
beautifuly well played with a bunch of awesome actors this movie takes place in an upper class family the director dissect its dysfunctionnals members with a perverse and naive pleasure drugs sex rape murder failure and exploitation lead the characters into a nowhere land very similar to our everydays landscape does exists  seems not one of the scariest yet funniest movie depicting the traditionnal model of american family,black_comedy
plumbs the outwardly normal lives of a handful of loosely interconnected characters and discovers everything from neuroses to depravity to criminal insanity this bleak and very dark comedys austerity serves to make the characters stand out as it methodically reveals its disturbing stories not for everyone is a groundbreaker which many will wish had left the soil unturned,black_comedy
has been showing on sundance channel here in new zealand  i loved it  its black dysfunctional and probes some of the less explored areas of essentially the meaninglessness of real lifeseemed to me like a woody allen film made by a gentileor a less slick american beauty  its to be repeated in a few daysand im keen to see it again,black_comedy
i think that all the characters in this film were in search of conversely meant different things to different people the movie is obviously very disrturbing the fact is that these disturbing things do happen in a matter of fact way in real life to real people this is meant to point the finger at these problems  the fact that they exist what as a society are we going to do if anything about itart often serves as a mirror of the society that surrounds it in this case the mirror was flawless too bad most of us dont have the guts to take that close a look at it,black_comedy
to tell the truth i was expecting to loathe this film  i thought that maybe just maybe i would loathe it yet grudgingly admit that it was good the strange thing is that i enjoyed it  not so much while it was playing its sheer agony to watch  enjoyment comes if at all afterwardsso  why is it agony to watch  certainly not because were presented with repulsive images  were not  if we had been the film could not possibly have been worth watching just as a novel consisting of ugly prose could not possibly be worth reading  the agony comes entirely from the characters we dread what they will do or say next we dread what will happen to them next we dread what they will reveal about themselves next  we dread until we have sunk deep into our seats and our hands are covering our eyes  i have no idea how solondz managed to make us care about these people so much its harder than he makes it lookthe most sympathetic character by far is the paedophile  hes intelligent for most of the time he means well despite the dark things going on his mind perhaps the most sympathetic thing about him is that hes intelligent enough to know that there are dark things going on in his mind hes a good father and we know he would never whatever his desires molest his own son  the last thing i wanted was for him to be caught and humiliated  im ignoring the killingspree fantasy he reveals at one point but this was a gratuitous addon unworthy of the rest of the film its best ignoredthe coincidences that either plague or enliven other ensemble pictures are present in this one as well  the psychiatrists patient just happens to be his wifes sisters neighbour actually thats the only such coincidence i can think of in fact now that i come to think of it it isnt even a problem since although this coincidence is meaningless it does no work the film would still be as coherent a whole without it  which is not to say that its a perfectly coherent whole in the way that  well a really firstrate is  oh well  solondz presumably knew when he set to work on that a film consisting of grey vignettes could not be more than a minor artistic success  at least it is a minor artistic successps  i love the camerawork  everything every single room streetscape and prop that we see is dull cold and antiseptic  even on the rare occasions when a room is messy it manages to be messy in a completely lifeless way  everything is so blandly ugly  yet the photography is never itself ugly  ditto the script it depicts little but ugliness without itself being ugly,black_comedy
this movie wants to make a strong point about the disturbing reality of american life that hides beneath an ordinary facade  it does so by bludgeoning the viewer with repulsive image after repulsive image  in fact the movie focuses so much on disgusting images that if we look underneath we find theres nothing left this movie is all shock value  and its trying to make a point that more skilled filmmakers have made many times before  try american beauty for a better take on the same theme,black_comedy
the us is producing a society that corporate pr tries to persuade us is a society to be admired  solondzs film gives us a brilliantly perceptive portrait of that society  does for neoliberal rule something akin to what the marquis de sades writings did for libertinage  makes us laugh about it makes us shrink in horror from it and above all makes us desperately want to articulate what is wrong with it why it is not what we desireif you ever wanted to cut out the cp from your life see this film it will help you do it,black_comedy
ill give the director credit for having the guts to make a story about a psychiatrist raping young boys i suppose we all have our dark sides and this movie just exaggerates things the only problem is that the movie let the director down its just not that goodwith the exception of joy none of the characters are realized beyond the familiar sentimental stereotypes weve seen again and again allen the masturbating neighbor is played like the sweaty stammering lonely pig that we all think he is and ill give him credit for borrowing the george sanders thing in talented mr ripley but hoffman just isnt that good he plays himself out of this movie by playing to our expectations its kind of sad reallythe faux irony of the music score is really annoying too like new york artsy fartsy people trying to impress each other all the time what a waste of a movie,black_comedy
do not see this movie  trust me  just dont do it  its not that its a bad movie or a terrible movie but it is just really disturbing and more than likely it will haunt you for a long timethis movie is about anything but,black_comedy
our english teacher made us watch this really horrible movie  if there wasnt any humor in it it could have been a lot worse  the characters all seemed a little 2d and there really wasnt much of a plot unless you are thinking that all the sex was really the plot  there had to have been a better way to get the point that the director wanted to make that did not include subjecting minors to raunchy sexwhen people think that this movie is anything like american beauty they have got to be kidding  there is nothing farther than the truth american beauty at least had a plot  they also did not subject us to the constant whining that the characters in did  the smartest thing in the whole movie was the end  the woman got it right  she left  thats what i should have done when i saw the first 5 minutesi know that there had to have been a point to this whole movie but it is really not coming to me  maybe someone else could explain why people spent time and money to make a movie that could almost be called a pornoi really see no redeeming qualities in this movie  it would be interesting to see really what the director wanted us to see but i dont think that it will happen any time soon  personally i think that it is educational i just dont see how it fits in with our english class,black_comedy
this is an evil movie if evil can be used as a complimentsolondz excels at making us squirm at dragging out the uncomfortable moment to the point where you may find yourself watching this movie peeking through your fingers or with clenched fistthere have been some comparisons made with the more recent american beauty and indeed both movies share a particularly twisted view of suburban existence while less tightly focused than beauty and overall probably slightly less successful chooses to be even more audaciousno more so than in its treatment of the relationship between the father and his son which is at once hysterical in both senses of the word subversive affirming tragic moving and confronting the earnestness of the fatherson conversations harks back to the family fare of 50s and 60s television though the subject matter certainly doesntalso noteworthy is the music which manages to slyly comment on events with its insidious banal sentimentalitycertainly not a movie for everyone,black_comedy
ok take a good cast of actors a writing talent which cannot be argued with an idea to focus in on the harsh realities of everyday love lifesthis movie is sounding promisingbut then add a sub plot involving a puberty near child and his pedophilic father and what do you get one of the worst films ive ever seen honestly this film made me realise even more that the last thing us brits need is an occasional ration of american culture macdonalds i can handle perverted crap i cannot check out this years love if you want a classy 90s love story,black_comedy
this movie is to me more comedy than drama a great comedy the funny sides overshadow the dark sides even though they are rather dark in solondz manages to tell a story of many protagonists and does it better than i have seen before the characters are very real and attractive especially joy and helen and none of them is left undeveloped being a woody allen fan i very much  liked to see his former wife louise lasser since i have not seen much of her these last years and talking about allen is not so far from him dealing with people with sexual frustrations perversions and miseries in a somewhat funny way this film is among the best films i have seen  is far better than secrets and lies for example and ranks as high as allens best,black_comedy
spoilers aheadthis movie shows a child being praised for masturbating this movie features a pedophile who never gets punished for his despicable actions in fact he is actually better off by the end of the movie the disgusting sexual deviancy involving minors made me want to be sick the only reason i watched to the end of this movie was to make sure the pedophile got what was coming to him and i was very sorely disappointed when he did not this movie should be avoided at all costs i would give this move a 0 rating if i could the movie is called but i felt worse after this movie than any other movie i can remember i literally felt physically sick,black_comedy
runthats right put as much distance as you can between yourself and this filmi truly regret having watched this movieyes the world can be a dark place yes there are weird people who do weird things but no we do not need a movie that shows us what shows uschild rape incest domination fetishes and the like are not something that even art should try to tackle the least this movie could have done is show child rape as wrongi dont know perhaps im to conservative to see that even men who drug their childs friends and rape them can still be nice normal people we should empathize withi may not be religious but my watching this movie was a sindo not show this movie around children the elderly or those with a sense of moral conscience all of the above will be deeply offended and not in that oh how dark yet fascinating sort of wayfor the love of all that is pure and good in this world do not see this moviei rate this film 110 it would be 000001513100000000 but thats not possible,black_comedy
im not even sure how to begin to explain the way im feeling about this movie after watching it for the first time on cable television right notim usually the first to recommend and support films that are of a different nature films that bring to light topics which usually are not touched upon and makes you think about situations that persons normally do not experience in their lives  i have most recently seen requiem for a dream and think that this is one of the most exciting films of the decade  darren ofnosky is a truly talented director that should have received more attention than he actually got but this film is just disgustingplain and simple  what was the point to bringing the topic of pedophilia to the screen  granted it is important to me to understand various types of people in todays society but what makes this director think that we should have any kind of sympathy for a pedophile  i dont care if its uncontrollable or a disease or some sort of warped mental conditionits just plain sick  and how could the parents of the 12 year old boy let their son play a role of this nature have we lost all sense of our ethics and morals in this society  do we have no boundaries  how is the directors deep portrayal of this movie any different from men that actually commit these crimes  and how can any person actually get anything out of watching a little boy masturbate  yes its sad to realize the affects that pediophilia may have on immediate family i think that it is common sense that the affects are devastating but why portray it in this manner  to this degree  it may be a real portrayal of real life but shouldnt some things just be left untouched  this is entertainment  watching this is supposed to open my eyes and bring a sense of reality into my life  no it just makes me wonder how warped the director actually is to get this explicit with this topic i think that it would have been different if the director had actually tried to go somewhere with it if his message was to somehow make us aware of this condition to see it in a different light and give his audience something to think about  but all it did for me was bring out disgust and anger  i hope no director ever touches this topic again in the way that this director did i urge everyone to never watch this movie and to never watch any of this directors movies again,black_comedy
there is something to be said for writers and directors who chose to take risks and be original to create a new and breakthrough film which challenges convention and delights and impresses audiences at the same time filmmakers such as alfred hitchcock stanley kramer george lucas and steven spielberg are all examples of this  todd solondz however is not and as much as the critics today would like to try and make him be he comes far short despite all the critical acclaim this movie is getting it is in reality a big waste of time  a film that pushes the envelope strictly to push the envelope but overall not really saying anything and leaving the audience i can speak for myself my friends and many people at the theatre i was at who were noticeably taken aback alienated and disgusted the story  there isnt really a plot  centres around the lives of three sisters and follow them and the men around them through many strange and perverse sexual episodes  whether its the paedophile the paedophiles son who is obsessed with making himself ejaculate the whambamthankumam guy or the guy who harasses women on the phone while masturbating this movie has it all including the money shot in the masturbating scene well does all this say anything  about the realities of life  or the illusions about these topics  not really  it says about what we would expect it to say  that paedophiles are bad people and sex fiends are deprived people  but the subject matter was treated very coldly through most of the film with only occasional moments where i could see past these exteriors to the actual people and try to feel for them  but overall i just felt pushed away and i found myself anxious to leave after the first 90 of the 134 mins  oh yeah and it was way too damn long now i do have to say a good word about the acting  some of the performances where very good  i was particularly interested in the relationship between philip seymour hoffman twister boogie nights and camryn manheim bonfire of the vanities tvs the practice which by the end became a desperate need for companionship despite the events surrounding their lives in that tiny new jersey apartment  and dylan baker was haunting as paedophile father bill maplewood who ends up preying on his sons friends  he was sickening and disturbing to watch now i know you may be thinking if the movie is this affecting doesnt mean it is doing something  no about the only thing it does is sicken and disgust you  it just seems like a personal project that he put together to see how far he could take things  i see nothing genius or extraordinary about this movie  it plays to the lowest common denominator  if this movie actually ends up speaking to you on some higher level you may want to see a psychiatrist,black_comedy
normally im not a big fan of bashing movies  i pride myself on being as objective as one can get who doesnt  unfortunately this is one of those rare films that i simply could not stomachis a lengthy pointless examination of pathetic people whose pathetic lives intertwine with other pathetic people living pathetic lives whew  there is no hope no message no nothing  just minute after minute of these poor wretched folks mucking through their dreary existencesit would have been one thing if any of these characters would have grown or changed or come to some kind of realization about their lives  but they dont  its a sad depressing tale for the sake of being sad and depressingi dont understand what mr solondz was attempting to accomplish with this movie  i had everything i needed to know about the story and the characters within the first half hour  the rest of the movie was a gratuitous rehashing of the same boring and abysmal livesfrom a purely technical standpoint the movie is fine  the acting and directing is above average if not adequate  unfortunately i simply could not relate the characters or story at all  if youre a happy good natured person you will most likely find nothing appealing about this film  this is one of the ultimate poor me films ever created  if you enjoy these kinds of movies my heart goes out to you could very well become your holy graili gave it a 310,black_comedy
lovely little film thank you so much todd i wish id had the chance to speak with you last night after the film instead of before i would have loved to have told you exactly what i thought of it  and youi first watched  or tried to  several years ago on dvd ordinarily i never see a theatrical film on the small screen for the first time but i was so impressed with welcome to the dollhouse i decided to break my own rule dollhouse may be the funniest yet cruelest film ever made about the hell of junior high i originally avoided at the theater because it sounded depressing and ridiculously bleak who needs that kind of misery but a few years later i decided to give it a try though  thinking hey what does the la times know anyway rightas it turned out  plenty my initial instincts and fears were proved right black comedy maybe if youre a sadomasochist not only was it overlong exploitative and gratuitous  it was so selfindulgent we learn infinitely more about the filmmaker than the characters alternately bored and revolted i gave up about halfway throughi decided to give the film one final try last night when it was shown properly on the big screenthe proper format didnt helpbecause of the upcoming release of solondzs new film palindromes the american cinematheque at the aero screened both dollhouse and with solondz answering questions between filmsdollhouse was almost as good as i remembered funny and real and ferociously unsentimental somehow the balance works just right heather matarazzo and the other teen actors are so strong and believable they counteract the overacting adults such as the mother  so over thetop and deadset against dawn she nearly ruins the picture afterwards solondz answered questions about his films and career i almost felt a little sorry for him when the largely high schoolage audience began snickering  apparently chuckling at his truman capotelike voice and stammering almost painful delivery like his films when solondz speaks you dont know whether he wants you to laugh  or cryin retrospect the debacle of points up defects in dollhouse a lot can be traced to dawns insanely overthetop monstrous mother mirrored by the equally overacting wife of the pedophile in these characters plus the nerdy brother and constantlyworshiped little sister evidently put solondzs life experiences in view  and they are painful indeedbut in he simply goes too far like a child given free reign over the blackboard after school he scrawls as many dirty words as possible no matter how offensive or pointless worst of all his screenplay takes a number of shocking incidents and offensive characters and stirs them into a reprehensible mishmosh and like the child endlessly pushing his limits solondz finally destroys what he has created by going too far  with ridiculously overthetop farrelly brothersstyle grossout humor these scenes completely negate whatever drama his cast has created both the pedophile played by dylan baker and rufus read portraying his son certainly dig deeper into their souls than probably anyone ever thought possible both are extremely powerful but i wonder how embarrassed they are when someone recognizes them on the street is this the way an actor should go through lifeapparently because of traumas he suffered growing up solondz has come to despise humanity he has chosen to distance himself from if not despise his characters even the ones we want to like he dumps cruelty upon misfortune upon humiliation onto them retribution it seems likelybut ultimately this sort of cruelty makes him look like the bully not the victim the only real sympathy he creates is for his poor actorsone of the best things about dollhouse was its ending showing dawn triumphing in spite of adverse circumstances we grow to love her and are happy to see her perseverebut we love none of the people in  not any more than laboratory rats sequestered in a cage and forcefed poison beginning with the first scene the movie feels like either a contrived shockforthesakeofshock soap opera  where no one behaves realistically  or some kind of insane sociological experiment where each miserable subject is alternately tortured and taunted for no apparent benefit and as opposed to an altman film which this somewhat resembles we are almost always aware we are watching actors on a set saying things merely because the director and script dares them tothe chipper wife for example photographed with a wide angle lens for maximum distortion seems to have stepped out of a detergent commercial an experienced director would have brought out something real something human grounding her somehow to planet earth but solondz seems to favor exaggerated caricaturish grotesqueness over reality like neil labute he may have been better off working in theaterin my view solondz is the one who needs the shrink not phillip seymour hoffman gay or straight pedophile or no solondz obviously has serious issues  and i suppose filmmaking serves as therapy this film alone could have fueled about twenty years of indepth analysisim not laughing at you im laughing with you lara flynn boyle says at one point this is the crux of the whole problem solondz never laughs with his characters  always at them ben gazzara says to his wife i feel nothing another telling moment but sometimes solondz does feel something for his characters hatredand worse like the people at the aero last night he snickers and mocks them probably with the same cruelty once harbored by those who taunted him all those years ago,black_comedy
 sang both the beatles and the breeders and after seeing this black comedy  i thought sticking a gun in my mouth would be more preferable than sitting through this movie  whats it about  well some of it follows a man  i use that word in its loosest sense of course  who likes to have monosex while talking on the phone to women who he randomly calls and some it follows a man who has a sexual fixation on children  gawd and i thought jeepers creepers was disturbing  i should also point out that i never watched the end of the movie as i switched off half way through wich may invalidate this review  but bare in mind that many people from a mainstream audience will be also be very uncomfortable with the subject matter film tutor legend dov s simens is on record as saying never ever pitch a film script as a black comedy because its such a vague expression and after seeing a myriad of indie black comedy movies i fully agree with him  got a weird unentertaining script  just call it a black comedy and no one will notice  and no one will produce it either hopefully,black_comedy
basically a robert altman interactionofmultiplelives movie only if altman was a lonely sexual deviant who got off on making people uncomfortable if you enjoy the discomfort and failure of others youll like this film if not then not,black_comedy
this movie isnt terrible but its not very entertaining there isnt any centeral protagonist or end goal in this movie its just a collection of scenes that are tied loosely together by various relationships thatd be fine if it was interesting but it isnt it doesnt take very long for the uncomfortable and mostly meaningless interactions to get very boring it doesnt help that the cinematography is extremely flat and uninteresting for a movie thats everyone is calling depressing it actually isnt for the most part im definitely not saying that it is lighthearted but its just more weird and uncomfortable than deptessing for the most part if the characters had a bit more depth then they might be considered depressing but i dont know i admittedly didnt finish this movie but i got pretty far mostly i was waiting for it to get good before i realized that this movie has nothing interesting to offer,black_comedy
how come that this movie was completely overlooked by most big award ceremonies probably because of its controversial subjects its brilliantly written and directed and brilliantly acted out by its cast members its perhaps the most overlooked movies from the 90s and is on a level of brilliance i havent seen a movie on for a long time this is one of those movies that grabs and doesnt let go it makes you forget the time and everything else that is happening around you i havent watched a movie in that way since like forever it made a truly unique viewing experience that left a big impression the movie kept me thinking for hours afterward and i could hardly sleep because of ithere they are characters we often hear and read about in the papers and on tv characters we simply think of as being unsympathetic monsters we dont want to spend too much thoughts about im talking about pedophiles and phone sex masturbaters among others this movie shows that in truth often those people are nothing more than common persons with a good job money and a family of their own they could be a colleague of yours a neighbor or even a family member a person you think you know but without ever truly knowing what is going on in their heads and what their perverted sexual fantasies and preferences are the movie shows that these sort of things could happen in your neighborhood or somebody you know its shocking and confronting but of course closer to the truth then them just being coldhearted ruthless monsters even though the thought of it is strangely more comforting the fact that it all are ordinary persons is far more shocking none of the characters wants to be that way they just are that waydoes a good job at creating a realistic environment and story lines and connecting all those different lines together in the movie the movie follows multiple different characters and therefor also story lines but the movie never gets disjointed even though of course every storyline has its weaker and less interesting moments it also doesnt make the movie confusing or unnecessary hard to follow like some other directors would probably have done with the story alejandro gonzlez irritu or steven soderbergh springs to mind the movie instead chooses a light comedy like approach comedies really dont get darker than this despite its heavy subjects the movie is also still fun to watch with some great funny moments it in a way makes the movie also more accessible to a wider range of audiencethe movie is of course also truly uplifted by its fine cast even actors who i normally dont really like like lara flynn boyle were just great while watching this movie it made me realize something philip seymour hoffman is probably my favorite actor at the moment what can i say hes just great im glad he finally won an oscar last year finally true recognition for one of the best actors in the business not just now but of all time but it in all honesty is dylan baker who gives the best performance he without doubt plays the toughest role of the movie a married with children psychiatrist pedophile he manages to make the character in a way more accessible and understandable especially the sequences with his teenage son who is starting to discover his own sexuality are greatly done and very powerful especially toward the end of the movie also jane adams delivers a notable performance as a too kind person who gets exploited by others because of it the pain and innerconflicts of the characters as portrayed in this movie are almost sensibleif you want to or not this movie makes you look differently at the world and the sexual perverts we hear and read about it therefor makes a powerful and effective thought provoking portrayal of real life humane characters1010httpbobafett1138blogspotcom,black_comedy
although i must admit steve blackfoot can be quite presumptuous at times  contumelious even i must say that is one of the best works of cinema in the last 10 years it certainly has found a worthy home on steves top 5 favorite films of all time listi highly recommend this to any solondz fan or anyone who appreciates a clever black comedy however i must portend for those umbrageous cinema lovers the humor in this film can be quite aberrant beware neonatesi would rate as being equal in quality to welcome to the dollhouse after that i would place palindromes and then storytelling i have not been able to find fear anxiety and depression but i only hear of its mediocrity regardless i would like to find it i have seen his nyu short schatts last shot and for what it is its a brilliant short film,black_comedy
yes this movie was gross yes this movie was kind of scary and yes this movie made me feel sick and disgusted and thats why i enjoyed it not because of the content but the balls of everyone who made it believe it or not it depicted real people and real situations no one gets mad when a movie is made about hitler or some infamous murderer why are those horrific situations any different than the ones in this movie movies are made for the audience to understand something from a different perspective and to understand people and why they do the things they do i appreciate the bold honesty of this film who wants to see pretty perfect people doing normal things that to me isnt real life movies are supposed to induce emotions sorrow disgust whatever movies should move the audience weather it be in a good way or a bad way philip seymour hoffman is one of the best male actors ever and he makes any movie art no he didnt portray someone we should respect and look up to but he gets respect because he was honest with himself in doing this role and he accomplished the goal of any actorpretend your someone so the audience will truly understand who they were i must admit this film was kind of boring but compelling at the same time so i give it a 6,black_comedy
i watched this film as an xmas treat in my university ethics class and having done so all the time in a combination of wonder and intrigue  i can tell you that this is one of the important films one that not only changes but enlightens and progresses your life after experiencing it now ill tell you whyis a very black comedy that finds humour in the most desperate of human struggles i wont go into the detail of what these struggles are but i will say that they are some considered pretty despicable by most as well as these their are other more subtle psychological problems which are shown to great effect in the name of a plot that will move the viewer but in a very different way from usualthe beauty of is its lack of disgust its the kind of thing that shallow minds write letters to the government to ban in the lack of a prejudiced and conservative eye gives a very real sense of the people that would otherwise be portrayed as despicable baddies another reviewer wrote here that he never thought he could sympathise with a paedophile until he saw and i feel this sums the films greatest quality up well with its interesting wit and deeply probing insights causes the viewer to feel the pains and pleasures and even more particular states of its quietly desperate charactersits impressive how such a film can remain funny but does even in areas where one may not believe humour has a place not to give too much away the facts of life type conversations between a father and son i find particularly amusing  although its worth pointing out that theyre not conducted in the over used awkward and stuttered way that most movie makers favourif you want to see a truly different and deeply engaging film that will leave you with a deeper understanding of humanity  is for you,black_comedy
is an incredibly disturbing film that made me feel queasy at times the subject matter is extremely perverse and is handled in the form of dark comedyreally dark comedyprobably the darkest ive ever seen actually i still cant help but squirm in my seat during certain scenes just because the subject matter bothers me so much but thats actually a good sign because it means the film is effective at what its trying to accomplish it succeeds at exactly what it is trying to do although some of the subplots drag on a little too long and feel excessive at time nonetheless if you like this sort of thing go for it just be prepared for a pretty bizarre motion picture,black_comedy
i just watched this film on tv last night man i thought i couldnt be shocked by film anymore the last 15 minutes is without doubt the most uncomfortable i have ever witnessed in film some people that i have spoken to who watched the film stated that they found themselves feeling a certain amount of sympathy for the paedophile psychiatrist played by dylan baker i certainly felt sympathy for a fair few of the characters not least philip seymour hoffmans hopeless crank caller but i cant say i felt that much sympathy for bakers character i never got the feeling that he was particularly sorry about the things that he had done and was certainly the creepiest character in the film which says something on the other hand my sympathies lay with the young billy as you watch his world fall apart as he finds out his father is not who he believes to be and with joy the only genuinely likable sister who seems to suffer one mishap after another in her pursuit ofthis would have been unbearable if it were not for a blackly comic sense of mischief that is apparent through the whole film the music is almost ridiculously out of place throughout the most part of the film which only adds to the black comedy throughout thankfully though this is not used in some of the more controversial scenes the performances are universally great especially philip seymour hoffman who manages to bring to his character a certain amount of pathos that a character as vile as his does not deserve ben gazarra also does a great job as the sisters father while dylan baker puts in the most memorable turn as the family man who suffers from the most terrible urgesultimately solondz has made an unflinchingly brilliant look at the underbelly of america this film will succeed in offending a lot of people but he wont be bothered about that at the same time while the film is excellent i dont think its one that i could watch againshame that solondz has not been able to scale the heights of this since though,black_comedy
deals with the lives of three sisters in suburban nj each sister is as different as night and day all try to pretend to be happy when they actually arent and who could forget the disturbed neighbors and family members which are part of their lives joy played by jane adams has bad luck with relationships when she tries to politely exit a relationship with her dorky boyfriend andy john lovits he commits suicide she feels guilty and leaves her job as a telemarketer to teach immigrants english things get worse for joy as literally everyone dumps on her the entire movie poor joy i know the feeling then their is helen lara flynn boyle the successful sister shes an unhappy author who has regular one night stands she fantasizes about being raped by an obscene prank phone callerphillip seymore hoffman hoffman gives an outstanding performance as a lonely man with kinky fantasies this leads him to dial random numbers talking dirty in order to get off the last sister trish cynthia stevenson is an annoying conservative housewife who thinks she has it all she has two kids a beautiful home and a psychiatrist husband little does she know of her husbands problem with pedophilia the subject matter is dark but at the same time very funny todd solondz is a director who creates an atmosphere of uneasy laughter youll tell yourself not to laugh but you just cant help it is psychosexual like blue velvet and has lonely alienated characters like in magnolia todd solondz makes viewers cringe and laugh with his harsh realism clearly the mpaa doesnt like realism in cinema the film received an nc17 rating for its tone but the mpaa seems to love handing out rratings for stylized gore and cgi violence and sophomoric bodily humor but realistic subject matter gets an nc17 why there is much worse things on cable television or the news for that matter,black_comedy
im sure there are some people who still refuse to watch when it was originally released todd solondzs controversial ensemble film caused quite a stir for some of its subject matter the critics were sharply divided between those who found it a brilliant piece of work and those who thought it was the product of a sick mind this is not surprising when you consider that it deals with pedophilia stalkers and masturbation among numerous other things now that its been four years the firestorm has simmered down and we can view the film through a much more objective lens bottom line is it a good movie for the most part yes it is despite some of the potentially distasteful subject matter its a solid character study offering an honest realistic look at suburban loneliness and alienation even at their worst the characters are not judged the director simply allows their actions to speak for themselves no matter how much we may despise some of their actions we never see them as monsters but as genuine human beingssolondz brings out nothing but the best from his diverse cast dylan baker tackles the most difficult role but also the most contradictory one on the surface he is a loving family man and a successful doctor but hes also a closet pedophilewhose next victim is destined to be his sons friend it would be easy for us to condemn him as a monster but he allows us to see the humanity in his character despite his fatal flaws he is still a complete human being not an evil person but certainly a deeply troubled one he does the unthinkable compelling us to root for his character to escape discovery i freely admit this is troublingno one with a conscience would not be botheredbut this successfully demonstrates what can be done with a talented performer and director likewise jane adams and philip seymour hoffmann are deadon as lonely unhappy individuals some movies might see them as targets as ridicule but shows that such a pathetic existence is no laughing matter although there is a bit of humor every now and thenadmittedly the director isnt much of a visual stylist but that doesnt have a significance effect on the film he is excellent with his actors and his screenplay and surehanded direction guide us through multiple plot threads without ever losing the audience the only thing that doesnt quite work is the subplot with louise lasser as the elderly housewife with marital troubles lasser turns in a solid performance but her story seems more like an afterthought to the main trio still its a worthwhile effort overall its a film deserving of a second chance out of released by good machine international,black_comedy
as an openminded and liberal person i am surprised at myself that i did not like this movie more but this movie was so unsettling it really bothered me  it really was almost too disturbing too enjoy i cant really pinpoint my feelings any more than that it did not wig me out and it was well written and acted but i really didnt like watching it and probably would not watch it again is this subject matter funny not to me not great but definitely worth talking about overall i rate the movie about a 6 for solondzs solid directing and the believable acting with a few points deducted for the excessive subject matter which i found personally unpleasant and mildly distasteful,black_comedy
turn over a rock and what do you see a misnomer if ever there was one because nobody in this dreary tale of woe is remotely happy a chain of sad empty pointless lives even the sad obscene telephone caller cannot or will not kcuf his victim even when she calls him back and asks him to i ended up watching this in fast forward in the desperate hope that something interesting might happen this was one of those movies where i really couldnt have cared less about the people in they totally failed to engage my interest what a waste of my time and their talent i really wouldnt bother oh and i love peter greenaways movies and this piece of tedious tosh in no way compares to his stuffbtw if one cannot quote from the movie when reviewing it what is the point of this site,black_comedy
this could have been a welldirected piece outlying sexual depravity in all its forms and how the certain characters quest for need is paramount to their need for but this doesnt happen  instead solondz tries to shock tries to disturb the audience with the taboos of masturbation and pedophelia but never allows the audience to care for or even understand the characters  instead all thats portrayed are boring cliches that are presented in little sketches  this movie is unimpressive and not worth the time todd solondz should leave movies on new jersey life in the morethan capable hands of kevin smith,black_comedy
this movie was not just bad it was an abomination that actually made the stupids starring tom arnold seem like a deep worthwhile film in comparison filled with just about every perversion imaginable including a father whos a closet pedophile and secretly lusts after his young sons friends ive heard this movie called a black comedy but there was nothing even remotely funny about it kids are used as props for running gags or worse throughout the film every person in this film is so completely selfish and devoid of depth that they make you long for the quiet dignity of pauly shores characters the plot line is ridiculous and offensive oh yes and the ending has not one redeeming quality but other than thatgreat filmin all seriousness this stunningly horrible film is one that you should avoid at all costs if you find yourself so desperate for entertainment that youre considering renting this movie may i suggest that you take a trip to your local laundramat instead there you will be able to watch clothes dry through little round glass windows an endeavor that i promise you will be far more interesting and amusing than viewing ever could be,black_comedy
this movie is absolutely wrong  i am by no means an extremely moralistic person  i could forgive the movie entirely if it were to omit the pedofile portion  even the ending disgusting as it was i could live with and i wouldnt say anything bad about the movie the performances were fine  i would never recommend that anyone see this movie  i think i am now worse off after seeing this movie,black_comedy
why does it seem a movie that has all the quality of a very well put together movie needs to have ingredients like child molestation to get attention  this movie has nothing in it but trash  all told though it was well put together,black_comedy
that is by far the most awful movie ive ever seen i admit it takes something to bring to life such a perfect picture of perversion and sickness but for what  seeing that movie is like watching a pile of crap and enjoying its smell for more than 2 hours that one leaves nothing but a bad taste in your mouth and the wish to forget about it asap where american beauty had something strange but still sympathetic this one has got nothing it is just a picture of the scum of some sick and frustrated dudes mind the picture the director is painting here is worse than the most perverted mind could ever imagine that movie doesnt do any good in any way the only thing one has to admit is the incredible sickness and unthe incredible frustration that the characters of that story live in and how that is brought to the viewer by the movie but it still was one of the most awful movies ive ever seen in my whole life and that comes from a guy who loved twin peaks american beauty and most admired the brutality of schindlers list because at least in that movie there was a sense the sense of showing people how to make the future better than the past but erases all hope to make anything better its just a story of a bunch of people facing nothing but the absolute bottom of social life and a director who himself seems to enjoy stirring in human excrement up to the very last detailmy respect to the actors though must have taken a lot especially to the children playing that hard stuffbut why spent 2h15 just to see everything that makes you sad everyday anyway that you will never be able to change and that is so unhappy that you would never even think about making fun of it ,black_comedy
this is the worst movie i have ever seen or almost sawi would like to comment more but i walked out after ten  minutes its not the material that was disturbing it was the obvious attempt to take material that might upset people and pass it off as writing its right up there with dancer in the dark as being stupid and contrived,black_comedy
this is not just a horrible film it is a mean spirited and hateful film as wellthere are some others on this board who already hit it on the head this movie is not some realistic portrait of suburban life its self indulgent crap dressed up as art the same people that buy paintings from serial killers sit around coffee shops discussing this film as if it is deep and meaningfulso little todd got beat up by the football players in high school wawa waa  get over the wedgie you got in the locker room and maybe youll be able to capture the promise you showed with welcome to the dollhouse,black_comedy
this movie is terribly awful my husband had to leave the room he was so disgusted he tried convincing me multiple times to just turn off the movie i stayed and watched hoping for some redeeming quality and at the end i found there is none it has officially hit as my number one worst movie of all time from sexual perversions and twisted lives even as a dark comedy this is not a funny movie yes it has a long list of excellent actors but do not be duped like i was the overall acting was good but in my opinion  is there really a point in watching a movie when the story line is subpar my overall assessment is this dont waste your time is an awful movie,black_comedy
this film is about a dysfunctional family and other unconventional individuals they all have worries or perversions of their ownneedless to say the plot is very dark and disturbing it brutally explores loneliness insecurities lack of self confidence and sexual perversions mona going to the estate agents is a scene that cries out her desperate loneliness joy is constantly sad but pretends not to be philip seymour hoffman is quite amazing as a sexual pervert the most disturbing thing though is the final scene when dr maplewood is asked by his son abut his alleged pedophilia i wonder what does the child actors parents think when they learnt of their son having to say such lines is certainly not a happy film it makes people think what is or whether they are happy or not maybe it is this satirical reason that makes it captivating,black_comedy
all i can say about is im proud of myself for not walking outi guessi thought this film despite the excellent acting was simply disturbing  i dont think it could figure out what message it wanted to send so decided to simply push the envelope as far as it possibly couldif you are disturbed by pedophelia boyrape and come shots then definitely dont seethe disappointing thing is this film could have done a good job telling the everyman story of how no one in suburbia is truly happybut it just went too overboard,black_comedy
solid acting and expert directing make a quality film if though it is supposed to be a social study it fails miserably these people are way too neurotic and problematic to be real the only way i can appreciate this film is as a comedy and its a really good one american beauty is a fine example of a more plausible social study without abandoning the comic feel,black_comedy
save your breath im one of the most bleeding heart liberals youll ever meet that being said i found this movie to be one of the stupidest most offensive degrading movie i have ever seen first of all pedophilia in my opinion is one of those things that just should not be played for laughs end of story especially when the crime occurs when a father drugs his sons friend what really disgusted me about this movie was the way the director worked with this tone of classist elitist arrogance somewhere along the way people decided that it was okay to mock the working middle class of america its one thing when the person speaking is a member of the community under attack but when its perpetrated by a bunch rich white brats thinking how funny it is to play lowerclass this mean all you truck driver cap wearing snots all this did was attempt to show how stupid perverted and ignorant those who have less than todd s are,black_comedy
the movie focuses on the lives of a family of five these five individuals each have their problems in their own lives the issues explored by the film include loneliness sexual frustration rejection and a general sense of disillusionment in life what is our purpose how do we attain what was intriguing about the film was the way these topics were approached scenes include paedophilia murder infidelity and a lot of masturbation it is not a sordid film but it is controversial it purports to show human dissatisfaction and pain and suffering it is not a film for a friday or saturday night with your partner or friends i recommend watching this on your own when you have time to yourselfthe film has emotional depth and has a lot of truth about what it is like to be unhappy and lonely i think most of us watching this by ourselves would be able to relate this film to some of our own fears and insecurities though obviously not expressed in such extreme and disturbing ways it makes you question life a little it is not about but quite the opposite however the unof people and society is expressed in a humorous light worth watching but be warned  the themes goes beyond normal boundaries,black_comedy
will probably be one of those movies that goes down in history as one of the top five movies that splits the public focusing on several sexually screwedup people in new jersey the movie tries to be as gross as possible and succeeds unfortunately director todd solondz could have used these stories to show how the characters change over time but the characters never change theyre all sexually screwedup and they stay like that i guess that in real life some people do stay like that but it seems to me that a movie should show people going through a change jane adams jon lovitz philip seymour hoffman lara flynn boyle dylan baker louise lasser and ben gazzara all do the best that they can in their respective roles but solondz has a very weird grasp of everything,black_comedy
so so sad extremely disgusting yet joyful beautiful people who have been working with me and i love the way you love me a lot of people,black_comedy
whoa and wow pulls no punches it examines the lives of various people are any of these people you the guy down the hall too weird to talk to the girl he thinks hes in love withwill he stalk her for his own the pedophile man who likes little boys will he give in to his own sexual gratificationfor his own simply put examines the lives of people situations and circumstances which finds the viewer unsettled and a bit uncomfortable in case you do not understand why this is happening its because this film plays out almost perfectly on your raw emotions it also gives a very brutal look at how we just feed off each other like cannibals to get what we want in life the film can be very depressing at times it doesnt really work as a comedy although some may be misled by the fact that it falls in this genre no no this one must be taken seriously so i cant caution you enough to please be prepared for some very disturbing scenes this is a solid piece of work a little ahead of its time and i assure you this is not suitable for children 17 or younger so keep them away from this trust me i know whats suitable and whats not this is a nc17 film you are warned,black_comedy
is a brilliant and deviant piece of incredible film making by director todd solondz this dark comedy masterpiece was highly recommended by friends that have seen it and it holds up really well this centers on 3 sisters and their absolutely dysfunctional family this takes a unflinching look at just how disturbing life in suburban america can be predates american beauty by a year and is such a profoundly disturbing original and thought provoking experience in cinema that is absolutely uncompromising and strong in its presentation of the darkest corners of suburbia the movie is very clever and wickedly funny the dialouge is brilliant and performances are magnificent from the ensemble cast many of which would go on to be big stars like philip seymour hoffman is not a mainstream movie by any means and wont appeal to everybody however is very well made and i think the film is outstanding,black_comedy
i liked in some weird way this movie is really interesting to watch despite all those disturbing scenes it has you just cant stop watching until its done you wanna see whats gonna happen next for that alone i give it 9 but because of some nasty things in the movie gotta lower the grade by 18,black_comedy

similar to how movie critics make something relevant all of sudden they will likely to do this to movie primarily because its dark and honest and really beat many other movie to that weird indiedarkmumblecore bullshit im mainly putting this hear so i have proof later to call reddit and other stupid movie lovers on their bullshit of following whatever hollywood tells them is goodits a good film that will get its mainstream praise eventually its just thats is already good it doesnt need mainstream praise if some movie critic in the future brings this movie out to the public eye again it will only be because they are trying to seem more informative and trying to making a name for themselves,black_comedy
this isnt such a bad film the topic it explores is quite obvious which is the perversions brought on by an environment of social alienation it is interesting to see how social interaction plays out in such an environment one point that is stressed is that the common person is suffering neurosis and humanity as a whole  the general populace  have produced an environment that does not nurture the human being people everywhere are slipping through the cracks it is a far reaching point to make this film is by no means humorous i dont believe i laughed once it is a film that is sad poignant and disturbing i believe the characters are portrayed in a way that stirs our sympathy but curiously it is also presented in such a way that we can stand back and look upon it objectively and see the situation as it is  that is quite a nice balancing trick by the director or writers or whoever to at the same time move us sympathetically and also unemotionally objectively i felt like i came to care for these characters and could see where there suffering was coming from there were brief moments where two characters found comfort in another and the distance between them had been overcome but alas such moments did not last this film carries a message that is to be more open more honest more caring with one another to somehow develop our sympathy for each other and bridge the gap that exists between us,black_comedy
love the title is a film thats all too real its sick shocking funny sad inspiring provocative controversial evocative disgusting the list goes on but like the emotions listed above most are negative some touching places you dont wont to go theres so many things we can relate with whether puberty disappointment denial rage anger and we have a brilliant cast of a actors to demonstrate these feelings and emotions the first one to spring to mind is philip seymour hoffman an amazing actor whos dull apathetic voice fits his flawed semi psychotic lonely shell of a man who stalks women by telephone using smutty messages and im not even gonna tell ya what he does with postcards this is just one character most of them have issues but with the rest whose lives may seem picture perfect they too arent content but what is anyhow is there such a thing basically this 140 minute movie i love that never seems like 140 minutes is set around the lives of three sisters and people they associate with whether family new loves stalkers other sick puppies dumped ugly guys etc the only person whos really all together until a shocking revelation throws her world into a hundred and eighty degree spin is the oldest of the sisters lifes pretty peachy creamy for the second oldest too but fame can come at a price while the youngest a lonely budding singerguitarist in need of you know what is quite a mess while watching this movie itll jangle some nerves touch upon sensitive spots in scenes that are all too real some may be too real where we keep relating with more of them as the movie progresses its as if reality keeps kicking back at us like a drug thats its genius one scene reminiscent of port arthur and thank god this was just an imaginary scene has disturbed psychiatrist dylan baker strolling through central park gunning down people at random with an a47 where at the end of it all he seems totally disaffected like this scene a couple of other scenes go a bit too far some of them involving pedophilia but these recurring issues we cant turn blinders too is a sheer 1999 masterpiece and deserves its place among that years top ten films though its not for all tastes or maybe even more accurately put it may just be for acquired tastes this movie will leave you shocked sickened where you may even feel the need to vomit or you may just find it inspirational and that itself is rewarding i know the latter is a hard concept to grasp but you have to read between the lines and realize that out there in the big lonely world theres always gonna be someone whos far worse off than you,black_comedy
the whole movie is about characters looking for something in their lives and nobody finds anything they are all alone with their view of the world and everyone has facade that breaks down as the movie moves along my favorite character is probably the fat pervert seymour hoffman plays the relationship he has with his unattractive neighbor is probably the most moving thing about the movie they would fit together perfectly but still in this movie there is no room for all i can say i can only recommend that movie it was one of the best movies i watched for a long time and it is not difficult to get into this movie because it is very entertaining and funny as well,black_comedy
i never enjoyed watching this movie i laughed a few times but it was more because the situations the characters were in were so uncomfortable overall that is not necessarily a bad thing the bad thing about the movie is that is filled with interesting characters that you tend to get invested into but then you spend too much time aware from them while spending time with other characters you would almost forget about a character and all of sudden they were backi honestly enjoyed all of the acting especially dylan baker jane adams and lara flynn boyle so dylan baker managed to play a sympathetic pedophile or as sympathetic as they can be his conversations with his son were some of the most awkward but somehow endearing i loved lara flynn boyles character she was just over the top enough that she seemed to fit in atmosphere created by solondz i think i have a crush on jane adams now for me she was extremely relatable but at the same time kind of frustrating as a character you just wanted to shake her and yell at her to get her life together but then hold her and try to make her happy she probably would break my heart just like lovitz character thoughoverall the movie is probably filled with some terribly awkward moments that are funny but in an uncomfortable kind of way the movie did not flow from one characters arc to another i forgot about the characters as the movie went a long which is even more frustrating because so many of the characters are interesting and i wanted to spend time with them but being away from any given character for as long as you are makes it hard to invest in the characters in any meaningful way it is an ok movie that i probably not recommend to anyone except possibly for the overarching concept of and what it means to different people and how some dont know what it means to themselves that was interesting but with such a terrible flow it made it hard to stay interested in anyone characters,black_comedy
the story of three grown sisters adams boyle and stevenson their parents gazzara lasser and the colorful yet dark characters that find their way into each of the five jordan family members everyday life the five main characters are somewhat of an oasis in the film being the most normal and least dark of all the other characters which gives us breathing room to absorb the sinister characters that surround them funny disturbing and eyeopening the concept character interaction and dialogue are wonderful while unpleasant and at many times vulgar in the end it is a truly remarkable film out of four,black_comedy
strips reality bare it shows us how the world really is shocking us out of any cosy bigoted notions about life and people which we might havei wont go into the plot in detail because that would be going over what you already know for those who have seen it and spoiling it for those who havent lets just say it follows the three jordan sisters of new jersey trish whose psychiatrist husband bill is secretly a paedophile and budding child rapist helen who is being stalked by the lonely sexobsessed allen and joy who gets a job teaching newly arrived immigrants in nyc and starts an affair with one of them only for him to emerge as a thief who is only after her money theres also the sisters parents lenny and mona who have retired to florida and are now splitting up after decades of marriagethe theme of ostensibly appears to be the idea that middleclass suburban society is not what it seems there is perversion lurking behind every door and the perfect family man living next door to you could in fact be a paedophile and a rapist as bill says to joe grasso at one point in the film appearances can be deceptive this is doubtless a genuine theme which solondz wanted to express but i feel that it goes deeper than thisi think what solondz was really trying to do in was to tear down our ideas about morality in people are shown as they really are not divided off into the black and white realms of good and evil as bigots tend to see people twists normal ideas of good and bad beyond recognition the most obvious example would be the character of bill  he is a paedophile but is shown not to be a monster but a caring father who is deeply tormented by his own urges but the character of allen is another good example  he may immediately strike us as a pervert but he turns out to have a caring side as shown when he gives kristina a tissue and offers to take her out kristina is obsessed with allen and is stalking him just as allen is himself stalking helen  by showing a stalker with a stalker solondz shows us the relativity of morality and one womans stalker is another womans stalking victim the real world is not a black and white one of evil stalkers and good victims  it is much more complex composed of subtle shades of grey kristina goes on to reveal to allen that she killed pedro the doorman who raped her when she asks allen if they can still be friends allen says i guess yeah i mean everyone has their you know their pluses and minuses this reiterates the same theme of moral relativism  the world is not neatly divided into camps of good and evil were all on the same scale and the most evil person in the world has good in them just as the most good person in the world has evil in themanother theme in is that of determinism  the idea that people do not choose their actions and they cannot therefore be held morally responsible for them confessing his paedophilia to his son billy bill explains his actions by saying i couldnt help myself a line that has already be spoken by kristina and is it me or does billy look like a young allen billy and allen are also both obsessed with masturbating is solondz saying that billy has been turned into a pervert like allen by the trauma of discovering his fathers paedophilia whether determinism is right or wrong it is undeniable that people are often forced into unpleasant situations by prior circumstances  so it is hard to impose judgement on themin it in fact becomes impossible to impose judgement on anyone what ultimately presents to us is a total moral nihilism  good and bad do not exist there is only and more often suffering its not that there is perversion lurking behind every door its that there are no perverts normality and perversion good and bad do not refer to anything at all whether solondz is correct about that or not it is certainly a view of the world to which i can relatenow it may be possible to criticise as being too pessimistic as offering no solutions to the problems of life which it highlights but the fact is that there often are no solutions is a film which above all remains true to reality and in reality there are often no solutions to the great deal of suffering in life so why watch it the answer is that is against all the odds not a depressing film despite the unpleasant events with which it deals solondz makes it a very funny and humane film i actually find it quite a therapeutic film to watch when i am down in that it lays bare the problems of life and changes my perspective on them helps me take a more philosophical attitude to things and a less judgemental attitude to other people by dealing with the problems of life so candidly the film is actually one of the few things that has come out of a human mind which actually transcends those problems it is like an island of humour and wisdom in a world full of suffering and madness solondz said the following about his film welcome to the dollhouse but it could apply equally well to the film is a comedy because that is the only way i know how to deal with excruciating torment and i find something both funny and poignant in the struggle to endure humiliation,black_comedy
i am a fan of black comedies and i usually try to get my hands on any i can find but it surprised me how everyone kept telling me how deeply disturbing this film is i am a very easily affected person so i naturally shyed away from this particular film i also kept hearing that this was a great movie experience albeit the disturbing content so i finally caved in and bought it one daymy best friend who also enjoys black comedies came over to watch it with me and throughout the two hours it lasts we both sat nailed to our seats alternately laughing our heads off and gasping in amazement and horror at the situations therein by the end we could do nothing but admit that while it is indeed disturbing it is perhaps one of the best black comedies weve ever seenits about three sisters joy who just broke up with her loser boyfriend and throughout the film tries to maintain a dimwitted sunny side amidst gutwrenchingly depressing situations and encounters theres also helen a famous and gorgeous writer who writes dark poems and who aims to have an affair with a repulsively twisted and obscene caller and theres trish a housewife who pretends to be perfect and to have it all while her respectable husband indulges in a terribly disturbing maniathroughout the film these three sisters and the rest of the characters with which they are connected slowly and excruciatingly tumble into a downward spiral of depression subtly yet savagely exposing the socalled perfection of middleclass the title of the film is of course ironic so you might probably guess the general tone of the filmit is a depressing film it is shocking and disturbing but it also is undeniably funny todd solondz has masterfully found a way to unite a crude portrayal of the darker side of life with witty and hilarious dialogue youll laugh and feel disgusted simultaneously youll laugh at things you would never even think of laughing about and you will most definitely have mixed feelings about it by the end but if theres one thing that youll definitely agree with is that you have just experienced a piece of life savagely honest however crude and evil it might be and youll also agree that the aim of the film apart from exposing the truth we usually try to shield our eyes from is to demonstrate how opposite feelings really do exist in lifethis film is not for the faintminded but for those of you who approach it with an open mind and an artistic sense youll find youll be rewarded with an incredibly good movie experiencerating 3 stars and a half out of 4,black_comedy
one of the most original american films in years todd solondz directs with aplomb for subject matter that audiences and filmmakers alike often reject only neil labute david lynch and terry zwigoff come immediately to mind as directors not only willing to take on such material but present it in nonexploitative fashion the film is about an older bickering couple who have fallen out of love and their three daughters lives however the film focuses primarily on their sexual hangups and their inabilities to function in relationships in general in doing so writerdirector todd solondz creates a portrait of very dysfunctional and depraved individuals who are at once hilarious interesting pathetic and sad but above all humanthe ensemble cast is flawless throughout the film louise lasser is perfect as the insecure nagging bitch of a wife from whom ben gazzara wants to flee when he does get away briefly with elizabeth ashley he has the funniest scene in the film romping with ashley in heat and suddenly declaring he doesnt feel anything the ambiguity of the scene is not lost on the viewer human beings who have lost the ability or never had it to connect with others emotionally and intellectually feel nothing eitherthe three sisters are as different as the three actresses that play them cynthia stevenson is married to pedophile dylan baker only she doesnt know about it yet she presents herself as the smugly superior sister who has it all only she doesnt realize her whole life is about to crumble unfortunately she is the only character the film does not expose like the others dylan baker as her husband fights a losing battle with pedophilia and his hopelessly misguided son obsesses about masturbationlara flynn boyle is also well cast as the selfcentered cruel emotionally dead sister who craves any sexual excitement crossing her path watch her interact with and comment about both sisters stevenson and jane adams and her selfcenteredness and cruelty are readily apparent her scenes with philip seymour hoffman a neighbor are equally funny and pitiful hoffman plays a sexually frustrated obscene phone caller who can not bring himself to approach women in person boyle frustrates him as he frustrates her inadvertently camryn manheim enters the picture as an even more sexually whacked out neighbor than hoffmanthe film begins with the third sister played by jane adams meeting her latest loser boyfriend jon lovitz in a restaurant when a break up occurs when lovitz sees through her insincerity and lack of empathy he chastises her openly adams subsequently and spontaneously gets involved with a russian immigrant who is a thief jared harris adams is emotionally and physically abused throughout the film shes a poster child for people who do not have a clue about their own lives and why things are going the way they aresolondz does not act condescending or judge individuals but merely demonstrates that is relative and temporal many scenes are difficult and painful to watch those viewers obsessed with judging others or their sexual proclivities will want to avoid this film those viewers who like challenging thoughtprovoking material may still find the film hardgoing but ultimately entertaining interesting and rewarding its a melange of human alienation depravity desperation and selfabsorption riding on an interpersonal carousel to nowhere its definitely not a date movie and the title is most ironic 12 of 4 stars,black_comedy
i like so much this movie i found it very funny dark humor and so wonderful acting philip seymour hoffman was supperb although this was the first time i saw him acting i think that from here it was obvious one of the most talented actors in the state the scrip was amazing some cons i found a little bit confusing the reaction of the psychiatric son when he asked him about if he had thought about having sex with him that was the lowest part of the movie the child cry with the answer but it was not convincing i like the rest of the acting this is the only part of the movie that i really did not like it is a great movie in spite of the short funding they had with a better photography this could become a real classic,black_comedy
is an unusually dark comic tale from writer  director todd solondz dealing with the personal lives of three middle class sisters the film soon enters dark territory yet retains its ability to amuse as well as shockphilip seymour hoffman is on top form as the deep breathing phone menace allen who will soon meet equally mixedup individuals in his apartment block dylan baker plays the paedophile bill maplewood with chilling realismat the end of the day though this is the tale of three sisters and the performances from the leading ladies are excellent jane adams cynthia stevenson and lara flynn boyle are very believable in their roles and the viewer is gripped by their separate plot lines7 out of 10,black_comedy
is a great film butfirst of alli have to say this is not for everybodythe film has hard themes which maybe will disgust some sensitive peoplethe best thing about this movie is the way in which the hard themes are executed and the story is developed with a lot of intelligencethis is one of those films that challenge the spectator and i find that totally greatthe performances are excellent but the performance which i liked more was dylan bakers which was totally ignored by the pathetic oscarsis not easy to watchbut i have to say its a great movie with a lot of intelligence and thats something weird on modern movies,black_comedy
this film deftly knocks countless holes in the american dream in all its conceits rarely ever seen in us cinema especially in this era of trash and glitter the foils are three sisters whose lives run the gamut from malaise to suburban glee but to say remains elusive among all three is a slight understatement adding to their troubles are the people around them who both mirror and amplify their lack of contentment what could be called bad behavior isnt done arbitrarily or viciously rather good intentions gone real bad therein dwells the irony and wry dark humorvery shakesperean the characters script scenes and editing make this a gem note this isnt a disney film and nor is it about happy people well maybe one person finds it,black_comedy
when my friend let me borrow this video he warned me that others he had watched it with were genuinely angered for being exposed to it i cant say that i dont understand whythis film deals with suicide murder masturbation rape pedophilia sexual frustrationyou know sordid and filthy goingson that most of you dont want to hear aboutoh and i must not forget the demonstration on the amazing adhesive powers of semen however although it was almost an emotional ordeal to watch i must admit that i truly enjoyed this film there is enough sick humor involved to keep a dedicated viewer from being completely appalledthough dedicated is sort of a relative term the acting is superb phillip seymour hoffman does a nauseatingly good job at portraying a pudgy pasty perverse cubicaldweller john lovittsiswelljohn lovitts in my twisted opinion the best scene is of course the lasta powerful example of why you should never ever ever trust the tongue of a dog to put it simply if your ideal movie is something along the lines of the wizard of oz or other pgorlower tripe this film will leave a profoundly bad taste in your mouthand thats assuming you dont even finish watching but if you have a high tolerance for anything that usually causes people to exclaim something along the lines of oh dear godthat phrase ran through my head several times you may enjoy it,black_comedy
is the tale of three sisters an actress a livewithparents musician and a married woman each of them has problem with their love life some more than others also stars jon lovitz philip seymour hoffman and dylan baker and ben gazzara best known to me as jackie treehorn from the big lebowski the film excels because the stories overlap yet continue in a linear fashion this adds to the strength of the themes being different but still connecting for example one sister is married to a psychiatrist the psychiatrist is the doctor for hoffman who makes obscene phone calls to another sister the actress lara flynn boyle the doctor of course has no knowledge that this mans fantasy is his sisterinlawthe film is also quite funny as evidenced by the casting of lovitz who opens up the film in a very dry bit of realism and to a lesser degree hoffman who is not always funny but is known for his quirky supporting roles like again the big lebowski in other scenes the humor is very dark and will not appeal to most of the people out there with masturbation stalking and pedophilia being the running themes you can understand many might be offendedi for one appreciate the way the material was handled it wasnt funny to the point of being a grossout comedy like waiting or dramatic to the point of being a lifetime movie i found the portrayal of pedophilia to be lifelike as much as i can assume this and this really drives the film home emotionally criminals and the mentally ill are not monsters but human beings and they have families that are hurt by their actionsi would encourage you to see this film i think the key demographic would be people aged 2030 possibly more men than women but if youre openminded you will appreciate this film and the message it has also if youve seen the directors other movie welcome to the dollhouse you know what to expect,black_comedy
i watched this film as a seventeen year old and remembered only that it was depressing but hilarious when i watched it again tonight i couldnt stop thinking about goodfellas and how closely twinned these two movies are they might seem totally disparate butthey are both long films that feel much shorter than their running time both contain horrible events that you cant avert your eyes from and both are entirely without redemption just as we leave henry hill full of regrets and boredom so too do we leave the three luckless sisters around whose lives revolves  joy helen and trish  with unfulfilled dreams and licking male bodily fluids from a dogs mouthperhaps theyre not as alike as i first thought,black_comedy
todd solondzs masterpiece was released the same year that sam mendes american beauty won the oscar as the years best film however there is no way solondzs film would ever win oscars in this film a kind husband and loving father drugs and rapes his preteen sons preteen school friends a lonely woman kills the elderly janitor who rapes her and dismembers his body and a lonely bachelor masturbates while making obscene phone calls is anything but conventional in its study of dysfunctional america what makes the film so funny and so shocking is the empathy solondz displays towards his characters the more appalling their behaviour they more sympathetically are they portrayed the child rapist is a case in point solondz never shys away from the enormity of the mans crimes nor does he seek to excuse them but neither does he present us with a monster in dylan bakers stunning performance we see beyond the characters selfconfessed sickness and can identify with and understand the basic simplistic kindness of the man the film is not an apology for child abuse but a matteroffact almost clinical observation of an everyday child abuserthen there is philip seymour hoffmans obscene phonecaller whose sad masturbatory existence is blown apart when he finally hits the jackpot and calls the woman of this dreams from across the hall and awakens in her the need for a fantasy rape shes a poet who writes about being abused in her childhood when of course she never was the same poet is one of three sisters another is married to the child rapist and it is they and their relationship that make up the fundamental backbone of the movieall the performances are magnificent though it is hoffman and baker by the very nature of their characters that tend to overshadow those around them and naturally any film that deals so frankly with the subject of paedophilia and ends when an 11 year old boy jerking off finally comes is bound to be controversial but what makes it essential viewing and the masterpiece i genuinely believe it to be is solondzs heartfelt belief in the frailty and decency of all of his characters and his desire to get to the bottom of what it is that makes all of us the way we are,black_comedy
you know this movie is great it has some performances to die for some of the most awkward and dry humor out there is simultaneously hilariously funny and deeply disturbing and has relatable characters that one can either recognize or realize chillingly exist right next door or sometimes in your very own houseits a really great movie especially utilizing todd solontz particular brand of suburbia mentality its just that he didnt know where to stop mostly his relationships in this film are great going in surprising directions and ultimately very telling about the type of person hes trying to createbut honestly did we even need any of the sidestory about the parents every time we got back to them i got the distinct feeling that this was five ten fifteen minutes id be not watching other better more interesting characters develop also the fat lady neighbor ultimately her story came out in the end and became worth it but it was the most predictable and least tightly defined of all the charactersi think todd solontz got a little into big cast syndrome without actually having a hugely recognizable cast save hoffman and boyle to express as much widespread loneliness as possible but didnt think about how much that may weigh down the otherwise biting and inyourface social commentaryit was a great movie but it could have been even betterpolarisdib,black_comedy
what a brilliant moviefirst thing ive seen dealing with pederasty in such a non judgemental way and done with a lot of humourthe movie stays with you for a whilei look forward to seeing more of this directors workloved ps hoffmann as alwayshas he ever done anything that isnt terrificliked the connection of all the characters which is always a potent device in moviesbrings to mind pulp fictioncrimes and misdemeanors and short cuts three great movies that also leave you wanting a little more at the endloved ben gazarra as the father who doesnt seem to know where his life is at and seems to end up with his wife and family anywaythis is a movie that poses questions which is about the best thing a movie can do fantastic,black_comedy
i was very reluctant about seeing this film considering how much i hated welcome to the dollhouse and make no mistake about it i hated welcome to the dollhouse more than roger ebert hated north my mind was set at ease from the opening scene where we meet jon lovitzs character set to get his poor heart broken great more heaping of crap on the weak i was thinking then out of nowhere jon not only ends up not getting crapped on but ends up the one who heaps the crap with this one scene i forgave todd for dollhouse and went on to enjoy 2plus hours of wonderfully dark humor unlike the open cruelty of dollhouse presents its characters in a sympathetic light and while it lets its characters have their small victories theyre neither forced or compromised attempts to please the audience perhaps todd took a long hard look at dollhouse and said maybe i should put some comedy in my dark comedies better late than never todd keep up the good work aminus,black_comedy
1997 todd solandz has done two of my favorite films this one and welcome to the dollhouse dollhouse is the definition of junior high hell well take all the episodes of leave it to beaver distill them pour into a fine toxic waste storage cask allow to age 50 years behind a porno store and you get this incredibly witty but very dark horror of a fauxcomedy solandz stomping ground is suburbia and he seems to be real mad at it adults are predators children are food dens are lairs and whitebread snacks are laid upon waiting traps no one under 18 should see this and no one with a delicate sensibility the sets costuming and scoring add greatly to the overall impact of this nightmare the dialog silences acting layered roles all done superbly casting was amazing ironies abound contrasts are everywhere this is a painful terrible horrifying wonderful film,black_comedy
ill admit this film really does go over the top but thats what makes it such a hit a lot of people im sure would be absolutely disgusted by this film people with closed minds that dont understand that there really are people like this in the world and it isnt just a conjured up twisted proportion of someones mental reality i think it was extremely brave of todd solondz to have made this film and it deserves all the positive feedback it gets those of you that dont understand the reasoning and utter awesomeness of this film with its artistically overly graphic content should go back to watchingstewart littleandsuch,black_comedy
this is a film that is great on so many levelson one level it is an excellent commentary on our perceptions of sex and political correctness and of on another level it is a commentary on generational politics between the idealistic pretendingtobefunctional baby boom the lost and disillusioned generation x and the confused and materialistic generation y on the most sentimental level for me it is an excellent portrayal of new jersey and what makes it tick todd solondz grew up a few towns away from me and it captures the damaged perfectionism and subtle quirky lunacy of new jersey and also its perverse beauty more than any movie i can think of garden state says nothing about my home state it is not for the squeamish but it bursts through the issues with excellent acting and it is meant to make the viewer really think about their preconceptions besides child molestation the most talkedabout controversial subject in solondz also rips through pretentious artists divorce and the depression of the elderly immigration and everything about romance and rejection i cant think of a better movie of the past ten years maybe with the exception of boogie nights,black_comedy
from directorwriter todd solondz this is a well acted and well scripted controversial black comedy it focuses on the lives of a group of men and women who engage in shocking antisocial behaviour the title by the way is a joke but theres also a song called and the last scene theres a toast to the shocking behaviour includes obscene phone calls by allen capotes philip seymour hoffman murder and paedophilia by bill maplewood dylan baker there are also basic tragic events such as break ups bills son timmy justin elvin who wants to be a grown up by producing cum and questionable love stories this tragicomedy may have lack of moral judgement and you the audience may be the ones to make your own minds up about the events but there are still plenty of giggles in the sick circumstances and you can feel pity and get drawn in to most of the peoples lives also starring jane adams as joy jordan jon lovitz as andy kornbluth men in black 2s lara flynn boyle as helen jordan louise lasser as mona jordan ben gazzara as lenny jordan jared harris as vlad marla maples as ann chambeau elizabeth ashley as diane freed and molly shannon as nancy for me the most engaging stories were lonely allen calling joy and masturbating and then calling her sister helen and really letting out his sexual desires and when they actually meet they dont do it and paedophile bill who is both comforting his questioning and worrying son and he has feelings for his young best friend and there is that gripping scene where he admits to his son timmy that he fed him certainly not a film to miss it won a prize at the cannes film festival and it was nominated the golden globe for best screenplay very good,black_comedy
this is not a movie which fits a category i guess these can turn out the best there are hapiness is of course a gasser to speak a word of dean martin because none of the characters are in fact able to reach that state whatever that state of mind will be but anyone of them is trying to cope with life and to fulfill the wish of your constitution the pursuit of they are confronted over again with the vicissitudes of modern life en fail to overcome them but by doing so and bi giving us a glance in the mirror they maintain a strong will for the better of for the worse a example of the last is the tragedy of the psychiatrist and his love for boys well is it love in that sense he is a bit a sideliner and with him changes the movie in color en becomes harsh you can sympathize with the teacher en laugh about vlad your heart may beat for seymour but can you feel also pity for the psychiatrist  the movie is so good that it succeeds in this effort how is the english expression  tongue in cheek humor  well it is full of it watch it several times it gets never boring,black_comedy
i recorded this film because the radio times here in the uk had given it a 4 star rating although i like movies i had never heard of this picture before the opening scene with the two people on a first date was excellent the two actors played it to perfection i laughed out loud i dont want to spoil it for any who have not seen it but it was so human and so funny but human first we have or at least i have come to expect now nothing but superhero movies from hollywood i use that word as a catchall sorryi like superheros loved batman begins but such rather removes one from the human condition the last film that brought our condition back to me was the hours but that by comparison to this sinks like an old disney feel good all the actors are billiento the talks between father and son are the most honest that i have seen  never experienced  but also i have never seen on film either unfortunately my tape run out so i only got up to the point where the kid was being interviewed by the cops about his forgotten rape then the bloody tape ran out but i had got donny darko before that also a good movie but also again nothing compared to this piece of fine workyet i have to admit that the best moment for me was when the hysterical woman walked in and spat at the skinny girl who the fk was she i know because i have looked at the cast listing her name is hope pomerance is that some name or is it some name this is a great film a rare one that should be shown to everyonebut hope  what a woman you know when you first see someone  bang and the movie bang too,black_comedy
if you are only going to see one movie make sure it is this one punctures the perfect mask of the sick and fake society that the modern west world so desperately are trying to withhold it is the best society critic movie of all timein this movie you will meet the pedophile psychologist the emotionally disturbed author who writes erotic fiction the perfect mask building housewife with a very dysfunctional family and many othersis the essence of the society itself everything that we are trying to cover comes to surface in the movie it is highly likely that someone who normally watches movies like legally blonde would rather fast shut down but then again maybe tell the story about their lives,black_comedy
during my life ive seen a lot of pretty messed up movies i actually enjoy controversial pictures because they open my eyes and perspective about life to things id normally steer clear of well out of the thousands of films ive viewed over the thirteen years ive been watching them im fifteen i dont remember seeing a movie more messed up provocative and twisted then todd solondzs is solondzs second fulllength feature the first being the 1996 indie cult favorite welcome to the dollhouse and it puts a whole new spin on the leave it to beaverlike suburban house life this is one messed up feature film and you know what i absolutely loved itit follows the jordans a family so screwed up it makes the mansons look like the bradys the dysfunction begins with joy jordan jane adams a lonely and neurotic telemarketer who can never find a man after she breaks up with andy snls jon lovitz and he kills himself she decides to teach at a dmv while its going through a workers union strike and falls in love with a crazy russian vlad jared harris only to find out hes married the second of the jordan children is helen lara flynn boyle shes a controversial novelist who writes about issues such as violent rape and child molestation and is a sex addict shes neighbors with a fat lonely computer nerd allen philip seymour hoffman who randomly selects women out of the new jersey area phone book at attempts to have phone sex with them and a sad obese woman kristina camryn manheim with a deadly secret the third jordan child is trish cynthia stevensen the typical nosy loudmouthed and hypocritical suburban housewife whose husband bill maplewood dylan baker is a psychiatrist whose also a homosexual pedophile who dreams of mass suicide in public parks and falls in love with his 11yearold son billys rufus read best friend billy is also having a certain problem almost every teenage boy comes across and who better to talk and help him through it then his father a pedophilia maniac then comes the jordans parents mona louise lasser and lenny ben gazzara lenny tells mona he wants to split up because he isnt in love with her anymore and seeks love from a joan rivers like senior citizen diane freed elizabeth ashley mona has a hard time dealing with this and almost looses her mind hows that for a fcked up familyis almost too screwed up for words it takes all these disgusting and hard to stomach situations and puts a comical twist on them only todd solondz has the cajones to do this and i salute him for it the main attraction of course in is the writing the screenplay was the best of that year and i am absolutely appalled it didnt win any awards its very intricate bold daring and it contains some of the most original and downright frightening conversations between characters that you will ever see the acting is astounding too dylan baker gives perhaps the best performance of the film as the manic pedophile psychiatrist baker proves himself an actor in leagues of performers such as brando pacino and nicholson philip seymour hoffman is amazing as to be expected as the dirty prank callerhopeless nerd and jane adams reels you into her characters misery which is not an easy thing for any actor to do ben gazzara and louise lasser are extremely solid in their roles and camryn manheim is funny if not strange in her role lara flynn boyle amuses as helen jordan author of pornographic childhood while cynthia stevensen really makes you believe shes a you know what it starts with a b and ends with a h jared harris and jon lovitz are good in their limited screen time but elizabeth ashley kind of freaked me out maybe just her character though i didnt think too much of newcomer rufus read during the course of the film but that ending scene with him and his pedophile dad was when i realized what a brilliant young actor this kid is the directing was okay but i never really thought solondz was nearly a good director as he was writer some of it seems kind of amateurish in a way but thats not to stop you from enjoying this sick treat of a movieas far as viewing this film is concerned id say it isnt for everyone my mother thought it was a revolting piece of garbage and my soontobe brotherinlaw thought it was brilliant if you have no problem with the above issues being played out in this film id say you are fine to watch it if the above issues really get to you id say rent something like elf with will ferrell instead isnt for everyone but it was good enough for me one of the best films of 1998 grade amade my top 300 list at 55,black_comedy
the first thing you need to know about is that it isnt easy to watch its story is dark and disturbing at times but that does not mean that it isnt a good film its script is very unique it is very well written and manages to find humour in the darkest and most unexpected places i say humour but i dont really know if that is the right term it is not laugh out loud funny the humour is all very subtle and indirect and isnt created through jokes or situations but is rather created in how the situation is played out at times i even found myself laughing out of awkwardness and there are many times when i wasnt sure weather to laugh or notthe film is structured in a way that it tells several separate but interwoven stories which are all shocking and unusual is probably the most antimainstream film i have ever seen acting is great especially when you conceder just how difficult the majority of the roles must be to play dylan baker impressed me the most as there are very few actors i think would be brave enough to take that role just watch the film and you will soon understand whyis a difficult film to love as i dont think there is anyone who could watch and not find it to be disturbing but dont let that hold it back todd solondz is a talented and daring director who isnt afraid to put himself out there and make a film that is going to draw in a lot of negativity you would have to be a very narrow minded person to hate this film simply based on its shocking story line because it is a very good film it has a great script ingenious tension building direction and an outstanding cast it is a powerful and moving piece of film not soon forgotten,black_comedy
i think this movie is fabulous literally a fairy tale with figurative disembowelments as in little red hood so as any politically correct person you may not like itbut the colors oh the colors whatever you will think of this movie youll be struck by its colors crispnessthe story has as wonderfully saturated tones maybe disturbing sure but as cruelly honest as the chromatic exaggeration a fairy taleok 10 lines minimum should i put some stars out of some idiot literally again measurement system no see this movie yourself please do,black_comedy
is a terrific strange brutal and comic assault on americana it is strengthened by the superb performances of a singularly well chosen cast headed in my estimation by the surprising gruellingly honest portrayal of a striving loner and loser by philip seymour hoffman you could also apply that description to the characters played by jane adams dylan baker and many others of the fine castyeah the theme includes some shocking material but its a valuable and incisive view into a lot that is true about who we are and how we live in many ways both harsher and more droll than the profoundly unsettling welcome to the dollhouse strikes a nerve that made one of my fellow audience members say after the film i need to take a showerits deserving of the awards its received so far and worthy of more louise lasser in particular as well as hoffman and adams should receive acting awards for their ontheedgebetweenpathosandhilarity performances,black_comedy
   but it probably wont i have to say that putting saving private ryan in a category all its own this film is the best ive seen so far this year  should definitely be one of the five nominated films come oscar time  along with nods for director screenplay and in spite of the fact that there were many incredible performances in this film a nomination for dylan baker  what a performance  please hollywood take notice come nominating time,black_comedy
audiences may not be prepared for this amazing new film from director todd solondz welcome to the dollhouse but if they can get past the discussions of pedophilia and the onscreen ejaculations theyll discover a brilliantlywritten film about love and well that features some of the years best performances  three suburban sisters pursue their own separate goals while their parents marriage threatens to dissolve  by the end no ones life is as perfect or imperfect as others  or they themselves  thoughta rare american movie that challenges taboos and will encourage wildly mixed reactions from audiences  oh and did i mention that its hilarious,black_comedy
from the opening sequence looking at a bad last date to the final weird announcement at the end of the film shocked entertained and enlightened  and thats what movies can dodefinitely not for all tastesperformances are uniformly terrific  jane adams philip seymour hoffman and dylan baker doing careermaking work its a shame baker will be overlooked at oscar time because of the nature of his character elizabeth ashley in a cameo is breezy and beautiful  i wish there had been more of her character less of louise lassersits nice to see that solondz broke that sophomorefeature slump that so many other promising young filmmakers cant sustain such as soderbergh and singleton,black_comedy
i just saw for the first time last night and i want to chime in with my praise it knocked me out and i feel it is one of the greatest films of the 90sthe movie it most reminded me of in structure and cynicism is robert altmans short cuts another great film of the 90s but where altmans film was somber and made you leave the theater wanting to kill yourself solondz film makes you laugh its dark humor and cynicism recalls stanley kubricks films but where kubricks films are cold and judgmental and his characters have no redeeming qualities whatsoever solondz makes his characters likable and sympathetic despite their destructivenessthis film features at least 5 oscar worthy performances if the movie had concentrated on any one of these characters it would have been spellbinding  the performance above all performances is by dylan baker as the pedophile psychologist i dont know if ive never seen a character quite like him in any movie he is a monster but he is somehow redeemed by the fact that he clearly loves his family also creating characters that will live in my memory forever are jane adams as the loser jordan sister so funny and heartbreaking  whered she come from philip seymour hoffman as the geek who makes obscene phone calls in his spare time for his only gratification cynthia stevenson as the selfdeluding housewife who professes to have a storybook life and marriage while her husband is out diddling young boys and louise lasser as the grandmother dealing with a marital split in advanced agewhen i was watching the film i had the horrifying but probably accurate thought that this movie is probably more representative of real life than almost any other movie i have ever seenacting direction cinematography all work together as one scene after another in this film is played out to gutwrenching nervouslaughterinducing perfectionits hard to imagine todd solondz young as he is and with only 3 movies under his belt will ever top this directorial effort is a masterpiece,black_comedy
i think is a great film and should not be judged on its ability to entertain audiences  todd solonz does a brilliant job in forcing us to look into the awkward nature of human psychology from which we normally turn our heads in disgust  billing this film as a comedy would be quite a mistake but as a drama is certainly holds its own weight the scene where the father is confessing himself to his son is one of the most well done scenes ive seen in any movie to date the film is a study of life which we tend to sugarcoat all to often while audience members may cringe at some of the on screen depictions this is only because of our realization of the awkwardness of our own nature if you are planning on seeing a film for entertainment watch beauty and the beast  however if you are interested in a very well done drama about america for better or worse and have the ability to take it straight should not be missed,black_comedy
great  2 hours worth of therapy for only 7,black_comedy
i saw this film on a whim  i had gone to see something else that was sold out and this was the only other film playing  i hadnt heard anything about it and actually thought it was going to be a cartoon from the poster so you see i was totally unpreparedits kind of hard to delineate my reactions to this movie  there was no at first kind of feeling to it  it just evoked a lot of different things at the same time  specifically it disturbed me a great deal  there are things in this movie that make a person want to retch and yet they are presented in such a way so as to make one appreciate the directorial talent behind it  throughout the movie i and my companions laughed out loud though mostly from shockall in all id have to say i was severely impressed  if you have a weak stomach i wouldnt recommend seeing this movie but if youre prepared to steel yourself the acting is impeccable and the storyline is so enthralling it holds you fast until the credits roll,black_comedy
solondz seems tapped into what freud called the psychopathologyof everyday life were more people amused by the pitifulposturing common mores force so many of ustroubled confusedor frustrated as we may beinto we would be a healthiercountryi doubt this movie could have been made anywhere else as muchan inquiry into the american psyche and the zeitgeistvery muchprojected into our own timeas its a wonderful life funny andheartbreaking perhaps shocking and uncomfortable at times butnever discomfiting except perhaps to the repressed and thesanct,black_comedy
joy the adult version of weiner from welcome to the dollhouse sings a song that captures the movies essence  all the characters in this film and weiner from the previous film who also sings a happy song in the midst of suffocating depressionare longing for that elusive  the pedophile father is the most striking example of someone that is miserable in a happy environment  instead of getting help from a shrink he himself is a shrink one of many ironies in the film he has no one to go to  if the film has one true villain it is not the pedophile father but his wife her derives from seeing others suffer beneath her well constructed foundation of uppermiddle class living  solondz bangs away the point whenever something substantive appears to creep up on the conversation the wife interrupts with a have you seen leno last night  this recurring phrase from the wife echoes the older brother from welcome to the dollhouse  whenever something occurs that requires discussion or understanding he would remark that would look good on my college application  solondz truly has sympathy for these pathetic people and he even seems to offer some answers  one answer is to not turn blind eyes to people who suffer around us  again going back to the pedophile father he does not turn his son away whenever he comes with embarrassing prebuescent sexual questions  he listens and offers honest frank advices  this extends to the devastating climactic scene between the father and son when the father reveals his sickness  in the end solondz seems to be saying that perhaps the son is all the more healthy for the honest conversation the sons gleeful smile towards the end of the movie is the only genuinely happy emotion in the entire film  this is the best film of 1998 by far and i completely disagree with the comment criticizing the ben gezzara and louise lassar scenes  instead of pointlessly trying to define what effective means heshe should have at least try to understand the sadnessloss of will one might encounter in anyones twilight years  solondz has made a film that is touching yet spiced with deadly satire and even some that are laugh out loud funny,black_comedy
i have no idea what i thought about this film  i was too annoyed by the audience from the opening credits there was nothing but loud exaggerated laughter  seemed like the act of seeing a controversial art house film was more the focus than the film itself when philip seymour hoffman describes his fantasy of laura flynn boyle nothing funny has happened yet but the laughter was deafening anyone who has attended high school should be numb to this kind of dialogue and not finding it especially amusing im not knocking the film or its dialogue but the audiences inclination to laugh at naughty talk and in my opinion miss the point this is one movie i wish i had rented and watched with adults who dont snicker at the f word that said the performances were great justin elvin was incredible really liked baker hoffman adams and we really dont get to see louise lasser enough anymore,black_comedy
this is the sickest and most twisted thing ive seen this year i loved itgreeno,black_comedy
there really hasnt been a more searing portrait of loneliness that i can recall i also dont think ive ever laughed so much at whats essentially a study in claustrophobia this is what bravery in art is all about i agree that its not for everyone but i also think it can have a profound effect on how we view relationships repression and each otheroh the score was genius,black_comedy
is appearing at a moment when most people have no problem understanding bill clintons problems  at the very least todd solondz plugs into this moment with a film that portrays the obsessive quest for fulfillment through sex as desperate and pathetic does solondz feel anything for his lost lonely souls who include an obese murderess and a child molester only vaguely aware of the damage he causes the movie does project pity and horror for these people but in a way thats wan and tentative  as if solondz shares his characters inability to let go with their emotions in one postcoitum triste scene a woman tells her ineffectual lover dont feel guilty i dont feel guilty he answers i dont feel anythingis a very bleak movie youd have to go back to an artist like nathanel west who wrote miss lonelyhearts and day of the locust for a vision of north american life thats as unsparing and uncompromising like west solondz can make you laugh in the wasteland that he drops you into but the giggles catch in your throat for feel good black comedy go elsewhere,black_comedy
our criticisms of that which challenges us often reveal something about ourselves  the user who questioned the purpose of this film perhaps misses the point or purpose of the artist in general  to find and share beauty where beauty cannot be easily observed  to label any work as pornographic requires a definition of the word  that which provokes sexual arousal is the simplest  to label a work as pornographic suggests that the work provoked such arousal in oneself,black_comedy
i would count amongst the best films i have ever seen for me at least it may have forever shattered the seeming reality of the hollywood approach to story telling im afraid that everything i see for a very long time will seem phoney and trite if only the academy awards would acknowledge brilliance in such an unappealing and disturbing package ,black_comedy
walks the line between serious and tragic in every scene in a very artistic way a wonderful sense of irony  cant wait for his next movie,black_comedy
not for the feint of heart  or the moralistic  solondzs third film is brilliant  unflinchingly disgusting unrelentingly cruel terribly terribly funny  hes sharply captured the ugly desperation of being human best of all no one here tries to dictate right or wrong to the audience dont miss this one,black_comedy
after viewing this film i was angry  i cannot ever remember being that upset at a movie  while many may define my reaction as the mark of a great film i think it is a reaction to having viewed child pornographyi am offended by very very little  however i must take major exception to pedophilia played as comedy  ive heard solondz argue that his film is not comedy how then do you define the scene in which a child rapist first notices his next victim  while he lustfully stares at the 11 year old boy playing a baseball game saccharin lovestoryesque music is played underneath  or perhaps the dog lapping at semen when a 12 year old ejaculates for the first time  are these not the devices of comedy   i find them the devices of perversitybefore you condemn me as prudish let me say the vile perversity of trainspotting had me rolling in the aisles  likewise i found man bites dog to be a brilliant hilariously disturbing portrait of murder  futhermore i think blue velvet is one of the finest films ever made  what differentiates those films from  the victims are not childreni asked myself is pedophilia off limits in terms of artistic examination no i dont think it is  but it is an issue that demands the utmost in care and thought in its examination  that excludes the comedy although todd would surely say otherwise of this vile piece of filmmaking  which also brings up another issue why is todd so hung up on pubescent sexuality  for gods sake hes in his 30s get over it alreadyive never ever been a proponent of censorship  but however in this case i must applaud universal for pulling out of distributing this film  hurray for the bookburners  god i cant believe i just said that i swear ill never say it again unless of course todd decides to make ii,black_comedy
i agree with the user who recommends an oscar nomination for dylan bakers extraordinary performance unfortunately no character who is a paedophile will win an oscar for its actor no matter how good the performance is and this is probably the best ive seen all year solondzs movie is sharp and compelling although some of the character sketches he begins are left dangling a minor quibble though in that what the movie achieves far outweighs its flaws,black_comedy
here we have a good movie that makes you feel so depressed that you probably do not want to see it on the other hand it shows us real people with real emotions and real thoughts yes the thoughts and the way the characters handle to them are often wrong but you do understand them in the end you do not only feel hatred but a little sympathy as well one of the characters is bill dylan baker a child molester who is married to trish cynthia stevenson we see him as a very normal guy although a pedophile and she seems to be the happiest person in the world she seems that but in there are no happy people trish has two sisters the miserable joy jane adams who just had a breakup with andy jon lovitz a guy from her work that no one even knew and helen lara flynn boyle who thinks every man wants to sleep with her that does count for her neighbor allen philip seymour hoffman who is deeply in love with her he explains this to his shrink bill the child molester allen calls women to talk dirty to them and one day he calls helen she likes what she hears and she answers him another woman from their building kristina camryn manheim likes allen and tries to make contact the last story is about the parents of trish joy and helen who are about to separatea lot of stories combines a lot of unlike i said you probably will not want to see this there are scenes very hard to watch especially when they involve bill and a kid we dont see the times he is molesting a child but the scenes that lead up to the terrible events are very painful the final scene between bill and his oldest son is close to devastating still every single story is at least interesting probably because it involves normal people one of the characters could be your friend or neighbor and realizing that makes this movie better and interesting to watch it is unlike most movies where people who do bad things are only that here they have emotions and you are able to understand just a little why they do the things they doby the way this really is a comedy although things are painful we can laugh at most of the things we see dont think it is inappropriate to make a comedy about this subject the way it is handled is terrific,black_comedy
dylan baker is outstanding as bill maplewood who is turned on by little boys and who in the end tells his son about it can make you sick to your stomack but it is a movie that makes you consider how different we define i really like this slightly twisted movie recommendable for thinkers who wish to broaden their perspective who can honestly say that they have seen this movie without sympathizing with the woman who kills her rapist everything that these people are turned on by is very in your face but isnt that the point seriously we need to take action and get pedophilia rape and similar subjects out in the open and is a tool that can be used to start the debate,black_comedy
is a brilliant dark comedy set in new jersey and focusing on the intertangled lives of three very different sisters and their love interests as the title suggests all of the characters in this film are searching for in their own ways and none of them seem to succeed  as they are all unwittingly standing in one anothers wayjoy who appears to be the central character is a beautiful innocent but cripplingly nervous young woman who just wants to find a man  unfortunately she attracts aholes like a magnet and is dogged by the bitterness and insecurities of others throughout the film the other sisters have no more luck  one is happily married to a closet pederast hence why this is also quite a serious and disturbing film although the subject matter is dealt with excellently the other is a stunning but hopelessly selfobsessed young poet who is stalked by her obsessive nextdoor neighbourwhat makes this movie clever is how the lives of the characters are interconnected but they never realise it  for instance the obsessive neighbour sees a psychiatrist who happens to be the paedophile married to the other sister it came across to me as an american beautystyle commentary on modern life and repressed sexual desires but however you view it its a funny entertaining but also very confrontational film  i dont think ive ever seen the topic of child molesting discussed so frankly in a movie before,black_comedy
by dane youssefthe writerdirector of this one is todd solondz so you all know what to expect for those who saw his heavily acclaimed by critics and audiences alike welcome to the dollhouse a movie about the hell almighty on earth that is junior high schooli was not one of the films many admirers yes i felt like just about everybody else that the film did have some poignant truths but i pretty much already knew them all it all felt kinda redundanti was in high school at the time and every scene i was watching i thought yeah no sht and god these people are ssholes and idiots i mean i know its supposed to be a satire but i felt too much like i was watching what i already knew and thought and what has been said too many times beforehis next film about three sisters and their lives and how adulthood is more or less as mentally unbalanced as junior high school about three sisters and how their lives arent as welladjusted as they seem actually the sisters are just the core of the storylinethe seemingly ideal perfect sister is dry secretly dull and lives such a sterile life that when an obscene caller gives her an obscene call and she likes the idea of what he says so much that she starts stalking him guess she hasnt done much slumming in her lifejust thought youd all like to know what youre getting intothe best line in the movie that almost encapsulates the entire filmim not laughing at you im laughing with you but im not laughingi preferred to dollhouse perhaps because illuminated a side of the more wellbehaved supposed perfect ideal middleclass suburban lifestyle its sort of like a more pessimistic and repulsive hannah and her sisters it deals wit three sisters and their lives and the misery in which they have to deal with in their livesit satirically attacks that supposed ideal uppermiddle white class which seem successful and ideal and peel back the layer and reveal how closeted emotionally deformed and miserable they truly arespoilers here brace yourselfthe pedophile material about the father who molests his sons best friend at a sleepover is really going to get under peoples skin and make them gaspbill the father whos also a child psychiatrist for probably the nature of his obsession wonders about his own sons sexuality but his is really the dangerous one the fatherson material is solondz risqusatire as its absolute best its sad the movie bombed theatrically mostly because the pedophile material got the movie an nc17 so the movie was released with no rating at allsolondz is fascinated and obsessed with the darker and more quiet secrets that fester from behind those whitesuburban doors hes from jersey from that class of neighborhood that he lampoons so often and so wellhere is the one man from jersey who dares to make something of himself i know i know i know its such an easy target jersey hell even ny makes fun of jersey nobody gives it respectexcept kevin smith hes the only one who shows his town some love not many filmmakers come out of jersey now jersey can proudly claim solondz and smithclosing note this movie contains frank sexual talk coarse dialouge and rape taking place offscreen and some serious emotional abuse i really enjoyed it i strongly recommend it but you should all really know what youre getting intothe movie originally got an nc17 rating it has not been edited solondz simply released it with no rating at all you have all been warnedstill pursuing dane youssef,black_comedy
it seems that directorwriter todd solondz is saying that sex or more specifically cumming is whether or not you believe that is inconsequential all that matters is that you accept it for the film and look at the issues it raises possibly the most important part in this movie is the song written by joy expressing her need for you see we all need and if is sex than what about the pedophiles and perverts  all they need is too this movie not only fearlessly faces those issues but also creates them i never thought about pedophiles and other perverts in such a way before i still believe that most of what they do is wrong in every way shape and form but now i can see it from their point of view that is what this movie does it shows you these characters what they do what they want and all that but it does not judge them or tell the audience that these men are bad with harsh jarring music or an aphorism expressed by a surrounding character berating them for what they are i loved this movie 810,black_comedy
i just finished watching this movie and i thought it would be best to comment on it while it was fresh within my head i first saw todds work when i saw welcome to the dollhouse when i was really young so i liked that and therefore decided to go for wow this movie takes you places you know you want to go but would never venture truly unique is this movie and the fact that jon lovitz and phillip seymour hoffman are in the same feature even for a second make the movie outrageous this movie is a trip for one to go on and its kind of hard to explain the dialog is incredibly realistic and the problems are realistic but the kind of things people just dont talk about todd has this interesting view of the suburbs which i can truly appreciate having grown up in the suburbsthe last 30 minutes of the movie i wont give away but i will say this in a scene between a father and his son and everything after that watching that just had something snap for me something about the suburbs just looks different after seeing this and youll never think of peoples families the same way after watching that it was just sooo good and sooo interesting and yet so kinda sad and still funny that your like wow its like i didnt know i had the ability to mix emotions and nostalgia so well and weirdly until now definitely watch this movie and in the mighty words of fg thats all i have to say about that,black_comedy
after reading the reviews on herei thought id be blown awayi liked blue velvet betterhelli thought pink flamingoes was more shockingthan this guess i just didnt get it i guess i just expected a lot more from this film from the reviews ive read on here,black_comedy
oh my god that was my reaction at the end of this movie  i couldnt believe how disturbing and shocking this movie was  i thought i had seen some movies with disturbing content but i dont think ive ever seen anything this disturbing  some of the scenes were very uncomfortable to watch  i was by myself and i felt like fastforwarding through some scenes when im by myself ill see a lot of nudity sex and cursing in movies and i dont even notice it  but this movie doesnt even have much cursing and barely any nudity and it was very disturbing  i guess it was a combination of very good acting and taboo subjects  i found the conversations with the boy and his father the hardest to watch just because that doesnt seem like anything a father should say to his son  and there are several masterbation scenes which you dont really want to see  i know almost everyone masterbates but i dont care to see cum in motion pictures  oh god the last scene in the movie i was laughing and simultaneously disgusted you think stifler drinking the beer with it in it is bad and the famous scene from something about mary was bad but i think the last scene in this movie is worse ughhh i dont know if i can place a number to rate this movie the acting was good and i wanted to see how the movie ended but i dont know if i can recommmend a movie i can barely watch myself  it was interesting i suppose but some of the dialogue was brutally slow  there would be talking then long pauses between the characters  i would have liked to have seen more of a conclusion of what happened to the pedofile physchiatrist if he went to jail or if the kids father beat him up or killed him  i think philip seymour hoffman was the best in this movie  i think hes one of the best actors of our time and i hope he gets roles in many future movies  ok after reading this if you arent scared away then i recommend this movie  what the hell ill give it a rating 6510,black_comedy
oh man this movie is super if youre old enough to understand the quirky absurdist approach if you dont dig that skip the moviefor those who dont want to skip well the movie is again a revenge of the nerds a la solondz it all seems like one of three sisters joy is a loser even the most obnoxious of men take advantage of her she gets abused by everyone she tries to be nice to her successful sisters are shooting poisonous darts into her ohmygoshthirtyandunmarried heart and so on and so forth shes sad but shes still nice to everyone and she does learn one thing or two along the way sisters look plain evil until we get some hilariousdisturbing insight into the perversity of people that surround themthe actors are wonderful,black_comedy
all the roles in the movie had been regarded to be happy or say admired by others at least once while actually they all felt unhappy themselves that is the point we tend to be aware of what is annoying us however neglect what we already have which made us happyfrankly i like this movie better than magnolia for the story goes very natural every minute caught my eyes i laughed when the roles laughed while sometimes i still laughed when they were weeping it is absolutely an excellent dark comedy but it really made you think,black_comedy
im inclined to think that is a great american film animportant work with a great deal of depth wit and disturbingcontent  as uncomfortable as it made me feel at times i lovedevery minute of it  the acting is always great and seems to getmore unabashed and convincing with each passing scene solondz assembled an awesome cast and its remarkable to methat they were able to make this film what it was for such a lowbudget  its deranged its creepy its almost unbelievable but itstotally worth every minute of its running time,black_comedy
this is a film that lives up to black comedy it is on my top 5 all time film list and solondz filmmaking is some of the best ive seen some people might judge this film as being everything but funny but i find it hilarious solondz originality in concept brave direction and fascinating character development makes a film to respect if i ever had the privilege to meet todd solondz i would shake his hand for having the courage to cross a line other directors never had enough balls to cross,black_comedy
this is the very definition of a dark comedy dark comedies have only a limited audience and so youll do yourself a huge favour by not bringing people who you know are going to hate this movie youll enjoy the movie more if youre not continously worrying about whether someone you brought is going to walk out of this movie in disgust i think the reason this movie achieves its success is because the characters are so normal on the outside but yet they live disturbingly different lives in secret  instead of saying you can cut through the tension with a butter knife you can say you can cut through the normalcy with a butter knifethis is the second time ive seen and i normally try to avoid seeing a movie more than once but there were a few years in between the viewings and the movie seemed fresh once again,black_comedy
i think a film like is inaccurately categorized as a dark comedy actually it is darkly comic but mainly it is drama in cruel irony a journey into personal agonies some pathetic some monstrous it is skillfully written very gutsy and very well acted not once during this film was i entertained rather i was captivated and engaged and i was thinking about it for days afterward which is what a good art film should at least doi think the people who slam this film just dont get it and i cant say that i blame them it definitely is a hard film to watch as that it deals with the darkest of subject matter and admittedly sometimes seems to toe exploitation but there is substance to all the actions and characters and meanings are there in the text of the film albeit subtle all the characters are in pursuit of but each has different definitions some are just seeking pleasure some are just desperate to to be lonely and one is desperate to be alone all their stories intertwine to a cohesive yet not quite happy statement at the end it is ultimately a film about sadness in many ways one storyline the shocking one is really a horror storythis is an excellent film but almost impossible to recommend to the general public taste but the brave and those willing to accept a challenge will appreciate it  910,black_comedy
i might be one of the minority but i think a movie about sadness is great too often do movies end happily and predictably but this movie does neither the movie mixes perverse and horrible situations with some comedy and is a great movie,black_comedy
this was some pretty hard hitting stuff todd solondz should applauded for trying to present such issues in this way to cinema todd solondz is not glorifying the evil that curses the characters in i got the feeling especially for dylan bakers bill maplewood character the feeling he would be caught and he would get the inevitable and quite frankly deserved the entire cast are pretty damn good from philip seymour hoffmans lonely and tortured soul allen to jane adams joy jordan infact the whole thing reminded me of the way paul thomas anderson makes his films which is a great thing i see many simularities between solondz and anderson but solondz insists on a far more troubled character so he will find it harder to make films in the future810,black_comedy
i loved and own todd solondzs previous movie welcome to the dollhouse and after having read many glowing reviews decided to give a tryoh brother  what a waste all the way aroundthis movie reportedly is a very dark comedy but i did not even smile one time not onceevery character was hopelessly uninteresting and onedimensional who caresthe following could be considered spoilers although there is not much to spoili am not easily shocked or conservative but much of the movie seemed to be there only so that those responsible could say look our movie talks about or shows this or that  in this case we get semen shooting on to a wall in one scene then later semen shooting onto a balcony railing to be licked off by a dog wonderfulmaybe the humor was in the sexed qa between the 11year old son and father where words of wisdom included the fact that its not the length that is important but the width so says the dad and that come can be a verb as well as a noun insightfuli cant find a way to get any humor out of anally raping young boys  and im afraid couldnt find it either  unless it was the fathers line to his 11year old son that he would only jerk off instead of raping him wittyok ok i did find the one bit of humor it was at the restaurant when camryn mannheims character orders a hot fudge sundae after talking about murdering the doorman who helped carry her groceries to her apartment and asked for some ice before raping herbut seriously it could have gotten an oscar for best special effect  creating an animatronic character looking exactly like lara flynn boyle sorry lara at least in twin peaks we knew you were dead look carefully at the dvd back cover see lara flat and unmoving that represents her action sequencethe rest of the characters look at the front cover all of them are frowning and looking pretty grim  just like me after watching this movie,black_comedy
one can compare a number of grossout cuttingedge films to to discover why this movie really hits home  take south park bigger longer uncut pink flamingoes return of the living dead  each of those three has a humorous subtext that runs like a weak undertow in the swill never completely pulling you under but always there as a reminder despite its funny scenes lacks this anklelevel current and hits you topside with wave after wave of despondency and bleakness  yes this is a great film especially for the fine actingbut why make this film  is new jersey really so bad  well should we ask kevin smith,black_comedy
a powerful display in shaping characters they are as believable as they are painful to watch the storyline is strong and takes the audience behind the doors and into the homes of people with secrets and demons in their back pockets the director creates situations which makes us laugh only to feel terrible the next moment as we realize how tragic the situation is well im going to cut it short by saying watch it and enjoy,black_comedy
is the story of a group of sisters their families and the people whose lives are intertwined between the 3 sisters this is as dark as black comedydark humor gets and its pretty disturbingpersonally this is a must see but ive shown it to friends and theyve said to me that i was sick for watching it one of the male charachters is a shrink who secretly harbors desires for young male boys and another brilliantly played by the always amazing phillip seymour hoffman is an obscene phone caller who when he meets the vixen of his depraved desires played excellently by lara flynn boyle he cant live up to it as shes too beautiful and shes not attrachted to him everyone in this movie is so great and its not been seen by everyone as it got an nc17 rating but this is a mustsee of any fan of black humor films out of ,black_comedy
this is brave filmmaking at its best todd solondz has taken the darkest subject matter available and turned out a masterpiece worthy of standing out opposite such greats as magnolia and american beauty  the acting is superb throughout with philip seymourhoffman and dylan baker turning out starperformances i hope to see more films of this calibre and look forward to seeing mr solondz future projects,black_comedy
what kind of sick perverted person makes movies about misery and its lower depths for us to chuckle at who else but todd solondz and his very wicked sense of humor through the lives of ordinary people there is a time bomb ticking in each of them ready to explode each one with a problem as big as the next person they all seem to cross paths like in an altman movie but this time around theyre not big name stars but actors who amazingly fit the mould of the characters they portray each one a convincing performance my admiration goes to those who had faith in financing this project and specially to those who made it brave filmmaking in an era where mass production movie fluff is the only grocery item found on the shelves,black_comedy
ask philip seymour hoffman he will tell you the same thing that magnolia was just a ripoff also watch welcome to the dollhouse and especially the brilliant storytelling you will adore todd solondz work hes the most exciting new director in the states along with sam mendes but hes british not surprisingly,black_comedy
it was once said that tragedy plus time equals comedy  the genius in is that the tragedy needed no time to be hilarious  right from the start of the movie you are in a position where you can do nothing but laugh  you are thrown into disturbing twisted situations in a way that no film has done before  this film is not for the squeamish moral or conventional  solondz is the darkest of any director ive encountered and his films serve as an important outlet for anyone who didnt have a cakewalk upbringing or things handed to them  this film is for people who have experienced the darker parts of life had things taken from them and had to earn what they have  but that isnt enough you also have to appreciate that everything can be comedy  beware of people who sit through this movie and seem appalled and put off they likely take themselves far too seriously and are dominated by their environment  kinda like oscars comedy discrimination i rarely give comedies perfect 10s  this is an important exception 1010,black_comedy
i turned into this film by accident on the independent film channel at about one in the morning after watching this i couldnt get to sleep this film was going every which way from sunday and every way it went left me shaking my head as to why i wanted to know and where was all of this headedit was easy for me to understand that the family this film centered on was as nutty as they come excuse the pun i could also understand that each of the sisters led a very different lifestyle but none of their lives were perfect but why rub in the deep down dredge of it even the parents of these daughters were completely messed up and the ending was just unnecessarythe only part i liked was the first 15 minutes with jon lovitz i had high hopes for the film after that opening and then it went down hill down the drain and down the gutter from there the subject matter of the film was not what turned me off the cast has actors that i loved dylan baker phillip seymour hoffman laura flynn boyle camryn manheim louise lassier ben gazzara elizabeth ashley but their characters were played for shock value only not dramatic i felt each and everyone of their characters could have been developed more with their problems and the script could have been so much better for such an adult film with taboo adult themes and the ending was just unnecessaryshame on the producer director and writer of this film for letting this film go the manner of which it did it could have been great,black_comedy
i took me by surpriseand the ending was great if you like american beauty magnolia you will like this one the actors were also great except lara flynn boyle who i think is overrated so go and see it,black_comedy
this movie has multiple stories going on at the same time  from the guy who has serious problems with his people skills and assorted sexual issues to the father who lusts after his 11yearold sons friends this movie is sure to shock and disturb you  yet this is a comedy making you laugh despite your feelings of guilt and shock  yes this movie made me laugh really hard but i also wanted to take a shower afterwards  this movie started slowly quickly began exploring a variety of relationship issues and ended with a bang you would not expect  all in all i would recommend this movie to people who are not too prudish or easily disgusted,black_comedy
todd solondz and david lynch have one thing in common theyre both often called perverts lynch for his film blue velvet and solondz for his fantastically original film  the film takes your typicaland not so typical losers perverts and ordinary people and rotates them around so at one point we may be touched at the characters plight and at the next we laugh as the movie pokes vicious biting fun at them this is quite similar to what lynch did in blue velvet in fact is almost like the twisted second cousin of blue velvet solondz places many homages to lynchs filmthe hallways in an apartment complex seem to have an electric hum the basic theme of perversions under suburbia but solondz goes more in the direction of satire directed at people who could be your nextdoor neighborthe film is like a more perverted version of magnolia it takes a group of several people and follows their lives but while magnolia dealt with ordinary people with big problems deals with people who  may be and are problems to society to give examples one character is a pedophile and in the course of the film does rape some childrenoffscreenanother is a fat loser played brilliantly by phillip seymour hoffman who makes obscene phone calls and then masturbates an elevenyear old obsessed with masturbation himself leading to one of the best final lines of any movie ever and of course the perpetually euphoric woman named joy whos life is a hopeless mess solondz though turns the tables on these possibly unpleasant people he takes them makes us feel sympathy for them than brutally makes fun of them some hated the film for this how can you make fun of people while at the same time try to identify with them but solondz manages just that he seems to be see them one way rotates the microscope and then sees them in a totally different light this contrast actually helps us to identify with the characters more because we see them in so many different lights we know more about them and can therefore feel for them through the course of the film we get involved in everyones plight several of which are howlingly funnyphillip seymour hoffmans character has an obsession with the woman next doorlara flynn boyle he fantasizes of having sex with her and even raping her but he knows because he is so meek it could never come true one night when he phoning  up people to give them obscene messages he phones the neighbor she is turned on by his sexual ravings she wants more using autoredialive had you on autoredial all night she begins to phone him so many times he unplugs the phone she finds out his work phonenumber leading to one of the best lines in the moviehoffmanwhat do you wantboyle i want you to f mehoffman nearly crying i dont think i can do thatsolondz has just taken a characters perversions turned them on him and made vicious fun of a potentially sick situation this repeats itself all through the movie contrating with several  emotionally powerful moments as when the father confesses his rape of one of his sons friends to a boy he answers all the boys questions no matter how tough they get i find it truly amazing that solondz manages to find a balance and make this an uplifting sort of movie instead of turning it into something unpleasanta truly remarkable accomplishmentthis film is not for everyone it went out unrated because the mpaa rated it nc17 and that can mean bad business for any film but for people who are openminded and willing to see a movie that is really something to admire instead of the usual hollywood crap i highly recommend it1010,black_comedy
this is one of the very few movies ive seen who combines the most shocking and sad drama with comedy without it becoming a bad taste moviethe charactres are really sad people and sometimes hilarious the comedy part but still it shocks cause of the chosen sexual themes pedofilia masturbation sex addiction etc the way its filmed and the script gives a very human touch to even the most criminal charactres definately a movie that makes you think and good for a discussion after,black_comedy
probably one of the darkest and most disturbing movies ive ever seen but i still come back to it now and again and rewatch it on dvd certainly one for mature audiences the shockvalue is pretty incredible but it makes the whole thing seem brutally honest yet through all this theres a great deal of humor too  you cant help but laugh  and its more a oh my god did he really just say that kind of laughter which is refreshing sometimes its rare for movies these days to disturb and enchant in equal measures but with its great characters and their complex problems superb musical score and hardhitting approach to some of lifes darker issues does it very well how something this bleak can be so entertaining is a mystery  that could be why the movie is so great how it manages to achieve both rave reviews and feelings of utter contempt from some viewers is to me just another sign of its brilliance in a world where sometimes it seems that blandness is a virtue im glad that theres movies like to provoke a response in people,black_comedy
i really enjoyed  the writing and direction fromsolondz were wonderful and the cast was terrific especially dylanbaker and hoffman  i bet a lot of people are left aghast afterwatching this movie due to the subject matter but i thought it wasjust wonderful  to get and enjoy the movie you really have to beintelligent enough to realize that many of the scenes andcharacters in the movie are caricatures of common types of peopleand situations in real life just twisted or exaggerated for comediceffect  i recently had an experience similar to jon lovitzscharacters experience at the beginning of the movie with a flakyshallow girl and i told her off the same way he did when we brokeup just not quite to the extent that lovitz did and for the rest ofyour life you  not me  will always be s  i cant wait to seewhat baker does next  he was in and requiem for adream two of the grittiest movies ive seen and he was excellentin road to perdition  ive never forgotten his owen character inplanes trains and automobiles either  i hope he stars inanother quality movie soon  this guy is great  i wish solondzmade movies more often more than one every 3 or 4 years  illreally looking forward to more from him,black_comedy
okay i will have to sit the fence on this one because i thought the characters were great the acting on the money and the script solid but did solondz have to give us every graphic detail and keep this film from getting an mpaa rating to prove he could get away with itspoilersnow i have not read all the reviews here but i know there are great raves as well as pure disgust at this film  i really did like it and though most of it was a real hoot  save for the pedophelia which is obviously very messed up did the producers and the writer director think that we would not get that someone ejaculated if we did not see it  in other words did the viewer have to see semen to know it happened and did it add any more to the story  while many people might call this film genius and im sure scenes like the aforementioned added to the fact they didnt let this get an mpaa rating i really dont feel it added to the anything other than the graphic nature that makes people go ewww  if that is the route why not cover everyone who feels like sht with feces  why not let us see the sputum dripping off the actresses face after being spat on  john waters may havedid the conversation between the pedophile and his kid add up to contribute to the story or was it allowed because it was known how disturbing it might be  would it not have been just as shocking without having all the gory details thrust before usis a bludgeoning murder any less murder or disturbing just because you do not see the blood splattered on the wall or witness a crushed deformed skull  that is the real question that might be asked here  while vachon christinethe producer has made her mark going that extra mile to do films other producers might not touch ultimately that which took away a rating here could invariably be left out to produce as much a shocking portrait of dissonance as it did being left in  seeing the semen on the wall just took away from the wider market this work might have garnered had it not been left there to post cards upon  not even the local blockbuster will carry this and thats a shame for getting ones message out for sure if those making the film didnt want nor care to release it broadly as possible what is the point in this day and agejust to say they could still id say it is a great film but not as great as it might have been with just a bit more tweaking  that tweak kept this off the academy lists for certain  you really showed em there regardless of whether its political or not  they surely liked the feeling boys dont cry gave them when it made it,black_comedy
based on r2 dvd 134 minthe casting and acting is pretty much flawless which in itself would rate this a worth watching movie however is the the unusual approach to the subject matter that makes this movie very different from the normyour unlikely to see many movies of this calibre any calibredealing with such a outcast subject played out through the lives of more or less ordinary people while this is probably for the best it does propel this movie in to the minor masterpiece rangeviewer discretion is strongly advised with good reason many adults will find this movie upsetting810 minor masterpiece,black_comedy
i watched last night and i had to stop it several times but i did see it all i was really looking forward to this film and see myself as very open to all forms of artistic expression in my eyes this film is a nasty piece of trash i cannot believe the reviews that praise this film as a masterpiece and as honest what results if someone is sexually repressed so anyone who isnt having sex is deranged now all disfunctional familiesalmost all of us come from oneact like psychos behind closed doors even if this is not the films intention it still cant be redeemed in my eyes i hope the child actor in the film isnt disturbed later on because the material he had was inappropriate and to me bordered on abuse how many of us asked our parents about cumming  and how we can acheive that goal did you run to the dinner table to inform your mother and the rest of the family that you came for the first time pedophiles are not interesting people i dont want to know the inner workings of their mind and have no sympathy for them because they realize that they are sick i dont appreciate women who only wish they had been raped as a child so they can publish their novels more honestly if this is the future of cinema i will get a new hobby the message is out  the sicker the crap the more your work will be embraced,black_comedy
todd solondz follows up his brillaint welcome to the dollhouse with another great film in the form of the dialouge delivered in the film is unique and somewhat racy but thats what makes the film intiurging dylan baker plays one of the sickest charcter to emegre on the screen and phlip baker hall delivers some funny lines as a sexually frustaed man not for all tastes but still a good movie,black_comedy
this is without a doubt one of the most controversial films of recent times and with a very delicate subject matter its a hard task to get right and this is a modern masterpiece how a film can be very disturbing and very funny at the same time i do not know but this never fails to impress this is a subversively funny film it has everything required to make a great indie flick each character gets their chance to shine individually and in turn you cannot single any actor out for their part philip seymour hoffman must be one of the most reliable actors in america today and his part is awesome as too is dylan baker whom i can only remember being the redneck son of a hotel clerk in planes trains and automobiles who gives steve martin and john candy a ride watch out for the show stealing final scene from the young boy its sickeningly funny this film really does deserve the critical acclaim it received see it now 1010,black_comedy
wilhelm reich onetime disciple of freud and a revolutionary psychological theorist of some note argued that the transcendental pleasure of the orgasm was the epitome of life energy he called it orgone energy and at the heart of all human desire reich also argued that the repression of orgasmic sexuality was the cornerstone of all social psychological and political repression and oppression could have been written by wilhelm reich himself it argues the same thesisthat human beings most want transcendence through sexual gratification and are most often derived of it the irony is that it is precisely the guilty repression of the sex drive that leads to all manner of neurosis and perversion distilled to its essence argues that society only appears to be comprised of a complex sexual pecking order based on looks age status etc in reality even the most conventionally desirable have very problematic sex lives because desire is more primal that convention it circulates freely and unpredictably and often confounds the logic of commodification though a wrenching viewing experience is a that rarity a film of ideas it is also a brilliantly articulated plea for a reassessment of the power of the sexual urge and the basic human need for moments of transcendence in a society devoted to stupefaction escapism and infantile dreams of omnipotence,black_comedy
one of the darkest funniest most brilliant films ive seen  whenever viewers become so engrossed in a film that they use laughter as a defense mechanism you know youve got some quality disturbing material  worth a viewing or two but not for the squemish or easily upset,black_comedy
gush wonderfully disobedient gush seditiously comic gush seriously satiric gush cynthia stevenson gives the best comedic performance since mm in some like it hot gush i havent seen so much talent in one movie since the great escape gush    and the perfectly idiotic title song  ,black_comedy
is probably one of the most ironic movie titles ever i dont think anyone in this film is happy or even close to happy todd solondzs film is reminiscent of altmans short cuts because solondz uses the same technique of storytelling connecting people with each other using everything from phone calls to kinship to further deepen the irony of the title the film is full of colourful sets and clothes and the cinematography is very bright the sister who seems to be the happiest and most successful lara flynn boyle is also the one who apparently hates herself i am nothing the acting is superb dylan baker is brilliant as the paedophile the film is also brilliant as good as solondzs last film welcome to the dollhouse,black_comedy
this movie is very disturbing at parts but frequently funny in its small insights into human behavior and motivations todd solondz seems to have an inexhaustible fascination with the random pain an loneliness inflicted on every on of us and i dont mind that he doesnt let the viewer off the hook with feelgood endings where the innocents are comforted and the victimizers get their just desserts it makes his films singular although not necessarily comfortable to sit through i come away from his moviesespecially welcome to the dollhouse thinking about the true consequences of the hurt peopleand by extension i perpetrate on other people you cant help but thinking that these semicomical tragedies and victimizations are happening as we speak and that speaks to the power of solondz vision he does not as ive seen critics suggest just throw a pile of anguish and pain on the screen just for its own sake or to shocki think theres a moral lurking about but its one that the viewer has to discern,black_comedy
whether you love or hate this movie it will have a powerful effect on you i think the most interesting thing about it is that it makes you laugh at things against your better judgement and some viewers may feel weird about that it was similar in that way to spankingthemonkey in that it makes you feel bad about laughing at whats going on i can only recommend this one to the most adventurous viewers if you have ever disliked a movie because it went too far dont watch,black_comedy
ok it didnt really change my life but i have never been so roughed up by a movie in my life every other scene made my jaw drop half the fun was listening to the audience squirm somewhere between laughter and horror camryn manheim is brilliant  the scene where she confesses her  crime is unforgettable as is most of this movie i never knew what to expect i had no idea where the film was going and i loved it where most films serve up familiar scenes in familiar packages this one engages you dares you to watch sucks you in  for days afterward i couldnt stop thinking about the movie the very first scene is probably the best work john lovitz has ever done this movie looks dead on at some of the most awkward and horrific things in american culture but never ever ever tells you or suggests to you what you should think or feel the way most films do see it w someone you know and at least like bec youre going to have to talk about it afterward the best movie of 1998,black_comedy
the real experience provided by the film about life consists in discover all that is front of us it doesnt matter if is right or wrong sane or insane etc what really matters is that all of them are perfectly human on this way we are walking every day and probably in one moment you will find something that makes you happy but in other youre the creator of the our begins with ourselves such as the sadness this last one has too many different ways to ask help but its common cant hear it the events such as the environment to develop this film were perfect an excellent masterpiece,black_comedy
i saw this film about two weeks ago on the annual film festival in stockholm and its no doubt in my mind that this is the film of the year so farand now its novemberi cant say that i was especially surprised and choked over the the controversial contents cause i knew what to expect after seeing solondz wellcom to the dollhouse and reading about i had prepared myself for a dark insight in american suburbia and this is what amazed me of course a movie dealing with eg pedophilia and murder in an realistic way with a close and personal perspectivenot the hollywood chase and kill scenariois dark and sometimes quite painful to watch but solondz manages to form his caracters with some humanity and show the other side of the coin this combined with many comic situations which are not provoked but come naturally makes this film somewhat easier tho watch then wellcom to the dollhouse and in fact quite more genius,black_comedy
what a wonderfully twisted dark and complex film  most people will likely be put off the film because of some of the subject matter  a shame because in doing so they fail to realize a daring and disturbing plot excellent acting and genuinely fine direction  exactly how does a director make a pedophile into a sympathetic character  not very easily especially since most people prefer to see such people as onedimensional monsters  by adding depth to such a heinous character showing that people are more than their actions however disgusting solondz shakes the very fabric of our happy society exposing an underbelly that is not onedimensional but one which is frighteningly like our own  it is only when our demons are fleshed out made realistic that we become uncomfortable with them when they no longer maintain their safe cartoonishthrillride quality  this film takes such huge risks i can only hope that audiences who have been spoonfed such trite rubbish as armageddon and the phantom menace can appreciate its dark genius  pacing becomes problematic at times especially when the story follows the sisters parents  some of the imagery is quite disturbing and the moovie will definitely not appeal to everyone  and contrary to other reviews this film does not promote pedophilia any more than sex education promotes teen sex  this film challenges its audience in ways very few films can  for those who believe that this moovie somehow represents the depths to which hollywood has sunk the moocow is here to say that this film is very antihollywood  thoughtprovoking and gutwrenching moocow says check this out this film but for mature open minds only please 8,black_comedy
this movie is one of my favorite movies this movie deals with taboo subjects but in a very humorous way when i explain this movie to my friends they look at me like im sick i felt the same way after i found out what it was about but after i watched it all i could do was laugh so what if this movie is in bad taste its funnythe last sequence between the son and the dad is some of the funniest and most memorable dialogue i have ever heard,black_comedy
this movie the best of 98 is incredibly funny disturbing and brilliant by disturbing you by going places no other films have gone and making you laugh the film finds its power by forcing you into that middle ground by making you questions yourself  why am i laughing at this this is horrible  thats what a film is supposed to do isnt it challenge you make you question yourself  does that more than any other movie ive seen,black_comedy
this is another one of those pulp fiction type of movies where there are no good characters  its like the tv talk shows where you can feel good about yourself because youre not nearly as messed up as the characters in this plot  because the characters are so screwed up it  provides comedy if youre not already too offended  there is one character that is disturbingly unforgivable  thats about all i can say without giving away too much of the plot,black_comedy
as emotionally shattering as saving private ryan was as mesmerizing as malicks thin red line was no movie of 1998 hit me as hard as todd solondz brilliant awful hilarious disturbing you will not be the same after you watch this film and isnt that what the great ones are supposed to do,black_comedy
i found curiously  funny as always by presenting a serious topic in this case child molestation in a darkly humorous light writerdirector todd solondz makes you laugh wince and wonder why on earth this stuff is so darn funny at many points during the film i found myself wondering if i was sick for finding this film a riot  in other words if you take life too seriously dont see this film but if you just want to see some dark humor great acting especially by the young rufus read as 11year old billy who thinks hes a loser and have an open mind make a point of renting it  the store clerk may smile and give you a weird look but its worth it,black_comedy
welcome to the dollhouse director todd solondz tackles taboo subjects like adultery homosexuality masturbation pedophilia suicide and sexual rejection in a way that makes the movie fun for the whole family  a sick yet funny movie gets an 8,black_comedy
has todd solondz finally reached that fine line between bad bad taste and good bad taste with he proves he can definitely pull off good bad taste this is a truly awful movie that will leave the viewer either scarred for life or will keep them coming back for more i am the second kind of viewer had me laughing out loud to myself with its twisted dialogue and cringing in disgust at many lewd and vulgar scenes the movie holds humor throughout every offense and stomach churning frame a great piece of work mr solondz please give us more,black_comedy
i missed the theater show of this movie big mistake i just rented it and one of the best unique and most realistic movie for a long a time a totally whole family entertainment piece of work great material and a sense of originality that lately you dont find in the current lame films of the 90s cant wait to see it again and truly watch the raw and sincere aspect of real life you must be very ignorant or unhappy to miss this flick narrow minded people you are missing the treat of your life,black_comedy
this is an unusual and thought provoking film it takes as its subject matter the underbelly of family life the tension selfdeceit and anguish we all experience in different ways but presents them in a cool almost detached way which is unsettling and challenging the setting is middleamerica which has never seemed less appealing and a group of characters who do not elicit sympathy and include one whose behaviour in cinema is generally portrayed as monstrous his behaviour is monstrous but all the more believable because it is presented in such an understated way such people do not appear monstrous in their everyday lives the distance employed by the director forces us to form moral judgements he does not tell us how we should react but allows space which made very me conscious of my role as observer it is also very funny at times but here too there is uncertainty should i really be laughing at this this is a difficult film to judge but to me it rang true behind every family there are dark truths we would rather others did not see a fascinating film from an interesting director well served by a superb cast,black_comedy
as the countless reviews before this one will tell you is not a disney film and despite its title theres very little on display in the world which the film shows us it is by turns both funny and gutwrenchingly sad both watchable and cringeworthy but never less than brutally honestthis is very much a character piece the plot at times resembling the intermingling of robert altmans films as we follow some difficult times in the lives of around a dozen characters who are all connected to varying degreesall of the characters have problems covering the whole range of human emotions from arrogance to smugness loneliness to murderous and from sexually frustrated to paedophilia at times your jaw will drop that such subjects are being broached in a film which is hilarious in many parts but this discomfort is surely part of solondz strategy where other films leave us at the threshold takes us behind closed doors to look at the lives of people who could well be your neighboursthe acting throughout is first class especially dylan baker as the childabusing shrink and phillip seymour hoffman as the lonely sexually frustrated office worker praise must also go to jane adams playing the social reject of three dysfunctional sistersif i had any criticisms its that the characters in the film all seem to express their inadequacies sexually and the confession of hoffmans neighbour seems a little too farfetched in an otherwise convincing script but these do not overly detract from the films good qualitiesthere is little more i can say about this movie except to encourage you not to let the subject matter put you off its a dark vision of modern life that we see in a million miles away from the sinister suburbia of david lynch because in it could very well be happening right next door,black_comedy
i am very open minded and love all kinds of films  i especially like the weird ones  that said this fillm made me literally cringe  it gave me anxiety attacks  it made the seratonin in my system run rampant  this film transcended badit went beyond dysfunctional  it wasnt even all that sick  gratuitious doesnt even touch it the lovitz scene at the start was good but the rest hmmmm i dont even know how to begin here  anyway i do respect the opinions of all of you so for those of you who found value in this i applaud you with a very bewildered look on my mug,black_comedy
it is very hard to explain to other people what it is about i can only say that this a very unusual moving brilliantly acted confronting cynical and captivating film every movie lover should see i will guarantee you will not see something of this kind or this brilliance anymore this yearif you love moviesgo and see it,black_comedy
i really like this movie  i bought it  this is one of those movies where you must decide between laughing and crying  this is a challenging viewing with a straightlaced eye the idiosyncrasies of suburban life  the judgements and the dialect all seem to fit into place  if you think that you can handle watching something that will challenge your lifestyle make you look at it and wonder why see this movieacting  wonderful  i loved jon lovitz and i loved the pedophile  i dont know but they really rang true to me  they always say he was a nice enough guy  joy was different but she played her character well everybody else did wonderful as well but these characters and the acting really stuck out in my mind  also the little boy seemed truly curious in a boyish way but not really mature enough to handle it which i can relate to  he did not even seem to grasp what he was spewing out of his mouththe movie challenging  i dare you to watch this movie  it challenges you and it will make you think  no real story other than all of the characters would like to achieve  it challenges suburban life and it challenges inner city life  it will make you think twice before your next decision whether it be little or smallpeople who say that this movie is ironic and that it is sometimes funny and uncomfortable i say that that is what it is supposed to be  life is uncomfortable  to those who didnt know if they should be laughing or crying i say laugh because my family has a saying if i didnt laugh i would be crying10,black_comedy
takes a hard look at why people are so unhappy in our modern world and comes up with some depressing but true answers  it returns over and over to the theme that people just dont do a good job of connecting with each other  they dont listen and they dont love  the other major theme is the sickness that can be found in the suburbs  there under the guise of normality the most profound sicknesses can be foundthe film does not cut any corners  it looks into violence sexual fetishes and pedophilia like few other films  it proves that film can still shock and have a purpose which is nice in this age of been there done that  quite often people find themselves unhappy because they have redirected their sexual energies into unhealthy objects such as children of course even the obese woman finds herself in a unique and awful situation by always making even the most benign character have a bizarre personality flaw solondz keeps the viewer offbalance and confusedthe film is quite funny but also touching  you can really feel for some of the misfit characters even the father who does such a horrible thing  we learn that actions are not as individual as we would like and we learn that people have limitations  overall i felt that the film has a rare humanity that is usually lost in modern hollywood product  perhaps if we would all just be a bit more honest with each other talk about who we are and why then we would all find the movies title  since the films characters cannot do that at least with each other they remain unhappy  of course when they fulfill their needs they are often punished  we are given clues to why we all are so odd during the film and i hope viewers take note,black_comedy
my feelings on leaving this movie were the opposite of  it was rarely funny and often depressing the st margarets film club of which i am president gave this a definite thumbs down,black_comedy

spoilers for about 5 minutes i loved if judged only on jon lovits opening scene this would be an amazing film the opening words are shocking brutal and totally truthful things the film loses very quickly instead of going for an emotional structure the film delves into the same sick overblown gross spewing of bodily fluids that occupies many comedies these days in those films they are played for laughs here they serve no purpose other than to shock to make the audience feel like theyre watching something insightful and interesting during the manipulative moments of suspense like when a suburban pederast hovers over a young boy with a sick depravity in his eyes we should feel terrified instead i felt very cheated all that this film has done is taken an ordinary human drama and inserted numerous shots of ejaculation that make no effort to spare the audience any sense of taste in teen comedies this is disgusting here it is considered art i had just about had it in with film a good part through but i stuck it out until the end after all of the ignorance this film shows to humanity we see the aftermath of a suburban father raping a small boy after everything else we arent subjected to a rape scene thank god but for all that apparently went on there is no soul left in the film after all that one of the final shots is of another boy ejaculating off a hotel balcony i do not want to see that in any film but this one has the nerve to end itself with micheal stipe singing where are you i havent got a clue with the kind of chipper country folk styling that always makes me cringe with this the film fools you into thinking that it was actually about the way people find making you forget all the sick scenes that came before well i wasnt fooled folks and you shouldnt be either,black_comedy
this movie was both horrifying and hilarious not intentional  the movie visited the fringe of society and tried to present itself as mainstream it creates a sense of complete unreality in regards to both the situations involved and the emotional content of the characters  not unlike kids the movie in parts borders on child pornography without regard to the stunned and disgusted audience  the main flaw of the film is that it lacks a message  it seems to present situations for the lone purpose of shock and tries to pass itself off as art  good art always has a point  those who reviewed and recommended the movie miss a point that many reviewers tend to do  just because its disturbing and sick doesnt make it a good movie,black_comedy
is often outrageously funny and it is occasionally moving but mostly it is just outrageous  well written beautifully filmed and well acted as it is whats not to like  ill tell you  every instance of warmth in the film is shattered by a shocking revelation of depravity  its characters are uniformly funny and interesting but their selfabsorption and unbelievable level of kinkiness detracted from my enjoyment of the film there was a mood of coolness and cynicism about that made me like it less than have most imdb voters  nevertheless despite my reservations i recommend it  7 out of 10,black_comedy
so okaythis is a story about three sister well kinda its more about one sister a sisters pedophile husband and a sisters screwy neighborsit has really shocking parts and i say hey bravo i admire its risks but thats not enough glue to put this incoherent film together,black_comedy
this film is absolutely brilliant it is absolutely amazing it is incredibly disturbing and actually makes you think about the people living next door could your neighbor be a pedophile or a phonesex pervert i think it was kind of sickening for some people to be entertained by this dark film,black_comedy
todd solondzs disturbing tale of vulgarity in suburban america at first look its any other indie film but quickly becomes one of the darkest films ive ever seen but solondz is clever and understands that this is what makes special this true exibitionist is afraid of the subject matter this is the freedom that indie directors have over the big names and solondz uses this to his advantage to paint an ugly portrait of sexual harassment paedaphilia and alienation this film gets a 9 for having the balls to say what other directorswriters never would best thing from new jersey since clerks,black_comedy
todd solonz aggressively pushes the envelope of transgressive material in this bleak comedy about entwining relationships centered around a dysfunctional family rooted in new jersey the topics are child molestation masturbation rape fantasies and mutilation and solonz chomps on them voraciously so much so that he loses control occasionally and seems like a pit bull on the attack its hard to tell whether he has much use for the whole perverted lot but he does let his actors shine most notably phillip seymour hoffman jane adams cynthia stevenson and a very very brave dylan baker the ensemble cast brings a certain amount of sympathy with them even when solonz is subverting them with cruel calculated dialogue the problem is that there may not be much more to the material worth noting than its inherent shock value youre disturbed while youre watching but when its over you feel more like youve been entertained the manipulation leaves you feeling sullied and a little ashamed if this is the point the director intended to make it may not be worth it,black_comedy
films are made to entertain this one does not  in fact it could have been made far better using voyeurism david lynch does it well in blue velvet was this film made because it now can be is it shock for the sake of shock after seeing this and doll house i am convinced this director has or had in his youth a peeping tom view of the world we know exists but for some reason he enjoys it wide screen large and in our face i believe he was turned on making and also hopes to titillate a select audience  an audience who enjoys seeing others transgress or emotionally tortured i believed the director enjoyed it when the loving wife found out about her sick husband and their worlds crumbled and also when the lonely teacher character after being used emerges in a warped way as the winning loser is the point being that those that appear as winners are rarely while those that appear as losers are through their inner strength comfort and acceptance of their station after all winners i guess,black_comedy
i wont belabor the plot everyone knows all about by now but i will quickly relate what this middleaged american male thought about this movie mr solendz should not be condemned for addressing the deeply disturbing subjects he does in this movie if the subject matter troubles you dont go doesnt pretend to be disney or meg ryan fare and boy it sure isnt if the subject is not a showstopper will treat you to some of the best ensemble acting found in a movie in 1998  is a series of small interrelated stories and the acting is superb there is no leading role carrying the film it is a group effort and it is topnotch but still has some problems the plot an emotionally heavy affair seems overburdened with too many dysfunctions  had solendz cut back on the number of subplots and delved into the remaining ones a little deeper i believe it would have improved the film with so many depravities crammed into the lives of the three sisters they become unbelievable while watching the movie one thinkswhat nextand by golly something even worse happens my only other criticism is the gratuitous shock scenes that seem inserted just to gross out the audience  instead of heightening it they distract from the emotional impact of the dramaremember this is not a farrely brothers movie  its still leading edge and very well done but im afraid mr solendz passed by his opportunity for a landmark movie,black_comedy
i usually have trouble handling this type of subjectmatter especially the pedophilia but this movie was so over the top that it was almost divorced from reality thats not to say these things dont exist they do they do i was very grateful that the film maker didnt show certain scenes but just the suggestion of those scenes was rather disturbing i liked this movie very much but probably will not see it again very interesting portrayal of people who are totally ungroundedthat is cut off from a higher sense of purpose and meaning superficial people leading superficial lives several of the characters had  glimpses of insight into their situation but clammed right back up as the older father says after having sex with a female friend i feel nothing great line,black_comedy
freud would have loved this movie what makes this movie so special however compared with other movies about lust is that it shows the outcasts of society  and by following a few totally different types it shows at the same time the commonality between people when it comes to sexual desire this movie doesnt seem to have any pretensions to convince you of an opinion like pedophiles are humans too or something on the contrary it shows people from their worst side and still it succeeds in making you feel sympathy for each of the main characters or at least just pity i think that is an incredible achievement a unique and brave piece of art,black_comedy
a deeply disturbing film which has left a mass of conflicting and uneasy reactions within me i am still trying to decide exactly how i feel about this film but at the moment i sense that this film is deeply problematic  i feel the problem is not that it is too sympathetic to childrapists etc as some may see but rather the opposite  it holds these characters up for our fascinated yet horrified perusal one moment daring us to laugh at them another moment priming us to feel sorry for them then undercutting that pity with horror or with distancing irony  the strategy works powerfully at times and evokes some moments of true thoughtprovocation that confession scene with the pedophile father and his son being the best example but it is also sometimes all too predictable  once i had made it some way into the show i began to distance myself and see the director pulling on the strings of the audience and the characters  but the film for all its cleverness does rely on some rather pat old cliches the fat and lonely girl who craves attention from the equally fat and lonely neighbour who fantasises about the slim beautiful neighbour the psychiatrist whos a pervert the grime lurking beneath the perfect gotitall american dream family etc what is undeniable is the excellence of the cast who do imbue the characters with a sense of humanity even while the script and direction so often frame them with cheap irony,black_comedy
finally a balzy film with unapologetic black humor perversion and depravity its like a liveaction robert crumb strip as there are no heros standard or anti no you cant sympathize with the charactersyoure not supposed tothere are no corny morals to be learned and more importantly no redemptionwhich certainly puts it in the league with a clockwork orange,black_comedy

now focuses on the titular anthropomorphic teddy bear in having his own life of marriage and plans ahead of getting a nonbiological child this leads to a strangely interesting conflict about gaining civil rights to a teddy bear and its stranger that at some point the movie does take it somewhat seriously and eventually goes back to its crass hijinks its nice but nothing much compelling in the end because what obviously overshadows it is definitely the outrageous laughs but even the degree of laughs suffers the same problem its full of energy at first then it awkwardly mutes its lighter tone for its climax fans of the first may get the same pleasure that they seek but there is really nothing special to it eitherthe first half really has the strongest amount of funny moments and also brought some intrigue to the storys center but the movie apparently cannot decide what exact approach it is generally taking the outrageous comedy is still everywhere but whenever it stops by focusing on its themes it really takes it seriously like it actually believes that it is saying something important but the movie hardly earns anything to deserve that attention its just shifting from its outrageous nature to a sudden gravity back and forth even for a comedy that is actually just fooling around it stills displays a mind of uncertainty there is also some bits of attempting to replicate broadway with dance numbers and a song cant tell if thats one of the movies way of tripping or the director just wants to show off that he can do a musical either way it rather feels nothing more than a random filler the movie is also a little too long the movie hitting the same major problem of the first film by setting up a climax that its supposed to drive tension it never felt right for the film even worse its more like a rehash reintroducing the same villain except it takes place in a different location its rather awkward and tedious than effectivethe sentiment doesnt felt convincing enough for the movies true colors but then its all about the humor and if the humor works then there is a worthy roar of laughter to get from this film predictably raunchy pot fueled and consists pop culture references that will certainly be enjoyed if you understand the language of a seth macfarlane comedy its fun if it really tries to be fun the performances from its lead actors are still a joy to watch macfarlane still manages to put energy to the talking teddy bear and mark wahlberg is still committo fool around as man child best frienddoesnt bring the same surprise of the first one but if youre in for more outrageous laughs from this profane talking teddy bear then it wont be a problem as long as youre not expecting too much the film does try to bring on an important theme but its not as effective or as strong as it wanto be it does make some interesting arguments just doesnt have any powerful or at least earned conclusion to it but hell who would exactly take that seriously anyway well no more than the movie itself it should have been shorter the storyline should have been tighter and the third act should have tried harder than repeating its predecessor again it can be really funny it just suffers handling its ideas better,comedy
if there was a 65 i would give it because there was a lot to like in this movie i like mark wahlberg i like the bear i like amanda seyfried and there were a lot of good laughs in this movie good oneliners and good recurring gagshowever it just wasnt enough to make up for a horrible plot the plot is liffrom miracle on 43rd street but it is not christmas is not santa somehow does not rise to the mythical level of santa this is not a movie for kids and the movie falls flat markie mark is same as ever and i do enjoy him kudos to amanda seyfried who tries so hard to make the romance story line work but i could never get past the fact that i was watching mw and as and a wisecracking stuffed bear some good laughs yes a good story not even close,comedy
i really cant understand why many critics went harsh on this onethe film is jutwith quality humour  social political and personal it lives up to the expectations and doesnt slack anywhere at all it makes us laugh but also makes us uneasy at times not because of crassness but because it reveals the underbelly of our social setupi am waiting for  i sincerely hope mcfarlene considers it should run up for governor or president it will fit in nicely with the us presidentials in 2016 and should reveal the shallowness of modern political campaigninggo seth go,comedy
in 2012 when seth macfarlanes directorial debut was released i like many other people enjoyed it a lot it was a basic film about a man and his senile teddy bear who would just smoke weed swear a lot and hang out that premise was enough to get us on board and it worked for a one off feature film after the box office success it received a sequel was inevitable but how could a film with such a premise possibly do anything more to become a franchise well not only does ramp up the laughs it also gives us a surprisingly strong plot and pulls it off wellthe basic premise is that has married tammilynn from the first film whereas john has divorced lori following some marital problems decides to save his marriage with a baby but in order to do this he has to prove that he is a person and not just property in the eyes of the law enter sam l jackson amanda seyfried and yes as you would expect there are many references to the hollywood star i knew mila kunis was not coming back for this film and after her performance in the lacklustre a million ways to die in the west i was not expecting seyfried to be a good replacement but she fits in with the cast very well just like the first film the chemistry between john mark wahlberg and seth macfarlane is what makes the comedy work so well you really believe you are watching two real life friends hang out rather than mark wahlberg and a cgi teddy bear the plot wasnt what made the first so enjoyable it was their bond amanda seyfried fits in with these two so well and as a trio they really mesh well together she brings a lot of laughs to the table and i actually liked her character more than mila kunis whilst the plot is very good and holds up the third act takes a bit of a plunge and almost copies the last act of the first film completely giovanni risbi reprises his role as donny and does exactly what he did originally just for a slightly different reason the film could have done without this to focus more on the human elements even though it was hilarious to see ninja turtle raphael dance to i think were alone now it almost felt like filler to make a longer movie the small road trip segment to me was great we got spoofs of both planes trains and automobiles and a great jurassic park spoof in the space of a couple of minutes in fact the pop culture references from rocky to flash gordon sam j jones returns were pretty great i also loved the courtroom scenes and even morgan freeman in an extended cameo provided us with a very good look at what human rights are all aboutwhat i wanfrom this film was to laugh which i did a lot more than i expecto as well which is a bonus look out for a hysterical cameo from liam neeson the is a human storyline felt like a bold and wonderful step forward and brings up way more questions about human rights than any seth macfarlane production should but not in a bad way at all it focuses a lot less on the drugs and crude jokes even though they are very much still there but the way it was execuwas just great i wish the third act had stuck with it but by the end if you are a fan of seth macfarlanes work such as family guy you will come out satisfied after plenty of laughs and a surprising amount of heart will we get a most likely but if it keeps up what did right then i just might be okay with that,comedy
the truth is that exhausitself right in the trailer and the rest of film was kind of superfluous but it was cute to see a dumb summer movie that doesnt take itself too seriously and is occasionally funny on the other hand takes itself much too seriously in trying to deal with the humanity of seriously what can a potheads and fart jokes movie tell us about being human lots of recycled jokes from and as the main comic attraction in the movie just doesnt work anymore there are a few good jokes and visual gags as befitting a summer comedy but the rest are only marginally funny with a boring movie plot that connects them you can see it if you happen to be home and stoned with nothing better to do ,comedy
after seeing the first film i was hugely excifor this film while also being a bit nervous because sequels of comedies are never usually as good and this one follows that tradition the premise of this film sees and john attempting to get civil rights so he and tammy lynn can have a baby now seth mcfarlane plays the voice of and just like the first film he is great in this film as the voice of this foul mouthed teddy bear some of the things he says is hilarious and he even makes you care about this bear because he is so lovable mark wahlberg returns as john and once again he and chemistry is off the charts and is probably the best part of the film also wahlberg shows off his comedic chops in this film and it really does work amanda seyfried joins the cast in this film and she was also really good in this film and made me laugh she also fits in really well in this film with john and however i didnt feel the character of tammy lynn was that good and i just didnt feel like her character was funny in this film which didnt help also for some weird reason giovanni ribisi is back in his role from the first film and it felt completely forced and completely unnecessary now what i liked about the first film is that even though it was a comedy it had a heart felt story to it that makes you care about the characters this film is all over the place with its narrative structure and i felt like the story was really forgotten about and nobody cared about it it could have been interesting but it didnt have the substance that it should have done there was allot of funny dialogue in the film that will really make you laugh but there is also some dialogue that falls flat and you will just be sat there bored waiting for the next good joke that comes around there is some really funny scenarios in this film with some good cameos but once again it just feels like it is a bunch of comedy skits and nothing to go with the cameos overall this is an average comedy that you wont really care to see again,comedy
lets talk about it ok i saw this film 2 months ago at an early screening and unlike a few idiots on here i actually kept my mouth shut due to the embargo and quiet possibly getting sued if i let any info slip lol anyways i enjoyed this movie a ton lets get one thing straight here if you didnt like the 1st or you dont like anything seth mcfarlane relathen stay away this movie isnt for you and it wont change your mind about anything i loved the first and i knew that this movie might be a weak sequel like most sequels are now in days and surprise surprise it actually exceeded my expectations is almost as good as the first almost one of my concerns was the cast change i hate when movies replace or change characters in sequels so i felt that mila kuniss absence was going to be very obvious and there would be a hole in this movie that the new lead amanda seyfried just could not fill and another surprise her character worked to perfection the chemistry that she had with mark wahlberg and seth mcfarlane was just amazing i was like theres no way she could be better than mila and boom she nailed itthe story most of you may already know from the trailers gets married and then the state says is property and not a person so the marriage is annulled and he basically loses everything so the story worked the first movie focused more on john and this one is more about i had no real complaints with this film there is a cameo with liam neeson which imo was just pointless and not that funny there are some moments where they try too hard with the jokes or to be shocking but besides a few nitpicks i had no complaints with this movie it is laugh out loud funny it has serious moments similar to the first and its just a fun film there are some returning characters and i wont spoil that and ohh yeah the comic con scene in this film with patrick warburton and the running gag they have going on is super hilarious im giving an 8510,comedy
i was so looking forward to after really enjoying the first onewhat a disappointmentbasically is married to a hot girl and tries to get a baby to save his marriage however it all goes wrong and is investigaand the state say he is not a person so he loses all his rights job and marriage than has a court battle to prove he is a person which he eventually wins with the help of john his best buddy and girlfriend lawyer such a boring plot really bad the old enemy donny tries to get as he is regarded as just property in attempt to make hasbro rich  this gets foiled by john who saves tedthere are some funny bits to the movie like jurassic park bit where they see cannabis field and some good one linershowever the film is looking and trying far too hard for jokes for every line in the movie  rather than naturally funny they try all the time to make one liners a lot of them not that funnythe cute factor of is wearing off and the magic too i was so bored after the first hour i wanto leave the jokes and sarcasm were so predictablehopefully no more films but you can guarantee they will make just for the moneynext time have a good plot and story this was very weak,comedy
the first i saw was a brilliant comedy with great idea of showing a toy for little children playing a role of a sx drgsnrockroll guy there was some jokes which hit my taste  were too disgusting  but overall whole movie was hilarious  unfortunately has got the opposite proportion of these being mostly disgusting with awkward jokes making me ill at ease scenes like a trying to wnk out a person to get his sprm tries to have a baby or john being weighed down by a cabinet full of semn containers in a sprm bank and covered with it just awful ive seen some movies with kinda same sort of humor like borat bruno  the dictator for example these were hilarious or something around that but this one goes far far lower  seeks for the bottom not recommending,comedy
usually we all know franchise movies tank after the first one but this one surprisingly was extremely funny and fun to watch i went into the movies with a negative expectation just due to previous franchised movie history the jokes were just spot on original one after another the entire theater was laughing and of their seats i loved the first and now i also love just as much i would even watch it again if another friend wants to go watch it seth is such a talencomedian and to me hes work and sense of humor is amazing i highly recommend watching this and promise that you wont be disappoinwatching this movie it is defiantly worth a trip to the movies with friends,comedy
i have not laughed in a theater that hard in i dont remember how long it was funnier than the first i am going to see it again the jokes were disgusting but that is the point if you liked the first one you will love this one if you didnt you will still find yourself laughing despite yourselfwhen you find out the reason they cannot have kids it is funny to find out why a sperm donor wont work when they see ton bradys equipment it is priceless the twist at the end will have you wondering what the heck is going on but is funny as anything as well the comicon seen with patrick warburton dressed up as the tick whom he did the voice for was just spot on the movie references sped at you one after another i tried to keep track but i am sure there were a few i missed se how many you can spot,comedy
first off the negative reviews are absolutely laughabletheres no way you can be a fan of and family guy and not like this movie period or youre lying about being a true seth fan because youd know what to expect from him follows the exact same comedic formula as lots of curse words and sex jokes and no holds barred to the max there are lots of cameos i was pretty shocked how many people seth convinced to take part in this movie the comedy is exactly what youd expect crude nasty no lines are drawn in the sand there is obviously drug use and fights and arguments and downright touching moments to balance it all out as well as plenty of adventure the plot goes from serious to hilarious many times during the film but why wouldnt anyone expect that does the same thing either way if youre into crude humor that likes to intentionally cross lines and annoy the politically correct this movie is perfect and there are tons of f bombs in this movielotsobviously,comedy
movie was hilarious besides certain awkward scenes especially the introduction they could of done without mark walberg never considered him a funny actor but he has done very well in this movie franchise seth macfarlane is a talencomedian director and creator the girl from dear john did very well filling mila kunis shoes usually sequels bomb but not this film very impressed how funny it came out story line was mediocre but funny scenes made up for it usually sequels are over budget big propaganda and it starat first but the funny dialogue and thr hilarious scenes made not only myself but the people at the movie theater rotten tomatoes rathis a 40 what the hell dothey know they always give crappy rating for funny movies and as soon as they get a check from a crappy movie they rate those high they are a insult not only to me but to all the real movie buffs so sit back and enjoy it people mike sanchez popcorn n movie,comedy
im not the biggest fan of mila kunis nor am i a huge fan of seth macfarlane but despite my hesitations i liked the original quite a bit for a variety of reasons despite its obvious crudeness it had some character development and poignancy that the film medium was able to afford macfarlane that a tv cartoon wasnt able to as much of an ostensibly bro movie as it was it had some subversive commentary on the male id and mila kunis character was written quite well she didnt come across as the harping shrill female stereotype so often seen in movies about male arresdevelopment see saving silverman for every time wahlberg and his teddy bear seemed to have a valid reason to continue their destructive friendship she had an equally valid reason that they shouldnthow disappointing then that opens with kunis character lazily written off discarded by wahlbergs character as the wrong woman or something to such an effect so that macfarlane can introduce a new love interest in the form of amanda seyfried who is a fine actress in better written roles but simply isnt given the same level of material to work with herethe other memorable aspect of was simply the novelty factor pottymouthed teddy bear this was a simple premise that appealed to everyone everywhere which is why it was one of the rare blockbuster comedies to make a lot of money overseasbut now we have and the novelty is worn off the balance of the first film is gone too the crudeness there was offset with surprisingly sweet characterdriven moments here because we dont really believe the characters from the onset see kunis character being shrugged off there really arent as many tender moments none of it really rings true it just seems like a typical sequel going through the motions trying to replicate the original but inevitably failing to do so simply because the appeal is a oneoff it kind of reminds me of the hangover sequelslike the hangover sequels this isnt as bad as the critics might lead you to believe its not a terrible film its safe to say that if you liked the original youll at least find this an entertaining enough diversion for a onetime viewing i also dug that they brought back giovanni ribisi the best part of the first film despite the fact that his inclusion made no sense whatsoeverbut this simply isnt as clever funny wellwritten or  frankly  surprisingly tender and sweet as the first movie its a decent rental but i hope theres no,comedy
first let me say the movie seeks to push the limit of profane talk and crudeness beyond anything before no spoiler here i wouldnt watch it to the end just so you can get a sample of what to expect the rest of this will be using the language in the movie if you dont like profanity avoid this movie and skip to the end of this reviewlet me fing tell you about the st this fing movie goes into its not just fing gay sx explained in detail its every perverse fing kind of st you can ever fing hearif they used beeping to block the profanity most of the movie would be a long beep no i couldnt watch to the shty fing end of this stupid fing filthy pervermovie so the ending is a mysteryamerica needs to bring back some kind of censors thats the bottom line this is fing out of control the kind of st they put in this crpy movie about avery 7 seconds on average is another fing cuss word dam thats a lot of fing cussing they tried to outdo hboif you have any kind of family values even faintly avoid this movieyou walk away from the movie thinking that having the christian church get back into governmentcourts to prosecute people from crimes of debauchery is a good thing we should really literally consider doing this,comedy
seth macfarlene along with mark wahlberg returns as the trashtalking teddy bear who brought the laughs and fun in this sequel to 2012s hit comedy mila kunis however was unable to return as mark wahlbergs girlfriend from the first film this time around has married tamilynn jessica barth his feisty girlfriend from the first film one years passes by they begin dealing with marital problems until hatches an idea for them to have a baby hoping it would solve marriage problems his plans only ends harder than he expecto make matter worse the government rules that is not a human citizen which results in him losing his jobs losing his bank account and having his marriage with tamilynn annulled in attempt to get his life back together and his buddy john bennett mark wahlberg get help from a lawyer named sam amanda seyfried for a court case to prove he should be considered humanafter seeing the first film i was more than excifor a sequel as most sequels to comedies go i didnt expect this to be as good as the first one however it ended being almost as good as the first film it contained plenty of hilarious dialogue that had me laughing almost constantly yes the dialogue is pretty raunchy and vulgar like it was in the first film or perhaps even more so nonetheless i was satisfied with it the gags were pretty funny especially during the scene when and john were visiting the hospital to get sperm for baby there are a few grossout scenes that may not be funny to everyone the hospital scene being a perfect example was funny as ever and often stole the show with his offthewall humor mark wahlberg was also quite funny as well perhaps even more so than in the first movie in this one his character is even more dumb and often lead and himself into the most hysterical and unpleasant shenanigans i also pleased by the casting of amanda seyfried as the lawyer who helps john and during their mission i think her character was very clever and well written even if she wasnt as funny as and john the storyline was okay even though i felt that the film could had a better plot this film may have gotten mixed reviews but i think it deserves higher if you loved the first film there is a very good chance you will enjoy this one even if it may not level with the first one it is still worth seeing,comedy
let me start by saying that i had an open mind when i first walked into this film i heard that the first movie was supposed to be really good even though i had not seen it im glad i didnt throw away time on the first one either this movie is basically a really long and unfunny episode of family guy it was filled with immature poop jokes and sexual references that are funny to all the immature 5 year olds in the audience if they wanto make money from this film dare it be called one they shouldve pitched it to young adults and kids and made it pg13 because im not sure what kind of immature adults would want to watch a teddy bear curse and make poop jokes let me also state that i actually like family guy i think its a really funny and well written show but the writers of this must have been on crack when they made it overall i think is way too over hyped and unfunny its a mess of stupid and unfunny jokes thatll only have the 5 year olds laughing hysterically,comedy
so last night finally i have seen this flick and except few scenes i didnt find it much appreciable and good honestly set my expectations so high so i was eagerly waiting for and finally when i saw it i found no thrill and nothing similar to i know every sequences and next parts can not be same as earlier one but this was not deserving for an applausethose who liked this movie good for them i didnt like it personally so just came here to warn those guys who loved and set their expectations so high for 2it could be better with some logic and more depth into the characterization chemistry between thunder buddies was not as it was in tedmany other things are lacking but i dont want to discuss anymore i have already wasmy 2 hours behind this movie ,comedy
if you are a 1214 year old male with low or no standards for comedy who wants to be a slacker when you grow up you may love this movie although i really like mark wahlberg and think he is the best thing about this film i really disliked it overall like you couldnt tell i laughed three times liam neeson apples on the roof and the first black cock apart from that in my opinion this movie tries to lower the level of the lowest common denominator yes it is true that i also dislike family guy and had i realized who is behind i would not have seen it at all i dont understand people spend their money andor time on nobrow entertainment is just dumb and its definitely last for me,comedy
this movie was not funny at all i guess it is the second movie i couldnt finish watching in my entire life the lines are so cheesy the story is so childish and it seems they wrote the scenario in a week if you are looking for some real comedy then you are in a wrong place you will never get back this 120 minutes of your life back such a shame for morgan freemans name to put on this film the jokes are so not funny and they wanna make fun out of f words all the time you might think the whole idea of the movie is unrealistic thats right but you can use some real humor in the most unrealistic situations conclusion i wont recommend this notacomedymovie even for watching once,comedy
i thought the first was decent enjoyed the first few seasons of family guy and love american dad hell i even thought a million ways to die in the west was ok with that said i thought this was horrible the first half hour or so was decent some good jokes and cameos however once amanda seyfried and the whole plot with trying to be recognized as a citizen starts its all downhill from there this almost feels like less than a movie than 2 hours of rejecfamily guy jokes and stale popculture references the writing here is incredibly lazy and several jokes are repeamultiple times throughout the entire film like the first film there are also a few jokes that are taken straight out of family guy theres even one joke at the end thats taken right from dumb  dumber to my biggest problem though is the fact that its 2 hours when there is absolutely no reason it needs to be the whole subplot with giovanni ribisi served no purpose to the film what so ever and could have easily been cut out and the whole road trip segment just felt like an excuse for a really lame weed joke and to crowbar in seyfrieds song wahlbergs character and were a lot more annoying and douchier as well which didnt help i also didnt like how the film shoves in this whole message about civil rights after spending nearly 2 hours making a ton of crappy race and gay jokes that just felt smug of macfarlane to do overall this was a painfully unfunny and incredibly lazy sequel even if you are a fan of the first i wouldnt recommend it i saw it with a group of 6 people and none of us liked it its stuff like this that really shows that macfarlane can be a bit of a hack if you ask me,comedy
people giving this film a 8 or 10 or even 7 amazing me to no end they must have an iq of less than 50 for them to love a film where a filthy mouth teddy bear is supposed to funnyif you think this film is great and you think repeating the f word over and over again is brilliant writing with a paper thin plot than that speaks volumes of where you come from come to think of it it you live in the sewers all your life the smell will not bother you anymoresince you are used to smelling the filth that you have absorbed  then this film would be great just like the places you have been dwelling most of your life,comedy
rating  out of 4 this film is not recommendedin brief has its share of laughs but only if you like offcolor and offensive humorgrade cthat cute but crude pottymouthed teddy bear is back and so is writer director seth macfarlane offering more heaping helpings of sophomoric jokes and political incorrect humor again mr macfarlane seems more interesin offending the masses and mocking any minority groups with an onslaught of racial and homophobic references than setting up a coherent story with genuine laughs but that is is trademark formula which seems to work for him excluding his last film a million ways to die in the west which died a million ways with his fan base id say he walks a fine line but thats quite a broad stroke he is traveling in 2it is now three years since our last meeting has married a dimwitbimbo and his human buddy has not had much luck in the dating game but both have enough time to drink beer and smoke pot to occupy their days much as before only now a problem arises with marriage being legal so its off to court we go as they engage a young pretty attorney who takes their casethe film starts off very promising with its opening credits a wonderful sendup to the old busby berkeley musicals but the rest of the film never hits this stride after that its non stop sex and drug jokes that purport the smutty and bawdy lockerroom mentality macfarlane has build his career on this sequel is more of the same as before with no risk only risqu subtlety is not in his reach nor is stinging satire he hides behind shock humor rather than allow his jokes to flow with the narrativemore often than not this film has a nice directorial touch and some good comic timing but more not than often do his skills as a screenwriter hit their intended marks much of the humor is overdone and lacks any finesse as he aims to ridicule easy targets comic con losers improv performers bong and penis jokes are plentiful cameos by tom brady sam j jones and liam neeson fall flat one can see that macfarlane is going for deeper themes this time around with civil rights marriage equality and discrimination as the underlying issue but he is still unable to delve into any measurable depth as he continuously sacrifices his meandering plot for a nasty zinger or grossout gags the cgi of and the voiceover work by macfarlane again are the films saving grace the duality of cute vs vulgar works for the most part as for its cast most perform adequately some stronger than others with many loyal friends and performers again availing their services to his films mark wahlberg handles most of the duties and he manages to use his personable assets reasonably well to come away unblemished as does jessica barth as trashy wife amanda siegfried gives one of her better performances and is developing some comic chops morgan freeman john slattery patrick warburton michael dorn and giovanni ribisi are wasfor me some of the gags worked others did not it was hitandmiss all the way depending on ones own comfort level of offcolor material could be highly distasteful or very funny macfarlane follows the same lewd formula in this sequel its his comfort zone to make others feel uncomfortable his target audience knows his brand of politically incorrect humor andhumor as we all know is in the gut of the beholdervisit my blog at wwwdearmoviegoercomany comments please contact me at jadepietrorcncom,comedy
this film tells the story of a talking teddy bear who sues the government so that he gets recognised as a human being and get human rights such as marriage and drivers licenseis a hugely politically incorrect film with a lot of swearing sexual and crude humour it is not usually a type of film i like but does have a way to get to my heart it is sweet and emphasises a lot of love and friendship towards the end the film gets very touching and it made my eyes well uphaving a touching plot together with a funny script makes very entertaining way more entertaining than i expected,comedy
as we know from experience the sequels to this type of movies are usually not even slightly close to being as good as the original and are much worse was not the case for me really enjoyed watching this movie most of the jokes were really funny and not forced like the first one the movie has a couple of absolutely hilarious cameosamanda seyfried was a great addition she is really funny and plays a much bigger role in the movie then i expeci really bought the chemistry between all three main characters the movie has a lot of heart and you can feel that these friends really really love and care about each othermy main and probably the only problem with the film was that it was a little too long many scenes were dragged out and definitely could use some fat cuttingoverall very funny still cant decide which one of the two movie i liked more,comedy
newlywed couple and tamilynn want to have a baby but in order to qualify to be a parent will have to prove hes a person in a court of law the subtext for this film is rich and one could easily equate dilemma with most minorities and the heavy subject matter is handled with crass humor and over the top stoner gems did i mention the bear likes to get high seth mac farlane is known for wit from the tv shows family guy and american dad and his step into feature films have at least from my behalf always been interesting to watch he tackled his first feature film sans the family guy characters then moved onto a million ways to die in the west and now his style of humour includes jokes without the drum roll to let the audience know that was a punchline its the sitcom without the laughing most audiences need to know when the end of the joke has arrived and the lack thereof is a macfarlane trade that works so well at least for the fans and if youre a fan then this second run at the inappropriate little teddy is well worth itthe reference to amanda seyfrieds eyes again is golden in the western film a million ways to die in the west is this hilarious scene where charlize theron cant believe amanda is so blind with eyes that big it makes me laugh just thinking about it now in they dig even deeper with a visual comparison that leaves me laughing as i write keep your eyes out for itthe film did have one too many unnecessary establishing shots which merely drags a film trimming the fat would have made the films pace so much more enjoyable heres an example theyre in the hospital room something goes wrong and they need to move to the waiting room then theres the establishing shot of the hospital and to the waiting room the establishing shot was unnecessary because we already know were in a hospital just trim the fatother than that is very enjoyable a great crude comedy that is relentless with the jokes finding ways to pull a giggle from the audience at every given chance,comedy
for whats considered a silly stoner buddy comedy was pretty philosophical taking on everything from pop culture to relationships to religion through the safety net filter of a foulmouthed pot smoking teddy bear seth mcfarland could channel everything he loathed without restraint and providing the voice of the titular doll turned humanlike sidekick of mark wahlbergs sweetnatured boston slacker john the sky was the limitlike any comedy sequel the main agenda here is to go so overboard fans will forget the past right off the bat is a dance number opening credit sequence as if seths oscar gig inspired an extravaganza that might lead to something maybe not better but definitely bigger this time around nothing doingwith a semiserious plot about going to court to prove hes human enough to have a baby with his wife a new love interest for the divorced john in cool chick lawyer amanda seyfried a pointless road trip and a handful of lazy cameos seeming like guests at a strangers funeral doesnt try for anything really that would push the envelop any further in this bland vehicle too contained to be extemporaneous too restrained to be raucous too reserved to be controversial and using the same lame villain cant even die with dignity,comedy
seth macfarlanes foulmouthed teddy bear is back for a second installment in accompanying him is his stoner bestfriend john mark whalberg and his stoner attorney samantha amanda seyfried as they smoke weed and try to prove in a court of law that is a sentient being entitled to his civil rights did i mention they smoke a lot weed the film is riddled with the type of crass humour we have come to expect from seth macfarlane the anythinggoes creator of family guy the opening half hour has the seth macfarlane stamp thoroughly imprinthroughout with race jokes sexual innuendo and enough swears to make quentin tarantino blush the problem with isnt the number of offensive jokes if anything the second half could use a lot more where the movie runs to ground is with its terrible pacing is three different movies rolled into one we have the main storyline where takes on the courts to prove that he is a person and not someones property subsequently there is the kidnapping subplot recycled from the first movie in order to pry open and see what makes him come to life which if youve watched the first movie we already know the outcome of on top of it all we have the blossoming romance between john and samanthawhile macfarlane is known for using sentimental moments here it feels overbearing and really slows the film down mark whalberg was likable enough in the first movie and had plausible chemistry with his love interest mila kunis who came to her senses and did not reprise her role in the sequel without her he is just along for the easy paycheck by the end whatever thoughtfulness the movie scored based on sentimental value is lost in a shambolic slapstick comiccon finale starved of laughswhen you go to an ma movie staring a drug abusing foulmouth teddy bear you expect more it seems apparent that seth wants to move on from just doing comedies and is trying to instill his range  and this is not the place to do so 2s redeeming qualities come in the form of a few funny cameos and the odd side gag reminisced of family guys cutaways gags 35 10,comedy
seth macfarlane yet again proves that his brand of humour isnt everyones cup of tea in fact its not for many with his latest feature length film was all about the thunder buddies and the ups and downs of their relationship the second takes a completely different approach instead of mocking political subjects which focuses on macfarlane fills up its long runningtime by abusing celebrities with distasteful dick jokes and awkward racism this time round the puns invoke little or no reaction mila kunis is sorely missed replaced by a reputable but unconvincing amanda seyfried as a lawyer john bennett walhberg and macfarlane relationship never flourishes past the first film big shock when its their banter and wild antics that made the so outrageously entertaining,comedy
is trying to prove in court that he is a person and not property like many many other sequels that follow successful movies is disappointing think dump and dumper to the story is just too boring and you can guess whatll happen next way too easily and its a pity cause it does start well and promising the jokes about pop culture and their lawyers ignorance of it get tiring after a while repeating them and they are not the ones being repeathe movie repeats pretty much the whole story of the first one with the villain trying to get his hands on the addition of some action does not add anything to the movie that simply fails to entertain,comedy
seth mcfarlane is going to hell but me and millions of others will be right there with him in r 155 the writerdirectorstar uses almost every bad word in the english language glorifies illicit drug use makes about the crudest jokes imaginable offends groups of different races ethnic persuasions and sexual orientations and indirectly makes fun of several tragic news stories from the past decade and a half and most of it is absolutely hilarious you might say that he had me and the rest of the nonstuffed animals in the theater in stitchespicks up a few years after the story in mcfarlanes 2012 surprise hit left off manchild john bennett mark wahlberg is six months divorced from lori collins his girlfriend in the first movie as johns living teddy bear and best friend played again by seth mcfarlane using his voice and motion capture technology is about to marry tamilynn mccafferty jessica barth his girlfriend from the last movie its not long before and tamilynn are having problems the financial strain of living off of their incomes as grocery store cashiers while wanting more is leading to some nasty arguments decides that having a baby will bring them closer together and tamilynn is all inbut theres a challenge lacking the requisite anatomy to turn such a dream into a reality needs a sperm donor when three separate attempts at getting a donor go hilariously and disturbingly wrong and tamilynn decide to adopt their application is disapproved because it calls attention to the fact that is not technically a person he had been living a relatively normal life for a crude rude foulmouthed potsmoking stuffed bear but now hes in danger of losing everything he is does and cares about it seems the only answer is to sue the government for his civil rights inexperienced popculturally illiterate lawyer samantha l jackson amanda seyfried takes the casejohn is right at side through all the little guys challenges in this movie thunder buddies for life and theyre both as incorrigible as in the previous movie mocking each others misfortunes playing pranks on each other occasionally fighting and often smoking weed drinking and making comments and behaving in ways that would be considered highly inappropriate in polite society fortunately for us they dont care much about being polite and fortunately for them samantha bonds with them both and gives her all to representing them in court the story draws parallels to the historic struggle for black civil rights and the current struggle for gay rights but mainly just wants to be declared a person so he can live his life its a tall order from such a short bear his case is completely unprecedenplus plotting and waiting for to lose his case and be regarded as no more than property is his old enemy donny giovanni ribisi who is making some plans of his own with one pretty powerful personthroughout the movie were treato all manner of crass and politically incorrect humor along with great supporting turns by patrick warburton as a gay bully morgan freeman as a famous civil rights lawyer and flash gordon actor sam jones as himself plus hilarious cameos by among others tom brady and liam neeson and since this movie comes from the mind of the man who creatvs family guy there are pop culture and historical references galore including songs tv shows and movies from several different decades helped to no small degree by a key scene at a new york city comiccon with most of the participants dressing as their favorite comic book or scifi characters oh and when the movies over be sure to stay to the very end of the credits trust meis one of those rare sequels that is better than the original the movie has enough plot and enough jokes for two movies if youre openminded enough to check your attitudes toward impropriety at the door youll likely agree that much more of the humor hits than misses youll probably end up liking these characters and laughing at their antics in spite of yourself and in spite of any fear that both you and the films creator will be subject to eternal damnation for being party to such humor i hope that if you see this movie youll agree with my assessment but if not as might say f you i write these reviews for free i dont need this s im outta here but youll have to forgive the bear has no filter i will simply and politely end this review by giving an a take it or leave it people sorry,comedy
amateurish direction court scene really bad swearing to cover lack of jokes good film absolute rubbish will win lots of raspberries wanto leave early two girls left halfway through money wasfelt cheathat i paid to see this sequel seth mcfarlane should have taken more time over the script will not go to see if it is made the film i badly made the acting is dreadful the scene where walberg kisses seyfried is not good as a whole this film is a turkey no good jokes and it is slow no charm unlike should never have went please dont go waste of money as i say i feel cheated,comedy
this movie is terrifically funny it provokes laughter from start to finish it is virtually impossible not to like the character  a teddy bear that wants to be trealike a human simple ideas make for great stories as this movie proves mark wahlberg is the straight man and shows that he is one of the great comic actors what is more remarkable is that the story is actually a court room drama but involving characters that are so ridiculously lovable as to transform the story into a spoof which works as comedy everything says is funny and on point there is an edge to the humor which makes it even funnier just because is a toy doesnt mean he lacks feelings is whatever we want him to be,comedy
no spoilers here i left after about 20 minutes so i couldnt spoil it for you if i wantoif any of you are familiar with my reviews you know i find the liberal use of the fword incredibly offensive especially when some form of it is used at least once in every sentence and seemingly because the writers dont have a very large vocabulary the opening scenes are peppered with it as well as a few extremely tasteless jokes then the credits roll with a throwback backdrop of a musical of the golden age of movies and you think ok this could be funthen onto more profanity coupled with supposedly funny domestic violence and a couple of cameos the first by jay leno is embarrassing then liam neeson makes you think there might be enough vignettes like this to make the movie worthwhile but then the nword is used i dont care if it is uttered by a black actress in reference to a white couple the second time she said it i walked outwhat i really found disturbing is that some other theatergoers found several things to laugh at i live in a small community and these are my neighbors god help us,comedy
if you like stock footage and old family guy jokes this is the movie for you 911 starshere is a poem to fill the rest of the 10 required lines dont remind me of my incident i was only three this incident is about tea biscuits and me it was on a lovely summers day i was drinking lots of tea some visitors were all around they told me a joke for free i tried my hardest not the laugh as tea was in my mouth but then my nightmares did come true i spat it at a visitor which was at the direction southpoem 2 ate toast brushed teeth fixed her tap which just did leak dressed up went to school swam in the local swimming pool wrote in english class solved problems in maths in pe rolled on rolling mats looked at a map in geography found sources in history investigaa mystery walked home bathed in the lake made a lovely birthday cake put on pajamas went to bed what will he do tomorrow instead dotty ducks,comedy
does exactly what it set out to do it delivers a bunch of laughs built primarily on crude inyourface humor and it doesnt take itself too seriously seth macfarlane proves once again that he has his finger firmly on the pulse of his target demographic because the theater was in stitches throughout most of the film that being said a comedy doesnt have to sacrifice cinema in order to deliver laughs i think the first movie was a prime example of that as it was a genuinely good movie in addition to being hilarious instead macfarlane turns this movie into a liveaction version of family guy the plot is choppy and it essentially feels like a series of random skits pieced together to form the semblance of some overarcing plot it was easily worth watching because it was hilarious but i expeca quality film closer to that of the first one,comedy
i refer to imdb for all tv and movie recommendations  this is my first time giving a review ive watched  i thought it was a pretty decent movie but this movie right here was just awful abominable deplorable  egregious i wish i could put a zero because it simply does not deserve a 1 please do not watch this movie if you take life seriously  please dont waste your precious time if you value life to watch this movie when i got my refund i wanmore compensation i wangas money and an hour back of my time the writing sucked the acting was even worse i know my 10yr old nephews wouldve had a blast but im simply a bit smarter than a 5th grader to take this movie seriously iiam nelson skit was decent it made me giggle a bit but besides that this movie made me hate seth mcfarland i mean look at him he shouldnt be taken seriously,comedy
sometimes i dont understand why comedies have such bad ratings i think that is because people want too much from comedies they are a specific genre just like action scifi drama etc and what is the main thing this genre needs to produce it needs to produce fun it needs to make you laugh it doesnt need to have great plots twists actions and such i rate comedies on how much they made me laugh i look at this genre in another way than other genres and trust me this movie made laugh more than a few times it had great jokes to be honest with you it referenced movies from the past and made jokes about them it was really fun from the very beginning to the end i didnt get bored not even a little bit it exceeded my expectations because the first movie wasnt that funny well this one is twice as good i never thought that i would give a 910 for this movie but it was really funny it made me laugh so many times and i havent seen such a good comedy in a while so if you want to forget about everyday problems and if you want to laugh and have fun i recommend you to watch this movie d,comedy
the entire premise of the movies defies any reason everyone just accepts that this teddy bear is real even those who just see him on the street he would be hounded 247 by press the idea that any state would take a toy bear to court and say he is property even though he can think and speak is just stupidseth macfarlane is again the writer which means lots of crude unfunny jokes tons of non sequitur references to obscure things offensive jokes about minorities and generally dullness oh and nonstop pot references that do nothing to further the storywhy any woman would want to marry a teddy bear is beyond mei laughed about three times through the whole thingavoid,comedy
here i was thinking entourage was going to be the biggest comedic disappointment of the month and then along comes the abomination that is to prove me wrong onto his third feature film as writerdirector and seth mcfarlane appears to have run out of gas already this is somehow an even bigger dud than his sophomoric misfire a million ways to die in the west theres not a single solitary laughoutloud joke to be had in the entire dragged out runtime and all of the titterworthy gags are in the trailer a million ways may not have been as humorous as expecbut at least it had energy and ambition two elements sorely missing from a stale sequel that nobody seems interesin doing even mark whalberg  an actor who is nothing if not commit merely goes through the motions and offers up a completely inoffensive performance which in this genre is just plain offensive throw in a middaymovieish score mcfarlanes trademark fetish for misplaced musical numbers and way way too many scenes of pofaced sincerity and you have a genuine turkey of a film oh and the straw that broke the camels back an utterly awful liam neeson cameo that makes him look like an amateur ugh its that bad,comedy
the last thing hollywood wants to do is either insult or offend individuals groups races religions causes genders and ideologies with their films the refreshing thing about the hilarious teddy bear satire and its unapologetic sequel is that neither have any such compunctions seth macfarlane who coscripdirecand provided the titular teddy bears voice spends most of saying and showing subject matter most respectable people would think twice about before either saying or showing like its iconoclastic predecessor bears an rrating for what the motion picture association of america considers crude and sexual content pervasive language and some drug use the subversive humor either will make you cringe in horrific revulsion or howl in gleeful elation if you enjoyed with its cretinous heroes beyond borderline gross out humor wanton drug abuse and impertinent profanity youll love this highbrow sequel the worst thing you can say about is it is pretentious from start to finish clearly macfarlane and family guy coscribes alec sulken and wellesley wild sought to overshadow the lowbrow original and they have triumphed in this respect if you havent seen you probably wont understand half of the hilarity during a thunderstorm young john bennett clutched his hasbro teddy and made a wish it would come to life and it did subsequently they became thunder buddies for life virtually everybody from reprises their roles in except mila kunis according to the internet movie database kunis didnt return as lori because she was pregnant during the production with ashton kutchers baby meantime macfarlane and his coscribes explain that john bennett mark wahlberg of contraband and she divorced for six months before the outset of the action a dejecjohn is petrified of getting himself involved in another relationship and his life has spiraled out of control meantime and tamilynn jessica barth of next marry but their marriage has degenerainto a disaster they argue about finances

toy company hasbro didnt endow with sex organs our hero must search for the ideal sperm donor they approach flash sam j jones but he complains about his low sperm count john suggests patriots quarterback tom brady now things get really bizarre john and sabotage bradys air conditioner so he has to sleep with his bedroom balcony windows open these two nitwits set out to obtain a sperm sample from brady while he is asleep decks himself out like a seafaring fisherman for the occasion and john is appalled to learn that he must masturbate brady fortunately for everybody involved brady awakens

of euphoric potsmoking ensue with our heroes and heroine smoking in public places toojust when everything appears to be working out favorably for our heroes the villainous donnie from surfaces donnie giovanni ribisi of public enemies has gotten a job as a janitor now at hasbro he interrupts hasbro executive tom jessup john carroll lynch of zodiac during a hallway conference and tells him that he doesnt flip the cakes in his urinal instead he replaces them naturally jessup doesnt know what to make of this sinister cretin later donnie has a moment with jessup in jessups office because hasbro has an opendoor policy with its employees the news is out that is going to court to determine what his status in society is donnie tells jessup if the prosecution can prove that is actually property rather than a person they can abduct him with minor legal consequences slice him open and fathom what makes so singular jessups eyes gleam at the prospect of eviscerating so hasbro can manufacture a new teddy that will sell millions mind you the talking teddy still looks as adorable as he did in first film you never get the impression the cast was interacting with nothing when the cgi was onscreen with them while dominates the action with his woes mark wahlbergs john stands out as his best friend until and now again with wahlberg has deviararely from playing a straightup conventional role model wasp protagonist as he did initially with wahlberg appears to be poaching on adam sandler territory with some of his absurd antics the splashy scene in the sperm facility and the loony episode in tom bradys mansion make john the butt of the jokes and wahlberg displays no inhibitions to playing second banana to while ridiculing himself in the process the dialogue again qualifies as quotable material with politically incorrect meanings although the sight gags are amusing this aboveaverage grossout comedy serves up some pretty impudent shenanigans indeed if vulgar humor poses no problems is right for you,comedy
there were a lot of funny bits in this movie but when you hear one sex joke after another for the entire movie especially the first 3045 minutes it just gets disgusting and old i alternabetween having some good laughs and wanting to just get up and leavealso why does every recent comedy have to throw one gay reference after another at us we get it hollywood  you want to desensitize everyone to gay men take a deep breath and give it a restif movies like this just resisthe urge to go to the well over and over with the same tired jokes and stuck to what made them funny in the first place they would be so much better i still think the concept of is great and there were enough good jokes to make it funny but im not sure id even watch it again because of the cringe factor from all the raunchy jokes,comedy
i saw it at the advance screening it is not as good as but only by a star or two sequels rarely are anyway liking it does not make you a sophomoric member of a happy madison audience disliking it does not make you a humorless slug hating it without giving it a fair chance andor sticking around it for some reason does this is not going to win movie of the year but thats because inside out pretty much already hasthe film delivers exactly what it promises a swearing stoner teddy bear who fights for his civil rights so he can have the custody of a child if youve come for that and a good time with a 35 star 70 65 film made by seth macfarlane youre in the right place better than a million ways i liked that too but decide for yourself,comedy
i remember the first movie being more jammed packed with jokes and gags not that does not make me roll on the floor with laughterbut in this movie attempts to adopt a baby after marring tami lynn only to have the system catch up with him and realize that hes not a real person but someones property so goes to court for his civil rights a beautifully message especially at this time with the movie suggesting the plot was inspired by the fight for same sex marriage or considering what a pop culture junkie seth macfarlane is he probably was mostly inspired by the 80s movie short circuit 2 which has a similar concept its a good plot line that makes you think about what it means to be a real person the whole layout reminds me more of seths other animaseries american dad which had a lot of episodes that had a strong message layered under fart jokesits a no brainier for those of us who love family guyi recognized one of the sight gags from the animaseries coming to liveaction in the movie and for those of us who are pop culture junkies my biggest laughs are when they go to comic con and then there is a huge chunk of the sequel a really big one with the concept of equalityto grasp a new demographic and prove to the world that macfarlene is not a complete jerkits a good message about humanity but it does make less funny than but its still worth seeing,comedy
is the sequel to the very successful which happens to be my favourite comedy of all time so after the trailers you could say i was looking forward to seeing what this could bring and it did a pretty good job at including a lot of the crude humour you would expect from this sequel i thought it had many funny moments that were well spread out over the entire film a good amount were just funny while there were a few really really funny moments unfortunately almost all of those really really funny moments were in the trailer so you knew they were coming as well as the funny jokes there were also quite a few that fell flat i will put them into two categories to make it easier the jokes that were obviously there to try and top what was done in the first film and the jokes they reused multiple times throughout the film and there were like 45 jokes they used at multiple moments and it did get exhausting by the end what it was missing was some more unpredictable jokes that the first film had it did have a few that completely catch you off guard but a lot are predictable so that was a little letdown the plot it was alright i guess but who cares its not the focus of the film where you have a swearing teddy bear so when stuff happens you just go with it it moved pretty fast but it also slowed down at times the jokes really determined where the plot was going to go oh and there is a side plot that i wont spoil because you dont know about it from the trailers but it is so dreadfully boring and brings down the film a lot it was just boring and felt like it was out of place and thrown in there just to add another 30 minutes to the film so yeah the film could have cut that 30 minutes out and it would have been much better but in the end offers the crude and unpredictable jokes you want so that aspect you will like if you liked the first film unfortunately there is not enough of that to make it as good as its predecessor if you just completely zone out during the side plot you will not miss a thing and will make for a better experience  67,comedy
well what can i say i enjoyed enjoyed the movie but after the 1st its very hard to follow up on ive watched it once and i couldnt watch it again as its a shame as i would for sure watch the 1st again not as half as funny as the 1st ted,comedy
the first one was funny but the sequel is a little better cause it has adventure and misadventure to put the character and his friends into why i liked better than hot tub time machine 2 well the hot tub sequel could not make any of the gags work they threw anything out there and it really shows and nobody was interesting and likable but in was the total opposite you really like the characters despite the stupid things they do leave it to seth macfarlane who can make you be charmed by foul humor and gross out gagstedvoiced by seth macfarlane wants to have a baby with his wife but then he is questioned by the law he is human or property mark wahlberg and seth macfarlane where funny and have a great comic chemistry so does amanda seyfried has there lawyer i mean you see that they where having the best time making this at times it feels like you are watching a family guy episode at times cause of all the homages to other classics all the other supporting cast do well also this film is like dumb and dumber to not great films but funny and entertaining films if you are not into to this then you avoid this then,comedy
there is a rating system in these reviews with one being awful well i didnt give it a one but its close to it what is it about seth mcfarlane that studios want to give him money to make feature films the sequel to did not bring a hint of laughter to me i had watched the first film and couldnt sit through it and never had any inclination to watch it again now comes and i did the same thing i though at least this would make up for the first one but it didnt it left me humorless with mcfarlanes million ways to die in the west i looked for the funny but sat through that epic lemon without protest with its just not funny to me yeah i get the joke but these are doa jokes the sperm jokes were too easy to telegraph who didnt see a cart of sperm falling on mark wahlberg must have went to get popcorn and the dope smoking lawyer was just lazy writing why couldnt she have turrets and have ticks mcfarlanes limior perhaps overused range of dope crude humor drugs and musical dance numbers has its limits to an audience the musical dance number just laid there for the audience the silence was just a precursor for things to comethe next time a studio gives seth mcfarlane money to make a film use it as toilet paper instead,comedy
i dont know how but in what concerns to seth macfarlane i always preferred american dad to family guy and i think thats why i couldnt like this movie more i liked very much of the first one much because the whole concept was surprising and fresh with this sequel i believe we are getting the same movie with a bit of improvement in terms of jokes if you love family guy you will love its practically the same kind of humour the same kind of gags if you dont well dont even bother to buy the ticket is almost like brian john is peter griffin and samantha is lois although i rather preferred mila kuniss turn on the first one to the one amanda seyfried gives on this one i just feel like mila would have given something to the movie that amanda cant simply give despite being a very talenactress its not that mark wahlberg is one of my favourite actors but i think i d rather see him doing this type of film than the transformerss ones which i need to be honest i dont give a crap i think wahlberg has this gift to comedy movies which starsince boogie nights jessica barth is quite a surprise as tamilynn once again and as it happened on the first movie the show stealer although theres that liam neeson scene which in fact i think was the movies best was giovanni ribisi as the awkward and misfitdonny that fresh cakes line just killed me his scenes were the ones i laughed the much particularly the comic con ones i think that it was a masterstroke to place de climax of the film on this convention because it allowed to some notably funny gags regarding the so called geeks just like the first is cameo heavy from liam neeson to tom brady passing by sam j jones who had already appeared on the first one the liam neeson one was notably brilliant in a satire to the more recent roles of the irish actor is an enjoyable flick with the virtues and flaws that you would expect of a summer blockbuster just for laughs and the popcorns,comedy
a few laughs throughout but nothing that had the whole cinema burst out laughing watching this film i felt as if theyre were two sides to it the first side being legal aspect very few laughs were present in this side of the film and in parts it seemed more like a social commentary on current legal human rights the second side of the film was the off plot cheap laughs these were funny but seemed completely irrelevant to the main storyhonestly this movie isnt laugh out loud funny really i can pretty much guarantee youd laugh more when watching jurassic world or avengers 2 rather than watching this film510 on a good day,comedy
i saw starring mark wahlberglone survivor the perfect storm the voice of seth macfarlanea million ways to die in the west tooth fairy amanda seyfrieda million ways to die in the west jennifers body jessica barthget smart2008 next and giovanni ribisia million ways to die in the west avatarthis is the sequel to the 2012 in case you could not tell by the number 2 in the title most of the original actors return except mila kunis and it is explained why she is not in the picture the movie opens with sethand jessica getting married its not long before they start having marital problemsjust like everybody else in the whole wide world doesand they decide to have a baby because as everyone knows that always solves the problem but seth being a teddy bear well he has no genitalia their only options are to adopt or use a sperm donor and thats when things get complicaseth has to go to court to prove he is a person or his status would be that he is considered just ordinary property his old thunder buddy for life mark helps by getting amanda an inexperienced lawyer to fight for seth and jessica giovanni shows up hoping that seth loses in court so that he can use seth in his own personal schemes there is a scene involving the ny comic con that should bring a tingle to any nerds out thereme included there are several good cameos i remember seeing liam neesom jay leno and tom brady just to mention a few fyi there is a scene after the end credits that includes one of the three cameos that i just mentioned its rar for language drug use and sexual contentincluding nudity and has a running time of 1 hour  55 minutes if you liked the first one then you should enjoy this one in fact i laughed a lot and i think this one is better i would buy it on bluray,comedy
i gave it a 5 because i managed to watch it the entire way through but wow this was a struggleso the movie starts off slow enough but most of the jokes were just extremely tasteless and the flow of the movie made no sense for the first hour or so of the film it was mostly one bad line after another with every one ending on a black dick joke i will say the opening was pretty cool to watch im guessing they just forgot to add a bit of comedy after that till about halfway through the movie even the stuff in the previews made me laugh harder than anything because of how they presenit and i think thats where this movie dropped the ball in many cases i was making a face going wait that made no sense and thats never a good signnear the end of the movie however the storyline actually picks up and its not half bad at all i think they just went a bit overboard with some of the comedy scenes the cameos they included were great and for the most part i like seeing movies having fun and experimenting with public perception that poke fun at the stereotype to create a laugh i wish more comedy movies would do this not only does it help boost a movie that might be dry in some scenes but adds some light hearfun to an othewise try to hard presentation i can tell you in all honesty if you see this in the theatre you will be wasting your money if you wait till you can watch it at home or on netflix it will be a good way to waste a portion of your day,comedy
oh my god my jaws are literally sore after watching this film it was extremely upliftingi think seth macfarlane always has these rough and bright ideas to make brilliant films like this i really liked the first movie of and i really liked the sequel tooat the beginning of the film when we hear old beat music and dancing with the ladies  gents it really reminded me of family guy plus macfarlanes love of frank sinatralike music i felt like joining the crowd like seriouslyi was so so relieved that mark walbergs character didnt die otherwise the film would be screwed on having him just be killed off however thank god it didnt happen the way i thoughti would really hope they make a third film because is awesome,comedy
was more than expecthe character of seth macfarlane is always funny family guy and for two hours movie a few moments passed without laughing other than that it was hilarious i missed most of the movie while i was laughing what is funny about the statements he says in the incorrect time in what made me laugh most is when donny holds him and starts running but what cares about at that time is the voice of the fat kid running this is what is funny about tednow i will be waiting for and other movies from the voice of seth macfarlane,comedy
the original was the equivalent of lightning in a bottle  at the time it seemed like something nobody had ever seen before only seth macfarlane could have come up with a hilarious and bizarre story about an average joe and his magical talking teddybear who remained his only friend since childhood the movie became a huge success for both universal and macfarlane making over halfabillion at the global boxoffice and both fell in love with the idea of fasttracking its sequelso now we have and how does it hold up the reason why the first one did so well was because of its novelty as ive already mentioned most people had never seen such a thing before  and were probably hungering for original comediesunfortunately now that the novelty has worn off at least for me failed to charm me the overall experience just wasnt the same for me whilst watching the first and just before this movie too ill admit though  there were still plenty of moments when i laughed with the audiencethe reason why a lot of the jokes failed for me was because they were just nonsensical if anyone is familiar with macfarlanes sense of humour or or family guy then theyll most likely be in my position of knowing what to expect another reason why the jokes failed was because they replicathe cutaway segments seen in family guy the first few are pretty funny but they eventually get annoying and even start to distract from the main plotjokes aside i have to say that i also really like the direction macfarlane and his writing partners took the story even though there are points in this movie that play out the same way as the first movie the overall plot is different in both style and theme while the first movie explores what it means to be you in front of others you love and care for this movie explores current issues with human rights these themes at the very least actually gives these movies some much neededdepththe love story between john and and samantha feels really forced ill be honest  even though im disappoinyes disappointhat mila kunis is gone i still have to say that amanda seyfried did an okay job playing the romantic interest of our newly divorce she just does a much better job playing a lawyerdespite these positive points still pales in comparison with other comedies that have come out this year namely spy itll make for a great rainyday watch,comedy
definitely a step backwards from the first one and definitely a step backwards from the seth macfarlane standard of comedy a million ways to die in the west not withstanding i definitely hoped for much more yet still i managed to leave with a slight smile on my facewhat starts out as a strong comedy with the jokes we love from macfarlanes comedy slowly turns into a a pathetic watch ending on a low note close to a commercial it really looks like around half of the movie someone just said fck it and left a computer directing in the second half all we get or a couple of mild laughs and that would be cool had it not been filled with multiple attempts at drama i was in the cinema asking myself why the hell is this going on in a movie really there was so much occupied by totally serious monologues or dialogues that not only never paid of in a joke but also had the most generic and i mean it dialogue and direction they were scenes of an unbearable badness they seemed to have been put together by a program thats how generic they were plus the jokes that connecthese scenes were cringeworthy another negative unfortunately has to be giovanni ribisi i have always been a supporter of his but be it the dialogue the type of jokes he is given or his over emphasized performance he never got a laugh out of me unlike the first tedfor a movie that seems to have so few effort put into it its actually surprising how good it turn out the first half has really strong moments of comedy some great original and expecjokes that really pay off and promise a better final result i laughed really hard there and some of the scenes really had extreme situations that were exhilarating to watch as much as they were disgusting also works again on all levels you really feel like he is there and it is not something granwhen talking cgi characters yet all the actors make it feel authentic and the cgi is absolutely flawless basically thinking back at it i am just fascinaat how much i was enjoying myself until it starnot giving a crap and not only it stopped being funny but also it starbeing hateworthy and i it really bugs me this is not a good comedy overall by many standards yet it isnt the trainwreck it could have really risked being there are great jokes but again i just cant help but be disappoinby what the movie ended up doing,comedy
i am from bosnia and herzegovina repoblic of srpska south east europe watched tonight great movie even better than first rude jokes seth crashed american legal system lawyers facebook google hollywood consumerismamerican hystory of slaves civil rights a lot of toillet and sex humor i really enjoyed also seth talked about new generations new generations dont know differences between star wars and star trek who is rocky etc there is no mila kunis she is sacked in first line of movie johnny just said that they have been divorced but instead of her there is marvelous amanda who thake huge part in this fantastic movie mark standard very good must see bye,comedy
for all the actors in this movie who did cameos i thought it would be good but it was a real loserevery other word was the f word and every word in front of the f word was motherthe story line sucked and the bear even though had great potential to be funny with the writing in this movie also suckedthe worst thing is i paid 35 dollars for 2 tickets at my favorite movie house i would have thought they had more class then to show garbage like thisterrible movie worst i have seen in among time,comedy
the thing about is that as soon as that teddy bear opens his mouth the first thought that comes into my mind is peter griffin which is not surprising considering macfarlane does the voices for both characters anyway since i quite enjoyed the first movie when i discovered that he had made a sequel i knew that it was one of those films that was going to give me some good laughs and i must say that it certainly didnt disappoint okay it is basically more of the same but then sometimes doing what one does best is the only way to go and having been a fan of family guy i pretty much knew what i was going to expectonce again we have a flow of big name stars making appearances including liam neeson in his taken role coming into the grocery store to buy a packet of childrens cereal but making sure nobody actually knows that he is buying it while i thought that was quite amusing the one scene that simply sticks in my mind was when they went into the lawyers office and the lawyer pulls out a bong and starts smoking it puts it down and says i hope you dont mind that was so absurd that i simply cannot believe it ever happening but the fact that it did makes me give this movie the stars that it deserves anyway i feel that i might end up giving away too many of the jokes so i will simply say help me home and if you are wondering what i mean by that then go an see the movie and you will understandanyway gets married but it turns out that after about six months i believe they are starting to have problems so it is suggesthat they have a child unfortunately just doesnt have the equipment and his wife having been a coke fiend cant have children so they decide to adopt unfortunately the state decides that isnt actually a human he is property so he cant adopt which results in him being stripped of all of his rights which is why he lands up in a lawyers office  he wants his rights back and wants to be considered a sentient human like everybody elseanyway i dont really want to go much deeper than that because while there is the idea about being considered a human and the still simmering issue of race in america this film is basically all about having a laugh at a couple of really obnoxious and dope smoking losers though i must admit that whalberg does a brilliant job in this film  as he did in the last i still cant believe that this was the guy who was the lead singer of marky mark and the funky bunch along with the laughs the film does force you to think about the issue of race and the fact that not too long ago the same argument was being made about the status of the african american,comedy
after the good boxoffice performance of this sequel was already predictable it is especially recommended to those who liked the first film and especially advised against all people whose good sense and good taste preventhem from properly enjoying it the film brings nothing new just continuing the story of the obscene and rude teddy bear that shone in the initial film unfortunately the manners and behavior of the creature have in no way improved continuing to be the perfect mirror of a generation of teenagers with no prospects of life no education no manners and obsessed with everything that has to do with sex alcohol or induce hallucinogenic states the film is supposed to be a comedy but viewed from this perspective it takes on tragic and deeply unhappy contours but im not surprised i was not expecting seth macfarlane a man who likes to make movies and serials with offensive and provocative humor had suddenly turned into an amish or something like that but i remain in doubt whether the art of cinema needed another junkfilm for its vast collection in any case the film has an advantage the only one as a social critic it allows us all to think whether we want to be equal or better than that bear and allows me and others like me to write texts like this,comedy
why did the lovely amanda seyfried get involved in this crass stuff never saw the first one but because it was so popular picked up this dvd about 10 minutes into the movie i had to ask myselfwhen do i laugh it just wasnt funnyin my opinion anyway it just tried to shock and it didnt do that to me either i lie i did chuckle at least twice amanda please find another agent i mean the whole idea of a talking teddy is nonsense so why involve serious issues like acknowledging minorities etc and how obvious was that morgan freeman cameo i doubt he was ever within 1000 miles of the furry hero when his scene was shot,comedy
the next instalment on the big screen of the foulmouthed furry fiends battle in human society has everything i expeccracking out the random jokes crude humour wonderfully scripcameos classic flashback scenarios and bad language to go along with stupiditylook the film is pretty much the same concept as the original and doesnt have anything particularly new but if you enjoyed why would you want anything so if youre into family guy loved the first and had a laugh with a million ways to die in the west like i did itll give you the laugh out loud moments you desire i wasnt personally in as many heart creasing stitches as the original or a million ways however some high pitch squeals a couple of snorts a few grunts and film long smile made for a great trip to the moviesits nothing special or new so cant rate any higher but does what it says on the tin go watch fans of macfarlane,comedy
i have previously reporbefore that writing comedy is difficult as it relies on two principles that all comedy is based on misery and that it needs to remain unpredictable its hard for comics especially for long running comics on comedy central or even the monty python trope to remain unpredictable because they tend to stick with the methods that work best for a laugh and if you watch something like the three stooges or monty python long enough youll definitely notice a pattern when the joke starts to remain repetitive the best thing to do is to fold the act and try something else more unexpecthat an audience would have not seen coming seth macfarlane is one comic whose currently is the state of finding a new voice while working with an old one a million ways to die in the west didnt respond well with audiences tanking at the box office while on television fans of family guy and american dad have nothat the neither show was as funny as it used to be i too have found that family guy has become tired and repetitive in stories since he did well with back in 2012 it only made sense to have another go around with the foulmouthed teddy bear in the movie opens with the wedding of played by seth macfarlane and his girlfriend from the first movie tamilynn things are looking good for this teddy bear but his best friend john bennett played by mark wahlberg is down in the dumps after being divorced from lori six months ago tries to get john to meet up with more woman but the guy is too depressed to date again months go by and the relationship between and tamilynn has become sour up to the point where they end up arguing in their apartment gets the idea that having a baby would be a good way to save the marriage after two sperm donations are botched they find out that tami cannot conceive children they resort to adopting but they are denied as the unistates government does not recognized as human this ends up canceling out the marriage and causes to loose many of his civil rights to prove he is human he and john decide to take the case to court where a young lawyer samantha l jackson played by amanda seyfried represents themthe first thing that does right is that it doesnt retread the same story from before they couldnt have anyway as the first movie had a very sitcomish feel but was fine the way it was what is retreaded are the fearless jokes from macfarlane that are more hit and miss this time i do recall laughing at the first half hour more then the rest of the movie because macfarlane wants to get in as many laughs as possible he relies way too heavily on jokes that are cutaway gags or simply references to movies from the eighties what i will say is that the actors delivering the comedy are sure trying their hardest mark wahlberg and seth macfarlane still have great chemistry as if theyve been friends for a long time amanda seyfried does well as the young lawyer and new love interest for john but this is where my biggest problem lies the story of revolved around john and lori getting together and working around the fact that decided to leave the first love interest out is kind of disheartening ill give this six bears out of ten i see this sequel as a mixed bag but those going in will either like or hate macfarlanes sense of humor id say watch and family guy before committing to seeing this sequel just dont expect to laugh as hard but i did laugh,comedy
there are films that you just cant wait to be over then there are films that enjoyable but youre still happy for them to finish and finally there are films that you could happily have go on for days on end this is a rare case of the latter especially in the form of a sequel is it better than the original thats a hard question to answer because both are absolutely hilarious throughout and to separate two films based purely on how much you laughed is a tough thing to do thats the beauty of anything with seth macfarlanes name on it his sole objective is just to make you have a good time it just so happens hes good enough at filmmaking to actually make a pretty decent film at the same timethe two hour runtime just flies by theres only perhaps two dull scenes and both are forgivable as theyre purely setting up crucial plot points aside from that every scene is a riot the cameos are plentiful the cast on paper is actually quite stunning when you consider some of the names they managed to get  a sure sign that people simply want to work with macfarlane and all are given brilliant material to work with liam neesons was probably the best of the bunch for me followed closely by tom bradys having no mila kunis doesnt overly hurt the film as amanda seyfried does a great job replacing her in the lead female role mark wahlberg is back thankfully and his chemistry with is equally as good as the first there really isnt any negatives i can think of which is a pretty amazing thing to say if you enjoyed the first youll love this one too if you didnt like the first well to borrow a line from peter griffin chances are i do not care for you as a person and you can probably go ahead and ignore everything written in this review,comedy
while i wouldnt exactly call seth macfarlanes liveaction debut 2012 a pleasant surprise it was still slightly better than i expecit took a relatively original idea built it around the story of a man who refused to grow up and delivered a few laughs along the way the films boxoffice success cementhe need for a sequel and the original idea was to have voiced by mcfarlane in a thick boston accent and best friend john mark wahlberg road trip across america with a van full of weed but when they realised this was the story of were the millers 2013 the plan had to changeinstead of the road trip we are given a halfbaked and borderline offensive civil rights allegory which never settles on how and when it should get to the point with john now divorced from mila kuniss character from the first movie he cannot help but feel lonely as he watches his friend marry his girlfriend tamilynn jessica barth soon into the marriage they are bickering like an old couple and decide that the only way to repair things is to have a baby however due to the fact that lacks reproductive organs they opt for a sperm donor with sam j jones running low and a failed attempt to steal nfl star tom bradys seemingly sacred juice along with the discovery that tamilynns years of drug abuse have left her infertile they choose instead to adoptit is at this point that is flagged by the government having previously ducking under their radar declared an item of property as opposed to an actual person has his marriage annulled loses his job and has every legal right he thought he once had taken from him seeking legal aid and john turn to rookie lawyer samantha l jackson amanda seyfried a fellow pothead who agrees to work the case pro bono meanwhile nemesis donny giovanni ribisi now working as a janitor for manufacturer hasbro looks to exploit this opening the law and convinces his boss tom jessup john carroll lynch to let him steal back in order to open him up and see how he works with the hope of making a fortune in allowing every child to own their own tedthe main problem with is that the comedy just seems off often seeking to simply outgross anything that came before like the wave of comedies that hit the big screen in the wake of theres something about marys success in the late 90s and early 2000s the film is also peppered with popculture references with the running joke that samantha l jackson doesnt even know who samuel l jackson is conversations are often so vulgar that its difficult to feel sympathy for who is voiced without any trace of charm or cuteness by macfarlane at almost two hours it also drags dipping in and out of the main plot thread without any care for narrative flow i did laugh during  a cameo from jay leno and a jurassic park nod in particular  but this is a messy often outright unfunny experience,comedy
someone said that is the opposite of the first one had 80 good jokes and 20 bad ones this movie is 20 good80 bad endless musical opening with dancers and stuff endless boring song in the middle of the movie yeah i dont like the musical bits  if youre not from the usa youre going to miss many local pop culture references someone has to realize how awkward usas references sound abroad nobody knows if you have to laugh anyways or just bite your lip you can let pass a few while watching the simpsons and family guy but on a movie jeez too much swearing like unnecessary swearing and too much drugs might sound cool if youre a teenager but its way too immature for an adult audience,comedy
mark wahlberg and his little stuffed buddy had themselves quite a box office hit in 2012 but for me was quite a let downthe chemistry between wahlberg and the teddy bear is still there to be sure but i was really put off by the cavalier and irreverent attitude toward drug use having recently lost someone this past year to a heroin overdose i saw very little humor in wahlberg and the bear toking upa whole lot of people who ought to know better really embarrassed themselves with some of the guest star roles really morgan freeman your eloquence was washerethe plot was completely ripped off from a star trek tng episode where captain picard has to defend datas status with starfleet was he property as an android or had he developed the self awareness or a soul if you will of a person that might have been the basis for a nice fantasy film instead of going for howard stern like humor,comedy
the first was a major surprise for me i thought it looked stupid from the trailers but when i saw it i couldnt stop laughing having been a fan of family guy for a long time i was not sure what to make of seth macfarlanes feature film debut it was a success so a sequel was bound to happen at some pointwhen i first walked into i wasnt sure what to expect would it be funnier than the original or just a waste of time well it was actually neither what it is though is a subtle commentary on civil rightsin the film voice by seth macfarlane is seen by the us government as nothing more than a piece of property with the help of his thunder buddy john mark wahlberg and a young lawyer named sam amanda seyfried goes to court to fight for his rights as a human being this is the main plot point but there are a few subplots thrown in such as finding a sperm donor so and his wife tami can have a baby and a return by creepy bearophile donny giovanni rabisi i did not find myself laughing quite as much in this one as with the first some of the jokes were a bit predictable this time around and some even seemed forced probably the highlight of the humor is a hysterical cameo which i will not divulgebottom line it has a good message to it if you like films with a moral but if youre a fan of seth macfarlane who is hoping for nothing but nonstop laughs then you may be a tad disappoinoverall i enjoyed it but id say its more worth a rental when the time comes not really anything to rush to the cinema for,comedy
i came to laugh and laugh i did is a ridiculously stupid movie the thing is when seth macfarlane directs it i like it more than the average dumb guy movie i was gutbusting more times than i expecto was it as inspired and heartfelt as the first of course not it wouldve benefiif it was but there is only so much you could squeeze out of a potsmoking bear without getting more of the same lots of fuzz the story is predictable yes yet it stays away from being too serious which i applaud macfarlane for doing this time around he divulged in some really hacky melodrama in a million ways to die in the west and i prayed that it didnt happen here luckily he doubles down on the laughs however he also doubles down on the offensiveness this is a mean movie folks prepare to scoff and scowl at how low it goes some of it does work partially due to how racism and homophobia is humorously typical of a loud bostonian im not sure how anyone will feel about ferguson and charlie hebdo and robin williams death jokes the 223 year rule has never applied to seth macfarlane for him its about a 4 month rule putting aside all of the flaws i can happily say that delivers as a comedy its a vast improvement over seths last film and its making me crave third film but if they have to put the bear to bed so be it,comedy
does not start promisingly at all featuring a surprisingly flat opening narration by patrick stewart a dreadfully boring and unnecessary dance number over the opening credits and a interminably long unfunny shouting match between and his new bride the first ten minutes of are about as bad as anything in any movie of 2015 during these scenes i felt like i was about to suffer through one of the worst comedy sequels ever made luckily once those three scenes are over miraculously somehow turns itself completely around and becomes the most frequently hilarious and enjoyable comedy of the yearthe worst part of the otherwise highly entertaining first movie was the predictable and despite the presence of a swearing teddy bear bythenumbers plot the best decision made by director seth macfarlane and coscreenwriters alec sulkin and wellesley wild for the sequel is that they pretty much throw the very idea of a plot out the window sure theres a thin story about having to prove that hes a person in court but the majority of the best scenes either have little relevance to the plot or having absolutely nothing to do with the main story at all those who wanmore scenes of john mark wahlberg and just hanging out in the first movie get plenty more of that here only this time they are joined by sam l jackson amanda seyfried potsmoking fun lawyer the parts of the trio just chilling out together are the best in the whole film the highlight being the scenes in the library when they are supposedly working seyfried is much stronger and certainly more interesting than mila kunis character was in the first film most likely because her character is actually allowed to join in on the fun as opposed to being on the side for half the picture shoehorning her character into becoming johns love interest in the third act is somewhat eyerolling but it isnt prominent enough that it kills any of the films comedic momentumas can be expecin a seth macfarlane film there are plenty of celebrity cameos while these cameos easily could have been distracting and forced all of them work quite well and never slow down the runtime an early cameo by liam neeson is far more amusing than his entire role in macfarlanes 2014 dud a million ways to die in the west the expecreturning cameos of patrick warburton and sam j jones are just as funny as they were in the first film best of all is the cameo by dennis haysbert who far too often is underused when it comes to comedy morgan freeman appears in a small role though unfortunately its the films biggest missed opportunity that he isnt called upon to be all that funny that said theres really not a weak link in the entire cast everyone seems to be having a good time with the incredibly vulgar and silly nature of the filmdespite the absolutely dire opening ten minutes of the film is overall more consistently hilarious and memorable than its predecessor it is one of the rare comedy sequels that manages to improve upon its original while still offering the same main characters and basic formula i laughed way harder during than i have during every other comedy ive seen in 2015 combined recommended for those who enjoy raunchy and stupid rracomedy 810,comedy
divided most audiences some loved it some hait with few holding a middle ground is much of the same style of humour so if easily offended best skip this onethe film starts with marrying his sweetheart and supermarket coworker tamilynn jessica barth whilst john mark wahlbergs relationship with lori mila kunis from the first film who could clearly not be tempback has already hit the rocksignoring the fact that consummating the marriage is clearly going to be impossible without an appendage attempts to have children draws attention to his legal status as property rather than a person what follows is a legal battle to prove humanity with a sexy young lawyer amanda seyfried acting as both legal aid for and a rekindling of love interest for johnas often in seth macfarlane films there is a plethora of cameos some of them very funny for example the human rights lawyer needs to be a harrison ford type of lawyer and youll never guess who plays the part and no this isnt a spoiler  it wasnt my favourite cameo was by michael dorn as the strong and silent half of a gay couple if you know what role dorn is famous for and link that to where the films finale occurs then you have a dodgy costume winner of a belly laugh by the way its also worth staying through the interminable end credits for a final humorous cameomark wahlberg again proves what a good comic actor he is after his roles in the original and the underrathe other guys and the excellent giovanni ribisi friends returns in the role of the evil and jealous donny from the first film now nearer to the heart of darkness as a hasbro janitorseth macfarlanes is also a comic creation of genius that can get away with highly offensive lines by just looking cute however in my view a line does get crossed with the script a few times in terms of good taste particularly in terms of numerous black jokes that seem to come at you apace in the middle of the film offence is in the eye of the beholder and im not black so cant legitimately comment on how close to the knuckle these werethe multitalenmacfarlane again directs and this is a vast improvement on last years turgid a million ways to die in the west at 115 minutes the film doesnt outstay its welcome but could still in my opinion do with a nip and a tuck in places as examples the big hollywoodstyle dance number in the opening titles surely the first since indiana jones and the temple of doom is a bit pointless and makes look more false than in the whole of the rest of the film and a midfilm song by seyfried seems to be trying to rehash a classic campfire scene from the three amigos but rather misses the markin summary if you liked you will probably like but it has an 18r rating for a reason with extensive bad language sexual references and drug taking they move in herds  lol that may offendif you enjoyed this review please see the visual version at bobthemoviemancom and enter your email address for future reviews thanks,comedy
dont ever go by overpaid blowhard movie critics a lot of movies get rave reviews by critics and yet are lousy while good movies get bad reviews from critics youre talking about a handful of people out of millions rating a movie is hilarious  there are gags galore in this movie and it is very funny trying to prove he is a person and not property is the main plot of the movie as well as subplots of the villain from the first movie trying to kidnap again and sell him to hasbro plus more hilarity from patrick warburton and michael dorn as gay lovers throw the hijinks of the san diego comicon into the mix and your sides will be aching at all the pop culture references  definitely ignore reviews and judge it for yourself i give it a 1010 better than the first,comedy
my thoughtsseth macfarland movies are always a hard one to critique in my opinion he tries to walk that line between crass jokes and the ones that make you think and we get that in but there are times where you just go wow seth that definitely went further in one direction than the other fans of seth macfarland will understand what i am saying we either get a movie that everyone seemed to love or we get a million ways to die in the west which people seemed to not enjoyand lets face it seth is not that great of a story teller and is another example of that he rehashes some of the somethings he used in the first giovanni ribisi is pretty much doing the same story in this movie but just in another setting we also get a rehash of some of the stories he did in family guy not saying this is all bad it just shows that when he loves an idea he sticks with it and uses it multiple times seth is using the story to get to the next joke and not vice verse and that is something we can overlook as long as the jokes that are being told are worthy of it and i will say for the majority of the movie they are but there are times where the jokes do fall a little flat or you just wish they would move along in the story there is one scene where they are traveling down to new york and one of the scenes just drags i was sitting there thinking man they could have cut this scene out and it really wouldnt have hurt anythingthis seems to be the summer of cameos in movies first with entourage and now with and also for magic mike xxl review to come cameos in my opinion are not bad if they are used well and uses them well and doesnt there is a great one that happens at the grocery store that works at that just had me laughing but then there is one that happens at a convention center where at first i was like omg they got these guys to do this awesome but then they took it in a direction that i thought was stupid and really not that funny in my opinionis a fun ride with a few bumps along the road my recommendationit is a funny movie to see as long as you like the crass controversial humor,comedy
its raw humor at its bestvoiced by seth macfarlane in what i would call the brian voice if you like family guy american dad or any of his other shows you will love thisis the movie politically correct no its not and thats how movies should be your jaw will drop as you hear some of the jokes this is not for the easily offended and yes you will be fully entertainedthe movie makes fun of big names like liam neeson  trix are for kids  tom brady  no you are not a cheater and the quest of his magic essence and even jay leno  asking for favors in a bathroom and even pokes at gays slaves other tv shows and moviesyoull be craving for a part 3,comedy
seriously when are comedy sequels ever better than the original if youd count lethal weapon 2 as a comedy then that might be the exception but since its not the streak remains that said this film cracked me up from beginning to end though some jokes didnt work and some were only funny the first 2 of 10 times  seen a black cock lately  and the movie was far too long for the majority it worked as an excellent supplement to the original which ill always laugh out loud with and the human rights plot  how perfectly it fit with the release date june 26 2015the same day the supreme court ruled in favor of human rights to gays and lesbians and marriage well played well played   final thoughts of course two different couples brought their 48 year olds into see this movie egad liam neeson said it best well summed up trix are for kids is for adults you idiots,comedy
hilarious just like the other one as promised has grown up is married and wanting to settle down and have a family problem is hes not a person but a thing cue a law and order style civil rights suit in the courtroom rude crude disgusting in places witty and with so many nods to other films and homages the jurassic park scene is brilliant macfarlane gives heart to the wonderful bear and the chemistry between the goofy wahlberg and is lovely ribisi returns as the dodgy tiffanyfetish badguy again and freeman is suave in his gravitas role but still brings some smiles the sfx for are flawless  and hes so believable for an adult version of the childrens film  a living teddy bear  its got depth character and charm as well as many many headacheinducing laughs our cinema clapped on a few occasions lots of fbombs general bad language drug use and sexual referenceinnuendo not for everyone but a feel good if a smidge formulaic uplifting romp,comedy
ok so its seth macfarlane seen one sethif you liked this is for you if you didnt see or like give a try it meets all of requirements of an r racomedy it has plenty of bad language and sex or body part jokes best thing about the movie is it deliveries laughs except for a couple of lulls it is extremely funny there is a bit too much drug use but the bong gets funny the movie is not be in good taste but it is funnyperhaps it steps over the line with a nine eleven joke but a teddy bear can get away with it there are fun cameos and a lot of the cast from seths recent western perhaps the lesson is macfarlane should be heard and not seenthere is an after credits seen that is good for one more laugh a good comedy benefits from an audience experience see this in a theater,comedy
is the continuation of the talking teddy bear played by seth macfarlane and mark whalberg in this movie tries to prove that he is a living person and not just a talking teddy bear the first was alright it featured inventive new humour but it wasnt the best comedy ever nether so i was somewhat skeptical going into this movie because generally sequels get worst as they go especially in franchises like this this movie is bad it wasnt nearly as good as the first one and featured stupid jokes that didnt even work most of the time and that just fell flat the only good parts where the cameos it is a cheap rehash of the original that is really dumb and not funny do not waste your precious time on this movie and save your money for something else i promise you that this movie is not worth it watch plaintrains and automobiles a movie that is referenced in you will certainly have a better time,comedy
i had high hopes for this movieno pun intended wellerrrr i really did intend for that first sentence to be funny just like i am sure seth mcfarlane intended for this movie to be a laugh riot most of the jokes fall flat and there were a lot quiet moments during the matine i went toto be completely honest i did laugh out loud at least four or five times and i chuckled several more times i liked all of the characters i enjoyed the movie my advice is to get a little bent before you see this movie if you see it in a packed theatre i am sure there will be more laughter throughout the showing some movies are better experienced with many other people watching i think this movie was conceived with this in mindnot a bad movie i do not give it a thumbs up but i dont give it a thumbs down either it would have been better with better jokes,comedy
when i found out there was going to be a i was really excifor it as the first one was really funny i found to be really funny the jokes were improved from the first moviei still find that the storyline the plot was still very weak and needs to improve if they do another movie i found that this movie was really funny at the start then in the middle it was a bit slow and they put scenes in when it wasnt necessary and the ending was funny againapart from that it was really funny with good actorsactresses with improved dialogue i give it a 810 as the storyline was still a bit pooralso this movie has the same humour as family guy so if you like the show you will love but if you dont like family guy dont see it your wasting your money i wouldnt recommend to take kids to see it either because of the language they use in the film,comedy
when i sat in to see this movie i had little expectations for it due to the rising number of bad sequels to good movies however i was greewith a happy surprise only 5 minutes in the movie as it turned out to be a hilariously set totally immature little story for the crowddue to the fact that the humor in this movie is mostly immature and childish as most would call it some people will not like it as much as those who appreciate the art of making a immature humor actually enjoyable however i suspect the majority of viewers will be more than satisfied with the quality of the humor no matter the stylethe story follows a legal issue and johnny encounter and their adventure of getting through it the acting was perfect from mark wahlberg and amanda seyfried as they allowed their characters to be as realistic as real gets in a world where magic teddy bears exist seth macfarlanes voice acting is also great he expressed emotions through just voicing him flawlessly cgi was also great considering he is a plush teddy bear most other actors in the movie also did a great job only jessica barth seemed like she could have done better never the less i think the movie was acout perfectlyseth macfarlanes direction was well suifor a movie such as this the camera angles 90 of the time were great the lighting and choreography of the actorsactresses were well doneoverall id rate this movie an 810 it is definitely a movie you will love if you appreciate such humor word of advice though dont take your kids to this movie as it does contain strong language im only giving the movie an 8 out of 10 because there were some parts where unnecessary content was placed that contribuneither to the story nor the theme but aside from those 23 scenes the movie in itself was perfect i highly recommend this movie if youre looking for a good laugh for an hour and a half,comedy
is funny at times but theres not enough humor to compensate for the numerous flaws of the movie if you liked the first youll definitely laugh at this film a few times but the movie has far too many jokes that fail for long stretches many of the jokes that fail are reiteramultiple times and some of the other jokes are just plain not funny another aspect is that so much of is spent either talking about or copying other movies that very little of it is actually original it goes without saying the films not very intelligent despite its moments and that illustrates the most obvious flaw of this film the film is tonally and narratively erratic one moment the films silly the next its really dark and the plot runs like an extended episode of family guy so in essence the film is funny but only for spurts and during the spurts when the films not funny the film is all over the place,comedy
in 2012 family guy creator seth macfarlane introduced the world to a talking teddy bear people thought he was crazy but the vulgar bear quickly gained a cult following and was a rousing success the first film was really nothing more than an introduction to that showed just how extreme a talking teddy bear could be but it lacked a real story line and the jokes quickly got old that however is not the case with the sequel in the newlywed bear is not getting along with his wife to save the marriage they do what many couple do and decide to have a baby after failing to obtain celebrity sperm and tamilynn decide to adopt but the state has other ideas as they determine cant adopbecause hes not a person he is property from their has to use every means at his disposal to prove hes a real person this sequel has an interesting story and seth macfarlane finally decided to play on his strengths in regards to a film instead of these long drawn out jokes that seven people in the world get he utilizes cutaways the same way he does on family guy and it really makes a difference half way through the first i was bored of it already but is genuinely funny and can hold your interest throughout this is the kind of film i always expecto see from seth macfarlane and even people who hathe first film will not be disappoinis certainly a unique character but when hes portrayed in the proper setting he becomes exactly what he was originally intended to be hilarious,comedy
in we rejoin john mark wahlburg and his foul mouth pot smoking fast talking lovable teddy bear voiced by seth mcfarland in this misadventure has recently married girlfriend tamilynn jessica barth and quickly they realize that their relationship is not exactly better for it in an attempt to rekindle the flame they try unsuccessfully to have a child when that doesnt work a trip to the adoption agency raises a red flag with the government is not considered human but in fact property and thereby unable to be officially wed or hold down employment and john then meet samantha amanda syfried a fledgling attorney who tries to help them argue in court rights as a human being in the eyes of the law i have been a longtime fan of seth mcfarland the looks the voice the comedy the acting is there anything that guy cant do although in recent years i have found myself avoiding family guy never could get into american dad or the cleveland show something about the format has become a little stale i enjoyed a million ways to die in the west 2013 a great deal and was disappointo see it was not very well received by critics and audiences alike the original i thought was hilarious it was exactly what i expecrandom comedy bits in the loosely held confines of a plot much like you get with any family guy episode so when was announced i expecmuch of the same only from the very first few minutes of this movie i felt something had changed much in the way new episodes of family guy feel the routine has grown slightly stale in the opening wedding scene patrick warburton reprises his role as guy an almost selfloathing macho homosexual used as a platform for some very weak offensive for the sake of being funny gay jokes then there is a very elaborate busby berkley style dance number for the opening credits what is that an attempt to gloss over the offense taken with a musical number in the wake of the recent supreme court decision it seems very ill timed for that matter the rest of the storyline of fighting for his right to legally be considered human and thereby marry his girlfriend seems almost a too close for comfort play on recent news i think since the plot is a distant second to the gags in this series another plot might have been more effective with all that being said is not without its hilarious low brow comedy bits this movie nails several great ones for its target audience there are pop culture movie references to tickle any level of fan boy or girls fancy there is a planes trains and automobiles 1987 bit that had me rolling out of my seat at one point in the movie the action brings our protagonists to a comiccon in new york a seth mcfarland narrative at a comiccon is like jerry seinfeld doing a movie in an airport or jim gaffigan at a grocery store its all too easy for him to create jokes that pander to the nostalgia of his target audience the movie itself is worth a watch for the few good laughs it creates i hardly recommend spending theater money to see it set a look out for this on demand or on netflix unless youre the kind of person who is still watching family guy reruns if thats the case i suggest you put in your retainer pause the world of warcraft and ask your mom to drive you to the nearest cineplex before its gone if you enjoyed this review please comment or check out my other reviews at yourturntopickcom,comedy
i just love the dance numbers did in his wedding at the very beginning of the movie it surely paid the tributes to those 40s and 50s hollywood movies with group dances by dressed gentlemen and ladies doing amazing foot work it went so smooth with being the lead dancer it was quite an unexpecand fresh move in the movie also i appreciate it referred to or made humor out of the current and as well as old pop culture though audiences who are not familiar with american pop culture especially those old pop cultures and classics movies might miss out most of the humor in the movie the movie connects well with us grownups teddy bear is generally childrens favorite and this teddy bear is even cooler because it does grow up and even fools around with his best friend it is definitely an entertaining movie and a movie about love and friendship,comedy
seth macfarlene continues to tell a formulaic story maintaining the offensive disgusting and ridiculous style of fun from the first but choosing to legalise as the main plot has drastically reduced the opportunity to present more jokes in a creative way causing the film turns out to be slightly long and less funny however the story progresses in an organised structure allowing plenty characters development with some surprise cameos appearance  liam neeson jimmy kimmel and morgan freeman the expression and movement of cgi creais still perfectly crafjust like he is truly exist as in first film the chemistry between wahlberg and is still strong but the romance in between other characters is rather weak the performance of all the main casts are good even the new comer amanda seyfried just fits well as part of the film without much difference from its predecessor the sequel might not offer any fresh theme but its lightheartedly fun and surprisingly emotional ending is still worth to enjoy at the big screens,comedy
the sequel of the successful debut of seth mcfarlane director produced by media rights and universal pictures which aims to dominate the box office in the summer after the success of jurassic world  to immediately put the record straight those who loved the first and appreciates the bad comedy of griffin also love this second episodealso for the wayward bear is time to settle down after celebrating the wedding with his girlfriendtamie lynn however the odd couple must now face the harsh difficulties and compromises needed to run their own wedding despite some initial violent confrontations however they decide to start a family to pay more their union i demand refund of my ticket money or the time i spent in watching it,comedy
i was pleasantly surprised by the scope of this film while the plot doesnt do anything daring it is a bit smarter the plot has underlying themes some heart and of course shallow indecent and offensive situations while macfarlane does not do anything out of his realm here he does adult humor well and he has many smart gags lines and scenes herethe court scenes are decent but my favorite scenes here are the scenes with tom brady the scene at the sperm clinic and the scenes at comic con they were entertaining and filled with hilarityonce again while not groundbreaking it was a pleasant adult humorous escape this summer and one i may be enjoying again soon,comedy
thunder buddies for lifethe story is about and tamilynn are married and the next step is having a baby but cant be legally regarded as a parent unless he can prove his is human in a court of lawnow looking back on the first movie i got say i changed my mind on it a bit and what i mean is that it wasnt as great as i remembered it to be but i still think its decent enough to give it a pass as a comedy and a film but then i heard news about a squeal in the works and then i heard that amanda seyfried morgan freeman and liam neeson was in the film and that alone give me a little interest in the movie just by that movie news i wasnt jumping for excitement for this movie as i the movie didnt look anything special just squeal bait now after seeing im not very impressed of what i watched actually this movie is pretty bloafor its own goodwhat i liked in the first movie is the chemistry between mark wahlberg and the character they back and forward humor really worked if you would believe it i mean a pot smoking talking teddy bear hanging around with elliot moore from the happening would actually work is just beyond this world and here they chemistry is still good just like in the first moviethe movie did make me laugh a couple of times as thats mainly wahlberg and seth chemistry in the movie and some other stuff thats only a small little nod to a film or tv and it was funny at first until late on where they stretched out the joke to the point were it got really old and really stale very fast but i do think this movie is way better then seth macfarlane last movie a million way to die in the west as that movie didnt even try and was pretty forgettable i mean its been a year since that movie came out and i forgotten pretty much all of itwhat really surprise me is how messy the movie is and the movie doesnt know what it wants to be because these three different things going on in this movie like is trying to prove that hes a human because him and hes wife want a baby but needs to prove hes human so he can be legally parent yeah i know it doesnt make any sense just go for it for now oh and these a road trip in the movie and remember that stalker in the first movie that kidnapped well hes back in this movie thats the whole movie of for you oh one last thing is kind of the same as the first i wish i can go into details of that but that would be spoiling it for some people who may have interest of seeing this movie and im being nice here and wont be spoiling anythingbefore seeing this movie i thought that amanda seyfried wasnt going to do anything great i thought that she was just filling it in for the money but i got to say that she was pretty good in the movie she actually did something with the story and didnt feel like a background character she was wahlberg worked really well with each other and as well same thing with morgan freemanoverall isnt all that great to me as i said before about a billion of times by now you may disagree and like the movie and completely overall on what i said again thats fine thats cool enjoy what you enjoy but im sticking what i put down and it wont change anytime soon,comedy
with the story a jumbled mess of subplots that halfwork what saves is its momenttomoment gags the film unfortunately does reference the first film far too many times offering variations or callbacks to jokes that worked better before and even reuses a couple jokes that will feel alltoofamiliar to fans of macfarlanes family guy that being said there is still enough juice left in the characters of and john to help audiences forget the episodic structure and pointless nature of some of 2s early plot developments a handful of big stars make memorable cameos no spoilers here and the film does move at a briskenough pace to distract from the larger issues the film faces in telling its story allowing its goforbroke approach to be fun even when its not laugh outloud funnyfor the full review visit my site,comedy
2015 dir seth macfarlane  cast mark wahlberg amanda seyfried jessica barth giovanni ribisi  voice seth macfarlane disappointing sequel to the innovative crude 2012 comedy hit what really knocks the stuffings out of this tripe is the fact that john bennett played by mark wahlberg is now divorced due to mila kunis being pregnant seth macfarlane wrote her out in a method that renders everything fought for in the first film a waste teddy bear gets married to the hick mannered tamilynn in an effective opening they eventually fall into routine and start fighting until suggest they have a baby all is fine until needs a donor sam jones passes and attempting to masturbate tom brady in his sleep is met with disaster john offers to donate which leads to a scene at the clinic where he ends up dosed in semen a civil rights theme surfaces where is viewed as property as oppose to a person this costs him his job and possibly his marriage leading to a lousy road trip and a predictable conclusion while is an effective comedic creation voiced by macfarlane the payoff is far from funny wahlberg still holds strong standing by through this trial amanda seyfried as their lawyer and romantic interest to bennett is a complete waste and a reminder why viewers will miss kunis jessica barth as tamilynn is thankfully given more to do as she stands by her bear giovanni ribisi returns as a janitor for a toy company this is the most unnecessary character in the entire film while the civil rights theme is strong its laughs are far and few leaving audiences with nothing but stuffing score 5   10,comedy
his certainly not a cuddly teddy thats for all but after one seriously successful first outing in 2012 it was always a given that everyones the only one favourite foul mouthed yet somehow endearing talking bear was going to make it back to a big screen close by and with that we now have 2after his biggest misfire yet in the potentially hilarious yet wrongly skewed a million ways to die in the west of which an alumni of makes a great cameo in this film seth macfarlane finds himself back on familiar ground which is in both a material sense a comedic sense and also a still unfortunately selfindulgent directional sense that sees macfarlane struggle to rid his 2 hour plus film of jokes that dont work and plot lines that feel like nothing more than time fillers if there was ever a director in need of someone to cull his films of material that neither enhance or contribute to the tale at hand its macfarlane but to say the man doesnt deliver some comedic gold in this enjoyable romp would be a liewhile youll often find yourself ashamed at what brings forth fits of laughter here macfarlane as he is well known to do mixes juvenile humour with far more wide reaching topical funnies from everything from civil rights through to his usual pop culture insights nothing is out of his reach within the films bloaruntime there are moments of pure gold that make succeed to the level it does much like its predecessor and with the continued chemistry shared between whalbergs wellmeaning yet daft john and the macfarlane voiced clubberlang yes now has a last name at the same high levels the films many sins can be forgiven thanks to their often game saving banters the addition of amanda seyfried is also a bonus to the film her willingness to poke fun at herself a particular highlightthe narrative of is anything but fantastic and the reappearance of giovani ribisis teddy obsessed villain donny is almost a movie breaker but has enough wit and chemistry to save itself from all the low denominator humour and awkwardly edigrove that surrounds it and in the end provides some very decent comedic entertainment in saying this it may be time for all involved to move onto other things with macfarlane in particular in need of something a little meatier than he has been dishing up over the last few years3 tom brady home invasions out of 5,comedy
when i saw they were coming up with a sequel for i was well not exactly looking forward to more of the raunchiness and overblown use of expletives here they keep things colorful but manage to infuse some deeper thoughts and emotions to give it a stronger heart and the results are successfulopening with wedding and the absurdity behind such a relationship macfarlane throws in a magnificent reminder of what cinema can be with a musical number that explodes with creativity and is a great tribute to some of cinemas golden days berkeley is back in full color and its a lot of fun from that moment on we know si going beyond constant sexual references and this time we will be dealing with the problems with being rejecbeing an outsider feeling disrespecand most importantly trealike an objectthere are references to contemporary issues all the times and the fun thing in the movie is that challenges the audience to use both their brains and their hearts without forgetting whose dialogue is used to convey these ideas and company are not delicate and they love booze drugs and trashy comebacks its that this time theyre not the spotlight its not a cute transformation just a softer incarnation of what the characters have been yes there is stupidity but its not overwhelming like it was in the original instead it is used in layers and within references to other classic films characters and important political issues yes there are offensive words but there is a stronger heart herewe have attorneys of all types and we see how each kind is well not perfect and that makes the movie fun and even a reference to freemans voice reminds us how wonderful an asset to cinema for the last 30 years we can also see some stabs at pop culture throughout their visit to the comic convention which reminds us of how fickle a civilization is and how we take so much for grantedmight be stuffed animal that came to life through love and though he learned some subversive and impolite manners along the way he has a strong bond to those he loves and respects hes more of a human than some of the characters in the audience and this time his message is mirroring contemporary situations and some people might not be comfortable with the idea its funny how love even with perspective can conquer it all and still wink at us while it happensits not a perfect movie but a sure improvement over the original im still amazed at how real his expressions are i have seen oscar winning actors who cant even come close to showing emotions the way this bear did,comedy
tits film was clearly acash grab couldve been great with less schmazly scenes and better jokes akin to the first movie and many mcfarlane projects spoiler where they discover weed farm was over gratuitous and extremely disrepectful to john williams jurassic park music better luck on next film seth i really enjoyed million ways in the v west abs if course the original is classic hopefully your talents will shine through on an original project best of luck on your future endeavors spoiler next looks like son of could be funny if well done more jokes and less schmalz keep hiring the amazingly talenwalter murphy to do the score,comedy
three and a half stars out of fivesequel to the 2012 hit comedy flick about a kids teddy bear that comes to life and never leaves his side well into the childs adulthood this sequel finds the two best friends in relationship trouble as also must prove hes a person in court in order to adopt a child the film was once again direcand cowritten by seth macfarlane macfarlane also costars in the movie as the voice of the teddy bear once again he wrote the script with alec sulkin and wellesley wild the same trio also wrote the original a million ways to die in the west and multiple episodes of family guy mark wahlberg giovanni ribisi jessica barth patrick warburton and sam j jones all reprise their roles from the original film as well theyre joined this time around by amanda seyfried morgan freeman and michael dorn the film isnt nearly as consistently funny as the original but it does have a few really good laughs as the movie opens is marrying his girlfriend tamilynn barth john wahlberg has been depressed and addicto porn ever since he divorced lori six months earlier and tamilynn start having relationship drama as well and thinks that if the two have a baby it will solve all of their problems after john agrees to donate sperm for the pregnancy due to the fact that has no penis tamilynn also learns shes infertile the two decide to adopt when they learn that is still considered property in the eyes of the law and therefore he cant legally be a father or a husband they hire a lawyer named samantha leslie jackson seyfried to prove a person in courtive mostly been impressed with macfarlanes movies so far i like the original a lot and i even enjoyed a million ways to die in the west i think family guy is really hitandmiss but i am a mild fan of that show as well i also thought macfarlane did an awesome job hosting the oscars so im pretty disappoinby this film most of the ideas in the movie are pretty humorous and the jokes probably sounded hilarious on paper but a lot of the delivery is horrible most jokes fall pretty flat i think its largely due to macfarlanes directing the films pacing is pretty bad as well some jokes are hilarious though and the acting is all pretty good the film is also really bold and edgy like all of macfarlanes work you have to give it credit for that its a pretty flawed sequel but it does have plenty of momentswatch our movie review show movie talk at httpyoutuben95imm6vork,comedy
review i really didnt enjoy this movie because it exploits what made the first movie so great the direction and screenplay are terrible both the casting and acting are terrible also all in all i would give this zero out of a possible five stars,comedy
vulgar irreverent politically incorrect offensive to all cultures in every way possible hysterical a brilliant civil rights vehicle bravo a must see i wondered when the film starout are they going to far have they gone off the rails has one of my favorite new conceptual franchises lost its plot i hung in there and so glad i did with science fiction and fantasy as the two main genres used for spreading political spiritual and intellectual enlightenment its sure nice that cgi is being used to animate stuffed toys for a darn good reason to school us about what has become of western society sure other animafilms have done this but not with a teddy bear wielding a comedy baseball bat aside from that i just couldnt understand how two button eyes and a plush toy face was able to communicate such a wide range of emotion kudos to the special effects guys dont underestimate what it took for them to pull this off great writing directing and acting throughout cant wait for thanks warning if you cant handle a lot of swearing even if its to make a huge point you may not get through this film but its worth it,comedy
seems to have divided opinion though im unsure how anyone who enjoyed the original movie could criticize the sequel because the fact is that its even funnier ive now watched it three times and its a movie that rewards with more laughs on repeat viewings sure the crude humour wont be to everyones taste but then you already know that if you watched the original movie ive read that some see the movie as suffering from the absence of mila kunis but in fact amanda seyfried comfortably filled her shoes and even added to the lead female role i also dont get that some have criticized the storyline because its just a simple vehicle to carry the gags which keep coming throughout the movie,comedy
this movie is terrifically funny i couldnt stop laughing from start to finish it is virtually impossible not to like the character  a teddy bear that wants to be trealike a human sometimes simple ideas make for great stories as this movie proves hollywood can sometimes overly complicate things mark wahlberg is one of the main characters and just happens to be a great actor as well what is more remarkable is that the story is actually a court room drama but involving characters that are so ridiculously lovable as to transform the story into a spoof which works as comedy there is an edge to the humour which makes it even funnier just because is a toy doesnt mean he lacks feelings or a sense of humour and wittiness,comedy
after watching i watched the first one again same night as it happened to be on tvi realised that what makes the first one a classic is that its about a boy becoming a man without his innocence and identity dying altogether its a classic theme everyone can relate tothis is what holds back because mila kunis isnt in it it loses that progression so john bennett is back to square one so in place of the theme on growing up we are eventually introduced to a different kind of theme that of rights as a human being there are parallels made with the emancipation proclamation but they dont really make the most of this idea and in any case its a political rather than a personal theme that doesnt do enough for john bennetts journey the films work best when it is really about john  with being a symbol of his innocenceso isnt touching in the same way that is and i know it seems weird to talk about something as bad taste as as being touching but it is about a boy and his teddy bear but that said does have some great comedic set pieces i was crying with laughter in places and i kind of love it just for that,comedy
ties the knot with tamilyn and recruits his best friend joh as a sperm donor in order to start a family but when the commonwealth of massachusetts demands that appear before a judge to prove hes a real person the bear and his pal vow to fight for their civil rightsthe first movie was a refreshing funny and a wonderful hollywood debut for macfarlane but that was because it was just veering on the edge of offensive never going overboard with all the offensive humour that some people think is the height of hilaritynow while this sequel is funny in parts macfarlane has appeared to have sold out and gone full on offensive with his humour because the majority of the jokes in this are aimed at ethnicities and culture and there is one long running joke throughout the film which involves google that is just plain embarrassinglike family guy though the really funny parts are just random scenes that have nothing whatsoever to do with the story or narrative such as jay leno walking out of a bathroom or liam neesons scene which is the best thing about the filmwahlberg is as good as he was in the first even though it looks like he is overdoing it as times to get those extra laughs its seyfried though who really stands out in this the running joke of her not getting pop culture references is pretty genius and shows that macfarlane can make his cast feel comfortable being self deprecatingafter the disaster of a million ways to die in the west this did feel like it was made to cash in on its success and while at times it did its still a worthy sequel with lots of laughsjust next time lay off the racist humour seth,comedy
ok so i went to see this movie a little sceptical of what to expect didnt love or hate the first really however this was wonderful full of laughs and sweet treats from start to finish good heart as well if u are looking for a good buddy comedy i say see it you wont regret it one of the best comedy sequels this year fair warning its rar for a reason nearly every joke has a swear word or is about getting high or sexualy relain some way if u are offended by any of the above content skip this one u will thank me later mandy seifriend was perfect though fit right in with and jon hope she is in the next movie if there is one i say see it,comedy
its not bad being a comedy sequel it would never reach the hype of the first but its worth a look,comedy
in its purest form is a very seth mcfarlane comedy continuing the chronic chronicles of an unusual pair of bostonian best friendsas you may recall from its predecessor tells the story of john played by mark wahlberg and his talking teddy bear voiced by seth mcfarlane as they lackadaisically deal with life a few decades after coming to existence via a christmas miracle in this episode however the duo encounters more problems featuring obvious infertility the nullification of his marriage and his legal status regarding human life the story jumps around quite a bit but its more or less exactly what we would expect from a seth mcfarlane movieby now weve seen both extremes from mcfarlanes movies  the good from and the bad and the ugly from a million ways to die in the west  so when this sequel came around i entered the theater without any real expectations other than some solid comedy and some similar chemistry between wahlberg and mcfarlane what i got i might add was somewhere in that ballpark the story felt a bit more fun and even lighthearthan the original did in that the overall tone of the film was less dark and the story was a bit more of an outlandish adventure than its predecessor for all you film buffs out there this phenomenon is known as the evil dead effect and although it is not omnipresent throughout the film its often the first thing that i think of when i look back on this moviebut what about the comedy i mean thats what youre here for right well and johnnys backandforth dialogue is just as entertaining and fluent here as it was in the previous film and many of the jokes are even bigger and had me laughing even harder as well on top of that a lot of the comedy is incredibly uptodate and relevant thus making many of the jokes more shocking unexpecand hilarious however there were two comedic sources in the film that many viewers have had mixed reactions about and those sources are cameos and spoofs being a fan of many of the same things that seth mcfarlane enjoys eg jazz music movies television and comedy i particularly appreciate seeing his take on a number of pop culture icons including jurassic park trix cereal and morgan freeman just to name a few these jokes arent particularly visionary but i find great pleasure in seeing many of these references and familiar faces in a new comedic light even if that means ripping off planes trains and automobiles for the tenth time in his career but john hughes never gets old sorry too soonthis films greatest flaw lies in the fact that its plot was far from consistent it became very evident to me that in the storyboarding phase people just kept building off each others ideas and saying yeah lets go with that and then well throw that in there and oh  this would be funny too in that regard it makes it harder and harder to consider this a good movie as opposed to just another episode of family guy additionally it was frustrating to see that mila kunis did not return for this sequel for her absence completely undermines so many of the good messages and plot points that actually had that being said amanda seyfried still did a nice job of stepping into the spotlight as a new character and adding a new personality to the gang but it didnt change the fact that the plot remains such an inexcusable mess the movie winds down as the filmmakers must have run out of time or ideas so finally when the action kicks up in the last act of the film you find yourself watching something that you expecto see the whole time and it just isnt as original or inventive as the rest of the movies have been also their attempts at drama near the end are frustrating and a bit derivative yet the scene somewhat makes sense in comparison to the first filmall in all was a lot of fun to see  it had its hilarious and moderately funny moments and the music was fantastic as per usual but the overarching plot was certainly subpar to say the least so if you and your potentially existing friends are looking for something fun to watch and arent particularly concerned with admiring a work of cinematic art then will be worth your time to sit back and enjoy and if youre a big mcfarlane fan already chances are you wont care about the plot anyway and youll have a lot of fun with this movie hell  i think the opening musical number alone is worth a few buckschristian wanamaker aka c dubbsfinal rating 6710 conclusion fun to watch easy to criticizefor more reviews visit my website httpssitesgooglecomsitecdubbsfilmzone,comedy
greetings from lithuania2015 is not as good as the original but it a good sequel its funny entertaining with rough and obscene humor the are couple of funny cameos especialy by liam neeson  hilarious and the plot well its not the most important thing in this movie but it does work if you liked first movie you will definitely enjoy this one as well just maybe not that muchoverall is definitely worth seeing for those who liked the first one the are plenty of jokes that do work some jokes dont work dont take this movie to seriously and you will definitely enjoy the ride,comedy
not better then the first one even though people write that about it yes there are still some great lines but the whole concept is even more far fetched then the first one the first one was new and exciting this one is showing everyday life of a teddy bear and his wife then gets twisto a court battle over something that is clearly just stupid in many ways but thats the story line here this film has its moments but it just hasnt got the news sensation about it yes there are clever lines good jokes and funny scenes but for me that just wasnt enough this time around it had to be something new again most of it worked but we all knew where it was headed we all knew how it would end and we all knew that it would be childish jokes no point and just shenanigans all the waythe childish parts are the better ones mark wahlberg being kind of like a kid and having people follow his childish way of living and loving a teddy bear whilst in your mid 30th that is amusing but it just isnt enough,comedy
gets married to a nit brained woman and then finds out that he has lost all his civil rights because he is a toy not a person he is really property thats the premise now load on crudities and sight gags and cameos and a bunch of nonsense visit tom bradys house to get a sperm sample to create the perfect child visit a field of marijuana and hear music from jurassic park find a lawyer who is ready to face the civil rights laws that keep a stuffed bear from having his say in the world i cant review this film because like the first one it is one piece of craziness after another i went away giggling but know that civilized human beings shouldnt be watching this junk go see it if you have a relatively thick skin,comedy
that foulmouthed drug abusing teddy bear that we loved from the first  movie is back for more the film picks up 6 months after the first film  with and his best friend john still friends before is about to  get married and john is feeling down after having been in a divorce  once married it isnt what he imagined with his relationship in  trouble his solution is to have a baby little did he know that the  government would soon recognize how hes been living his life as a  person when his personhood comes into question he now has to fight to  maintain his marriage and for his own civil rights john and new  for this film a young female lawyer samantha l jackson obvious joke  alert must sue the state of massachusetts in order for to be  recognized as a person while tries to find someone for john  if youve seen the first film you wont be surprised by this one  youll get all the dirty homophobic humor that was in the first or  from any episode of family guy this film still seems to have the charm  that the first one had i also enjoyed the opening musical sequence of  the movie as well some may not be a fan of the humor in this film as  it could easily be considered offensive i dont know what that says  about me but i liked it i wasnt a fan of seth macfarlanes earlier  film a million ways to die in the west but this one has the right  amount of stupid but doesnt take it too far  sure there arent as many jokes in this as the first film so they chose  to take what they had and stretched it over the films running time at  almost 2 hours which could have been shorter the film occasionally  suffers from an identity crisis it wavers between a social commentary  about ones civil rights and an extended family guy episode but doesnt  do enough of either i did like what i saw but i just wished that there  was more of it i believe it could definitely have gone without a few  minor plot lines for i believe that they took away from the main story  and added to the unnecessary length i wont mention the few cameos in  the film other than that there is one noteworthy one that you will  definitely not expect but will definitely remember overall its not a  bad film but i thought it could have done more i liked this one just  as much as the first film but not more,comedy
the first one was funny but the sequel is a little better cause it has adventure and misadventure to put the character and his friends into why i liked better than hot tub time machine 2 well the hot tub sequel could not make any of the gags work they threw anything out there and it really shows and nobody was interesting and likable but in was the total opposite you really like the characters despite the stupid things they do leave it to seth macfarlane who can make you be charmed by foul humor and gross out gagstedvoiced by seth macfarlane wants to have a baby with his wife but then he is questioned by the law he is human or property mark wahlberg and seth macfarlane where funny and have a great comic chemistry so does amanda seyfried has there lawyer i mean you see that they where having the best time making this at times it feels like you are watching a family guy episode at times cause of all the homages to other classics all the other supporting cast do well also this film is like dumb and dumber to not great films but funny and entertaining films if you are not into to this then you avoid this then,comedy
so i just watched this sequel to with my movie theatreworking friend who had seen it the previous day but was willing to go through it again since he enjoyed it so much this one has the animateddy bear marrying his girlfriend from the previous one and then having lots of arguments with her a year later somewhere along the line they decide to have a baby to solve that dilemma andwell to make a long story short suddenly is not considered a person but property meaning he cant legally enjoy the benefits of human beings i found myself laughing quite a bit and being touched by the role reversal of mark wahlberg this time being in danger of not living amanda seyfried plays his new girlfriend and morgan freeman plays a possible attorney taking case in summary probably stretched seth macfarlanes premise as much as it can go though i suppose if another sequel gets made me and my friend will probably go to that one as well,comedy
a handful of names in show business divide people so strongly and seth macfarlane is one of them his pop culture references his often scatological and vulgar humor and the simultaneous repetition and aimlessness in his stories have made him the subject of a great deal of hate since i began watching family guy at a young age ive always admired macfarlanes ability to turn nothing into something taking the most ridiculous and baseless ideas for plots and balancing the right amount of out of place jokes in family guys case cutaway gags with some coherent sense of plot progression love him or hate him that kind of ability isnt seen often because its a difficult thing to pull offmacfarlanes films are a different breed however they are much longer than a twentytwo minute episode and with each one just hairs away from the two hour mark its understandable to see why many tire of his schtick and view his films as endurance tests what can work in twentytwo minutes doesnt necessarily pan out to a successful two hour venture macfarlanes directorial debut in film was a film that struck lightning in a bottle combining the strong tendencies of macfarlane incorporating chemistry ribald humor and romance all in one film sort of adhering to the likes of contemporaries like judd apatow it was an uproariously funny film one that shows the strengths of macfarlanes zaniness and mark wahlbergs talent in comedywith becoming the highestgrossing rracomedy a franchise was immediately born and is a film that is obviously birthed from extreme financial success macfarlane likely had little to no inkling that this character would go on to sustain another film so the very fact that he penned another adventure for his foulmouthed bear character is quite the feat the issue however is that while the first film held ground as consistently funny is more infrequently funny concerned with loud comedic sightgags and grossout events instead of focusing on the chemistrywe refocus on john bennett mark wahlberg and his talking stuffed teddy bear voiced by seth macfarlane this time watching and his longtime girlfriend tamilynn jessica barth marry one another before all their friends john is broken up over his recent divorce with lori and persistent encouragement of him to stop watching and meticulously organizing his porn and get back out in the dating game doesnt seem to workupon revealing to tamilynn that he wants to have a baby discovers from the state of massachusetts that he is not a legal citizen because he is property not an actual person as a result is fired from his job his marriage is annulled and he feels like a subhuman no matter where he goes in efforts to fight back john and hire sam jackson amanda seyfried a young lawyer about to embark on her first case to grant his civil rightssimilar to is overstuffed with content jokes characters and situational humor so much so that the film seems like an overstuffed teddy bear at any point ready to burst at its seems from the weight and pressure of all its contents much like its predecessor is at its funniest when john and are simply slumming on the couch exchanging insults playing pranks on one another or sharing a hearttoheart consider the scene where sam speaks to a civil rights attorney morgan freeman on the phone whilst john and fight over the last bud light in the fridgescenes like that are glimmers of humor in a film that occasionally finds itself too obsessed with overblown scenes like the fairly obvious one at a sperm bank or the ridiculous and ostensibly neverending chase sequence at comiccon one of the films subplots which revolves around the janitor for hasbro attempting to steal so he can figure out how to make hundreds of talking bears like him is incredibly anticlimactic when it arrives at its conclusion and the film is littered with stunt casting the likes of liam neeson tom brady dennis haysbert and morgan freeman that its a wonder if the film is confident in its main characters to sustain a film finally the absence of mila kunis in the film isnt a total loss for seyfried comes with just enough personality to sustain the supporting role save for some strangely placed scenes like her song as her john and sit in a marijuana farm and seyfried is actually a pleasant addition to the filmhas some hilarious oneliners but the chemistry between john and is the real reason for seeing the film there is an undeniable aura of positivity throughout this whole film one that macfarlane predicates on top of engulfing the film with loud performances and constant efforts to make the audience laugh with all the jokes and antics that occur in this film its only expecmany miss and macfarlane proves that even if he isnt on stage hes still breaking a sweat with all that he does in his projects,comedy
what do u expect from more f bombs more drug use but overall it has thunder buddies heart to this story so this is a sequel thats better than the original funnier and twitter one liners and cool soundtrack and cameos galore so with getting married but his party life getting in the way they have marriage issues so he wants to adopt a child but law says he is not human so he wants to prove this in court so they hire a inexperienced bongo smoking pot lawyer for as he faces the biggestbattle of his life so john helps him try and get a donor for him cue a laugh out loud moments in the sperm bank it should be ok those are just the rejecsickle cell samples did you hear that youre covered in rejecblack mens semen you look like a kardashian as there is a taken moment with a cereal for kids moment in the supermarket hash john gets his nervous side effects out on the street they hire a first time lawyer to help but them out but lose his case and deemed property so with a old enemy near by donnie he has a plan to get to make money so hatches a plan so with a killer sounds track john and samantha the lawyer go to a better lawyer on a road trip and leave to drive and in doing so flies into a barn so as they realizes what he has done to the car they stay the night singing and opened mouthed looks across the field thinking he in heaven with jurassic theme i kid you not hilarious scene of a field of hash plants as he said there moving in herds there plenty of action comic con moments in new york great twist near the end which i wont give away as its heartfelt and plenty of thunder stoner jokes and great hash tags moments please gives us another film one of the funniest sequels every even the whole cinemas was laughing best comedy of the year,comedy
not even close to which few movies can replicate that strategy but this one bombed badly i debaon staying through till the end just very disappointing and im sure the previous success of making almost 600000000 was the basis for creating but it shouldnt come close to hitting that mark save your money your time and just accept that this one isnt that greatdont get me wrong this movie had some good zingers and a few funny moments however it just looked as if the crew was trying so hard to make us laugh i got the feeling that the writers were searching for anything to make someone laugh and they just couldnt capitalize off of their previous success at least dave chapelle just said no when he was out of good material i still love seth mcf and his whit is amazing,comedy
well where do i start i think it has to be with this advice if you dont like the first family guy or anything else from seth macfarlanes repertoire you wont like this film if you are easily offended you wont like this film if swearing makes you cringe you wont like this film if like me you adore the macfarlane humour you will be just fine is just as funny as its predecessor full of jokes from beginning to end with an story that plays out to a satisfying conclusion the film begins with wedding to tamilynn strong humour from the start and were told early that lori mila kunis wont be returning as she and john mark wahlberg have divorced this sets up a temporary mirror of the first film where john was loved up and was alone we leave the wedding and go into the opening credits which house one of the largest and most impressive dance routines i have seen in a while once the film continues postamazing dance and tamilynn have reached a tough spot in their marriage a colleague suggests that they have a baby to fix their problems i hear that works for just about everybody and the crux of the story begins as can produce children he tries a series of methods to find a donor before moving onto adoption when they find out tamilynn cant have children either it is at the adoption centre the couple are informed that they cant adopt due to tamilynns drug convictions and the fact that is not technically a person this was all much funnier than ive made it sound i am actively avoiding joke spoiling as there is nothing worse than knowing all of the jokes before you see the film life falls out from under his own feet as he is deemed property by the government and here begins war on civil rights to say more about the film would give away too much and as somebody that hates people spoiling everything in a review i will leave the plot description hereamanda seyfried is great in she isnt afraid to poke fun at herself and it looks like shes having a blast on set i wouldnt be surprised to see her return if any further sequels are made mark wahlberg once again brings his strongest boston self to the table and continues to act pretty damn well considering a lot of his interaction is with a cgi bear we see morgan freeman a little later into the film and although hes not doing anything too different to his normal roles i will never grumble at seeing the man on screen giovanni ribisi returns as creepy villain donny and surpasses himself with his ability to make my other half cringe in her seat shes pretty easy to weird out there are loads of celebrity cameos but ill leave it to you to see them for yourselves theyre all funny but there is one in particular that tickled me more than any of the others at 115 minutes did run a little longer than i would like i was starting to get fidgety towards the end but luckily the humour was consistent enough throughout that i didnt lose any interest the screening i went to was almost full and there were quite a lot of american pop culture jokes that went over the head of the uk audience i caught pretty much all of them but im a pretty big fan of all things american i imagine those jokes will kill in the usa but to those of you in the uk dont worry if youre a little lost occasionally youre certainly not alone as i said at the beginning if you enjoyed the first film or any of the other work of seth macfarlane check this out and enjoy the laughter,comedy
i loved while i didnt think it was perfect i think it is one of the best comedies of all time so of course i wana sequel and i got itit is just a really great sequel but i dont think it is as constant as the original its one of those films where you smile all the time and laugh a lot but i think it could be even funnier the pace is a little off because theres long stretches of the film where you smile yes but you should laugh and you dontthe story is great and it has truly great dramatic moments that would be worth of a great drama while i didnt like that they passed on mila kunis i loved amanda seyfried she brings a lot to the filmtheres many awesome moments all the characters are back aside from mila kunis and you will have a truly great time but if you are not american like im not you should do a bit of research because the film has tons of references to american things and celebrities that most of outsiders wont know or understandthis is a must see and you will have a wonderful time but i think it could be even more funnier and even more daring its a shame the box office pales in comparison to the first film because i would love to see a another especially considering how the film ended and the great story and opportunity to make tons of great laughsthat would have been but i guess everyone else doesnt agree,comedy
after a year of marriage and tamilynn need something to respark their love for each other the solution a baby needs to prove hes a person in the eyes of the law to qualify to be a parenti was pleasantly surprised by this movie it had me crouched over laughing kept me intereswith a steady flow of giggles throughout and what more do you need in this sort of comedy its not gonna have godfather esque acting and directing its the chemistry between john mark wahlberg seth macfarlane and samantha amanda seyfried was marvellous i especially loved the scene where they looked over the weed farm plantation place and the jurassic park music comes on that was genius supporting cast like patrick warburton and michael dorn who play gay couple guy and rick were excellent who if you like slap stick tripping people over comedy than they did it superbly and kept the giggles flowing smaller parts from the legends like morgan freeman and liam neeson didnt hurt too i felt the storyline was interesting enough but the darker scenes with the fantastically cast giovanni ribisi as donny just went away as quickly as them came also there was no real substance to those parts of the story as with the first film it was fresher and had that unpredictability of not knowing how far he would go with this one you never really got that it just felt like it was shoe horned in to make for a baddies scene this let the film down for me the script was top draw through out i personally didnt mind all the weed jokes as long as they were quirky and original the penis bong i thought was funny and iv touched on the jurassic park themed weed farm already the cinematography was notably good as well i hope this has more rewatchablity than the first after a 34 watched of it went dramatically down in my rating overall i thought this film really held its own and was a satisfactory sequel to the first that was hugely enjoyable and was a very fun watch,comedy
i was hoping they wouldnt explain mila kunis absence in the film as a divorce and was kind of angry when they did since johns relationship with lori was the whole point of the first film as the movie moved along however it didnt seem as important especially when john is explaining the failing relationship to the new female lead played by amanda seyfriedi have to say i think this film made me laugh much harder than the first one did and the amazing part about this is that while it was still funnier with random comedic bits and sometimes cutaways like in family guy it also had a much better and slightly more complex plot than the first after and tammylynn submit an application to adopt a baby life is ruined once his case is reviewed and he is not considered a person in the eyes of the government his marriage is invalid he loses his job and he cannot adopt a baby as he wants to which also makes for a much more serious plot than the first moviei dont want to give away any of the comedic bits since this would spoil the jokes but i really do think this movie has funnier moments than the first and sometimes more disgusting moments also the good thing is that the humor is spread throughout the film pretty evenly so you get good laughs every now and then instead of just at one or two portions of some jokes do fall flat especially when there is a reference to snl which doesnt have a very good cast nowadays anyway if you want to know more about the comedic tone of the movie just look at my review for im not going to state the tone of the movie again if i dont have to,comedy
more sick over the top humour if you loved you will feel the same about the same on the mark stereotyped dysfunctional character driven humour seth creates uncomfortable sick humour which intertwines with a dysfunctional character driven story the story and events are weak looking at the series one has to view the genre as if one is watching the movie porkys there is a social message mixed in with fluff the original is better because of the famous flash gordon scene and the over the top poo beginning my wife almost peed her pants laughing at though i wonder how as political correctness marches on what people will think of years from now i believe will either be tame or too offensive 6 or 7 out of 10,comedy
too much dick and pot jokes not even funny dick this and dick that seth macfarlane need to come out of the closet already enough said,comedy
this could not be worse firstly the f word is used a zillion times in the first 5 minutes dirty or forceful vulgarity is so appropriate magnificent poignant when used sparingly and with punch at the right moment otherwise i think brainless writers and compliant actors its not as disgusting and low life uneducatrash talk which isnt the least bit humorous of interesting the whole deal looked like the actors were asleep the entire show i have no idea how they could stand doing it i paid online and so wish i hadnt because i couldnt force myself to watch it making things worse was i had watched what we do in the shadows and hunt for the wilderpeople the night before taiki waititi stuff out of new zealand is gut bustingly the best ive seen in decades maybe ever percentagewise american movies especially comedy or even dramaare so much worse than whats coming out of new zealand and the scandinavian river lillyhammer in this dirty language smut porn references repeatedly to blk c i forced myself to watch around 15 minutes and had to turn it off i thought mark wahlberg the fighter but who is this mark wahlberg on reflection i realize wahlberg does mostly stuff thats below par and produces the same in the fighter his costar christian bale does wow stuff there arent words strong enough to say how bad this flick is and watching taiki waititis stuff the night before made all the much worse no american comedy comes close to whats coming out elsewhere i dont know if its the facebook generation which has made americans unable to communicate seeping into everything or what but yuk like la la land which i thought was bad compared to fred astaire and gene kelly and donald oconnor and sid charise and red buttons shecky green red skelton marx brothers laurel and hardy ma and pa kettle abbot and costello dick van dyke steve allen sid ceasar jack benny george burns and gracey allen jonathan winters robin williams was the only modern day comic to grave or era art carney jackie gleason richard pryor red fox moms mabley eddie murphy bill cosbie flip wilson come to think of it we do have many black comedians today and some white dudes not a good show,comedy
long story short is too boring and not actually funny the first film was a whole lot better and very different from this one has about as many songs as frost which for a film not markeas a musical usually is a sign of having too much film and not enough content this is no exception the jokes are few and far apart and the plot so awkward that it almost feels forced and annoying when its brought upthe intro is quite good though and there are a lot of guest stars but there are so many better things to do with two hours of your life than watching this film i turned off after i ran out of both toe and bellybutton fluff,comedy
we thought that the 1st movie was hilarious but this sequel was just overly filled with adolescent bathroom trash humor the shame of it is that it had so much potential but unlike the 1st one this movie was littered with adolescent trashy humor maybe littered is a little too easy it was polluwith it there are some jokes in the movie that were side splitting hilarious only to be followed up by a stream of immature garbage mark once again did a fantastic job as did most of the cast it was the writing this time around that gave you the feeling that it was mostly written by high school freshmen who were so stoned that they actually thought that their immature humor was actually funny so sad,comedy
although i must confess im some sort of macfarlanist objectively speaking this is a great film for those who like his style of humorsure there are moments when the script is a little bland and even the end might be kind of predictable but it does have its doses of memorable catchphrases and echoing laughter i was the one who laughed the most at the theater sorry for that after getting old ive developed my fair share of creepy dark sense of humoranyways after being afraid id walk out disappoinfrom the screening i discovered with delightful twisrelief that the whole movie is a big wtf where you dont know what famous celebrity youd encounter in the next scene performing in a strange yet relatable role as everything that comes from seths brilliant piece of mind this film just goes ahead and pees on societythen turns around and lets off a big loud one on its face boom no censorshipcertainly wont make a better person out of you nor intentionally evoke revealing insights or epiphanies let alone shake the foundations of your deep soul will simply release that evil monster inside your being laughter after laughter after all thats the only thing its creator has ever intended and boy does he deliver,comedy
well for me it was better than the first sequel but i will still give it 6,comedy
has such a wonderful cast and great storyline seth mcfarlane never disappoints there is laughter throughout the entire movie love silly antics heartache hope a new love story blossoming i would highly recommend this movie to anyone above the age 18 a film,comedy
much better than the first one with lots of funny parts but still lots of jokes that miss or that ive seen before mostly from family guy also failed at trying to be serious at a bunch of parts and had dumb musical routines like we always see from seth mcfarlane 1 viewing,comedy
is a comedy  fantasy movie and the sequel of the movie in which we watch and tamilynn getting married in the meantime they want to have a baby but they find many obstacles in front the most serious obstacle is that the government does not recognize as a person but as a property so has to prove in court that he is a person in order to be allowed to have a childi liked this movie and i had a really great time watching it but since i had already watched the first movie i expecmore for the second unfortunately it wasnt as good as the first and it had some boring moments and some others that didnt make any sense of having them the direction which was made again by seth macfarlane was very interesting and it combined very well for one more time comedy with romance and comedy with drama about the interpretations i enjoyed for one more time the interpretation of mark wahlberg who played as john bennett and seth macfarlanes voice as some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were jessica barths who played as tamilynn giovanni ribisis who played for one more time as donny and morgan freemans who played as patrick meighan i expecmore from amanda seyfried who played as samantha and i believe that she didnt reach her potential with her interpretation in this moviein conclusion i have to say that is a funny movie with many humorous moments but its not as good as the first movie despite that i recommend everyone to watch this movie because i am sure that you are going to have a lot of fun and you are going to laugh a lot if you have already watched the first movie then it would be better not to expect from it to be as good as the first if you are prepared about it then you are going to like it very much too,comedy
its not as good as the first one maybe its not surprising and expectations are too high the first 13 lacks sincerity and the latter slowly shows its own characteristics i always feel that this kind of film cant have any plot that is to say its just right to have the lowest waves,comedy
this movie seemed to be a bit of a moneymaker after the success of the first film it wasnt really needed and not as funny as the first,comedy
is one of those films where you can laugh and forget about it the next day doesnt really compete with nor does it try to,comedy
it had some big laughs in the beginning when it dealt with marriage and problems getting his wife pregnant then it had this weird midtwist of him being property where he isnt a person and the marriage wasnt legal and he had to go to court which i thought was boring and their lawyer was inexperienced and not a very interesting character the movie also repeasome of the laughs in the second hour of so i find this summer to be uneven with terminator genysis insidious chapter 3 avengers age of ultron mad max fury road and now being big ideas that run out after awhile i also didnt like spy which i thought was mostly boring with a dumb plot twist involving jason stathams character hopefully i will enjoy inside out and jurassic world i liked san andreas but that was just a fun summer movie that seemed made specifically for a summer release more than most actionspecial effects movies nothing great in that one,comedy
now i will admit that i enjoyed the absurdity of the first movie and found the first movie to be very funny and enjoyable so of course i was expecting at least the same level from the sequelbut it went as most sequel do the wrong way turned out to be nothing more than a mediocre attempt to cash in on the success of the first movie it was lacking all the comedy and funny situations as were present in the first movie it was a bad decision to opt for a more serious approach for the sequel because it just didnt pan out and it failed to work in any wayit just got tiring to watch and his girlfriend trying to fight for their right to have a baby and it just sidetracked the movie entirely it took a heavy toll on the comedy that could have been there and they had a lot of chances to go for something hilarioussuffered from having a what seemed to be hastily written storyline which was under duress from a deadline and whatever comedy was written into the movie just was way under the standards set in the first movie the dialogue satire and jokes in part two were not even half as inyourface as in the first movieand it didnt really help much that it seemed like mark wahlberg sort of didnt want to be present for the filming of the movie his commitment and enthusiasm from the first movie was nowhere to be seen in this sequelsure there were a couple of laughs here and there but was nowhere near its predecessor in any way and while you can return to watch the movie again and again that proves not to be the case with the sequel this is a watch once and let it fade into sweet oblivion situationthe only thing that had me amused and entertained was the entire scene taking place at the convention that was actually the high point of the entire movieit has been seen and i can check it off the towatchlist and i cant claim to be impressed in any way by 2,comedy
the original was one of the most unique movies i had ever seenand also one of the best movies i saw in 2012 i was a fan of the family guystyle humor as well as the fact that a movie about a living stuffed bear could make me both laugh and feel unfortunately this sequel while still providing a number of good laughs just couldnt live up to its predecessor in any categoryfor a basic plot summary resumes the life stories of voiced by seth macfarlane and john mark wahlberg and their crazy antics is now married to fellow cashier tamilynn jessica barth and they want to have a little teddy running around however after the obvious insemination difficulties  they are stymied further when is ruled property by the government the gang decide to fight the case and are assigned samantha l jackson amanda seyfried as the junior lawyer hoping to make a mark in her career by winning the casethe obvious issue with this movie is that the novelty has worn off in the first film mcfarlane could practically get by with the sight gag of a talking teddy bear that is no longer the case now with this next film having to rely solely on the humor much like family guy which is now almost completely in the tank its comedy has dried up cant sustain nearly two hours on straight comedy alone with the novelty gone it turns into more of a generic runofthemill comedic effortanother weakness is that the role mila kunis played in part one is not present here seyfried brings her own style to the proceedings this time dont get me wrong but there was a better chemistry between kunis wahlberg and macfarlane again though perhaps that is just as much because the story is more original in that original filmall of that being said still managed to provide me with enough laughs to give it a decent threestar ranking had it not staroff so terribly slow after nearly 30 minutes i was worried it was going to be a completely unfunny disaster it could have even been bumped a tad higher unless a really original groundbreaking script surfaces for this franchisecharacters it is likely that this will and should be the last installment in the adventures of our furry friend i would probably see a third onebut with extremely lowered expectations,comedy
i am an unabashed seth macfarlane fan i loved the first in 2012 and i even for whatever reason enjoyed a million ways to die in the west way more than most people would think acceptable but that doesnt stop me from recognizing that maybe just maybe never needed to happen and when i discovered it was happening id hoped macfarlane and his writing team would come up with a fun new reason to rejoin the adventures of john bennett mark wahlberg and his plus pal voiced by macfarlane it certainly appears so at first but then it isnt long before it devolves into rehashed elements from the first film we rejoin them as and his girlfriend tamilynn jessica barth are tying the knot in a ceremony overseen of course by flash gordon himself sam jones we flash forward a year and see that married life isnt going so well for the lovebirds and is given the idea that having a child will rejuvenate their marriage seeing as how hes a stuffed bear the usual means of procreation are out of the question and after a series of misadventures he and tamilynn turn to adoption heres where life begins to fall apart his adoption attempt red flags him with the government whose official stance is that is not a person but property is the tale of john and teaming with a young stoned upstart lawyer amanda seyfried in an attempt to battle the court system and award personhoodhas some stuff that works i love that a portion of the film becomes a road movie with john and seyfrieds sam l jackson driving from boston to new york to meet with a famed civil rights lawyer morgan freeman in hopes that hell take case that whole segment of the film works for me and i kind of wished the whole movie had been one big crazy road movie i also enjoyed the breakfast club homagemontage in the library when the trio are preparing to first argue case i loved the usual string of pop culture gags and raunchy humor we expect from macfarlane and i loved the chemistry between wahlberg seyfriend and seyfried was a treat in million ways to die but macfarlane upgrades her to co star this time around and as with theron in the former movie its great how game she is to sink to the levels of humor these movies call for since macfarlane is a self professed geek we also get some great cameos thatll make star trek fans grin especially michael dorn lieutenant worf from next generationdeep space nine for those not in the know as patrick warburtons lover the problem is when macfarlanes geekiness gets a little out of hand in the final act of the film set entirely in new york comicon where its as if someone broke the valve off his pop culture love and it just starts spewing uncontrollably all over the place it becomes a literal battle royale of beloved pop culture iconsthat overindulgence i couldve forgiven if the rest of the movie hadnt tripped over itself and faceplani have two grievances with the first is the rehashing of plot lines from the first its annoying enough that we have to go through an entire new romantic subplot for john and sam john has married and divorced mila kunis lori in the time since the last film rendering the plot of that movie pointless but also brings back donnie as played by giovanni ribisi i really liked ribisi in the first movie the man knows how to play awkward and creepy and donnies obsessive quest to acquire for his own son was both in donnie now works for hasbro and conspires with the ceo to steal who is now property so it wouldnt be kidnapping and cut him open to see what makes him sentient did we need to revisit donnies unhealthy obsession with stealing couldnt we have found a new antagonist for the movie maybe the toy company itself with the ceo leading the charge again it wouldve been nice to change things up a bit my other big mark against is how seriously it takes the human rights issue at the center of it all we get not one but two overly serious lawyer speeches in front of juries explaining how is more human than toy guys this is a movie where a stuffed bear tries to steal tom bradys semen keep it light overall feels aimless like it just doesnt know where it wants to focus its energy and the constant borrowing from the first films playbook makes me think couldve spent a little more time in the planning stages to bring us a fun new emphasis on new thunder buddy adventure instead of what we got,comedy
now this movie was much better than the first because this movie has a deeper plot with just as many laughs only thing i disliked about the film is that it doesnt carry the intensity from beginning to end in the beginning its much funnier and it sets itself up to be much more intense than the previous about midway much of its intensity is lost due towhy would you type moments for instance in movie one was ripped in half and it was made obvious that hes composed of regular teddy bear stuffing in this second movie the same guy that kidnapped him and witnessed him die composes a plan with the ceo of a toy company the plan revolved around kidnapping and then dissecting him to see what makes him real when in actuality we already know it was just a magical wish and is still composed of regular stuffing nothing special even states it himself as hes about to get dissecalso before the plan was in affect mark wahlberg loses in a crowd for reasons i cant understand they let walk off by himself and then decided to look for him 10 minutes later lastly the romance this movie tries to capture is a bit shaky its nearly obvious that amanda is perfect for mark within the first minutes of her appearance but there love connection develops painstakingly slow it wouldve been much more enjoyable to watch them come together earlier in the movie work through some adversity and get his rights,comedy
probably looks like an unnecessary sequel but the foul mouthed dope taking duo are back and they even made me laugh a few timesvoiced by seth macfarlane has married tammilynn but a few months later they are involved in tantrums and their relationship is heading for the rocks john mark wahlberg has already split up from lori and turns down all offers to hook upwants to adopt a baby in order to save his marriage but then finds out that he needs to be classed as a person and further to this he loses his job and his marriage is not classifiedneeds to prove to the court that he is a person and not property with the help of lawyer sam jackson amanda seyfried meanwhile donny the villain from the first film has new plans to take and sell him to a toy company so they can make new just like himthe film has pop culture references and nods to sci fi genre and musicals as has several song and dance sequences several members of the star trek franchise make cameos i guess it is to do with the plot of what makes a man a subject covered in stng a segment of the film takes place at comiccon and sam jones turns up again as well as few other star appearances such as jay leno hanging around gents toilets and liam neeson wanting to buy cereal aimed at kidsa lot of it follows the first film simply because they have the same villain the road trip element to new york to visit a high powered lawyer spoofs planes trains and automobiles and jurassic parkthe film is amusing a few laughs as well as a few groans if you are under 30 years of age you are not going to get all the references but it was a better sequel than expecand you really believe john and as friends who hang out together,comedy
after the first film i was expecting a disappointing sequel and whilst some of fell a little flat such as a few rehashed gags from there was still plenty of humour to keep me entertained the only negative to me was johns new love interest who was there just to bounce gags off and really didnt add anything to the film having said that there are plenty of good moments and maybe it was a bit more of a feel good movie than the first one in trouble after trying to adopt a baby and has to fight for his rights so that were meant to care enough for to allow him to become a person i think theres enough heart still left over for,comedy
seth macfarlane marries tamilynn jessica barth while john bennett mark wahlberg is divorced from lori collins a year later and tamilynn are not getting along they decide to have a baby to save their marriage she cant conceive and they try to adopt the government takes notice and declares not a person they hire inexperienced lawyer samantha jackson amanda seyfried to fight in court donny giovanni ribisi is still after but now he has the backing of hasbro ceojohn and chemistry is growing on me theyre still good together and tamilynn is great the biggest problem is the trial the whole idea of the original is that everybody treats like any other loudmouthed idiot people treats him the same as everybody else the trial breaks that illusion and then spits on it its also a downer and i dont see how those court scenes be made funnier the movie is perfectly fine as a drug caper with the boys on a road trip i have nothing against seyfried but macfarlane should have gotten a real comedian in the role instead of the prettiest girl whos a little funny there are a few other minor problems but the boys are still fun together,comedy
 starts with an opening sequence with credits and logos done right the annoying 1 minutes of logos in movies before the action finally starts is not there thanks to seths amazing taste in musicals and big bands there are a lot of in your face subliminal messages about rights adding a flavor of family guy with cutaways adds to the fun high profile cameos and locations like comiccon great music as expecby seth bigger budget  more awesome action and effects the plot was fine until the reused antagonist showed up the movie would have been funny and great without him got angry ran away and got kidnapped again why did it take the enterprise incident to see had emotions he displayed all kinds of emotions all throughout his life he was a big name celebrity when he was newly brought to life and he showed humor and other emotions then he also showed emotion during the first court case it is unfounded to say he is not a person in the first case but then overturn the ruling because of further display of emotionwatched 031216 written 031616,comedy
i dont expect it to make sense its a comedy the real issue is why macfarlane thought that the legality of identity would be funny because its not the philosophical semantics kill any laughs because theyre so dry all the amusing bits are cutaways and side gags of the type that macfarlane is famous for but they have nothing to do with the main plot so a naturally lighter subject should have been chosen for the story to make the whole thing flow better and feel funniermacfarlane seems to think he can take heavy subjects like big screaming fight scenes a raging bull homage and they will automatically be made funny because a teddybear is there not true you have to be cleverer than that hes a funny guy but he surrounds his amusing ideas with belaboured bits that go on too long and then has to use a popculture joke or a movie reference to reverse himself out of the culdesac his singlemindedness has creathe longer a misfire goes on the more youre likely to notice it keep the attempts at humour snappier so that the duds are likely to slide off quickerjust because youve creaa character and its funny doesnt mean that everything you do with them is golden he should be thankful for the few genuine laughoutloud moments hes got in the tank because they get him out of jail and earn this movie a higher rating than it would otherwise deservethe laughs are there but theyre not as diverse as the first movie it tries to be oddly serious and weighty for some reason and its not a great choice recommended only for those who would watch in anything,comedy
i thought that the first movie was a decent comedy  far from a classic but i did laugh enough that i was glad to have seen it despite this i was a little wary about seeing this sequel knowing how inferior sequels usually are as well as the fact that seth macfarlanes a million ways to die in the west was mostly a misfire but i ultimately decided to give this sequel a chance when i got the opportunity to see it for free via my local libraryfirst i will give macfarlane credit for coming up with a premise for this sequel that unlike many sequels gives a fresh premise instead of recycling the same basic story  the desire for to be legally classified a human the satiric possibilities for this are endless surprisingly though the movie does not spend too much time in direct focus on this there are short bursts of this plot from time to time with lengthy focus on generating other kinds of gags in betweenactually that isnt as bad as it sounds because these gags are often at times very funny i did laugh a good amount of times throughout the movie though macfarlane and his cowriters do try too often to generate gags through shock alone instead of making the humor more creative a bigger problem however is that the screenplay is much too long and slow now i watched the unraversion of the movie which is nine minutes longer than the theatrical version  that might have contributo this problem but i think that viewers who watch the shorter version will notice how thin and slow the story isif you really liked the first movie  and are in a patient mood  youll probably find a good amount of to be entertaining despite its often greatly uneven nature it will probably help if you manage to see it for free as i did,comedy
i cant deny it  i find something inherently funny about a cursing potsmoking teddy bear its a format where you dont have to do much to get laughs if the viewer is likely to respond to that kind of thing if the viewer doesnt see the humour there really isnt a huge amount that can be done  these movies do rely on finding an audience with a particular kind of sense of humourthe problem with is that it doesnt really distinguish itself from the original so while the jokes still work if they ever worked they lack novelty the filmmakes seem to have realized this and responded by amping up the crudeness and the overall yuckfactor fair enough i guess but is already as crude and yucky as he needs to be  enough is a feast as we say around my way theres a ghost of a hint of a plot based around the question whether a talking bear can be considered a person for the purposes of law what defines personhood is an interesting question and one that lies at the heart of a number of number of contemporary ethical problems however this aspect of the movie is treawith such a juniorhigh lack of depth and insight that its almost offensive it would perhaps have been better if the filmmakers had just cut this stuff and squeezed in some extra knob gags and fartingso yeah if you laughed at most likely youll laugh at this but probably not as much,comedy
is an amazing comedy really funny also very entertaining much better than the first my opinion i would recommend this movie to a friendfamily or anyone who has not seen this film yetthe film has a very good storyline which makes the film that much more better the storyline also made a lot of sense so younger kids would be able to understand what the film is aboutthe only bad part about the film is that it seems way too short i wish it was that little bit longer but time does fly whilst watching this film very enjoyable this film is a film that you cannot watch on your own the film is much more enjoyable when with someone,comedy
is a movie that looks like the first in a lot of times the same jokes about drugs sex and namecalling the villain is the same of the first movie toobut now the premises of this movie is a little more interesting trying prove he is a person with rightsim listening some peoples say that movie is so worse than first but i dont guess if they changed the movie to dont look like the first probably the same peoples would talk this movie is so boring and the first is so better by me they can keep working like this for the 4 5 i hope this existto the conclusion i enjoyed this movie its good to break off some laughsps the scene with the ninjas turtles dancing was amazing and i laughed so much,comedy
i saw and feel it is only a tad better than the first one i like when there becomes a humanistic side to the story when the characters try and prove being a human under the court of law thats an interesting concept but overall it doesnt quite rise above macfarlanes trademark humor it is a silly movie that is basically a feature length family guy episode mark wahlberg is entertaining to watch and amanda seyfried is passable as the pro bono junior lawyer who takes their case its sort of a road trip movie as the two of them along with go to new york scene stealing morgan freeman who in my opinion is beyond this material appears in a couple of scenes as a civil rights lawyer who they hope to help them out its far from me to completely disregard this movie seeing is that i can see what theyre trying to do and fortunately is not a retread of the first movie the thing however is that this probably couldve been better maybe if they had trimmed a good twenty minutes off it such as the sperm donor scenes in the beginning to me were overlong and juvenile goes in a needlessly roundabout way along with wahlberg to get his wife pregnant by artificial insemination and the long ending at comic con in new york if the writing was a bit better and with tighter editing it would probably be good,comedy
seth macfarlane bounces back from his dismal a million ways to die in the west 2014 and does what he does best reference pop culture his vulgar stuff has become such a selfimposed given that at times it appears it is there only because it is expecafter all how far can you go with poop and farts its just redundantbut his legion of fans expect it and has become a touchtone and badge of honor for him and his audience and is used to separate the card carriers from the curious this one may be better than the first but that is hard to qualify or quantifysome of the jokes are hilarious and the amount of attempts to draw a laugh is huge it is nonstop and thats a good thing there is a certain rhythm that is difficult to pull off in a twohour running time but it mostly managesmacfarlane has an obvious sensitive side that never seems contrived or forced it comes off as sincere that may be his saving grace because no matter how many times he is unpc or racist with his humor or just flatout gross it all seems like goodnatured jabs like you know among friendsoverall this movie should please his fans but it is unlikely to gain him any new ones you either like seth macfarlane and what he does or you dont the overwhelming success of family guy and now his movies makes it obvious that this likable gadfly will be around to poke the eye of prudes the pc and the censors for some time,comedy
a comedy film relies on timing as well as gags i watched the unraversion of this film so i am not sure how much different my viewing is from the theater experience one thing i already knew was i saw the original in the theater and then the dvd you gotta give the people what they expect and the unradoes thatthe major cast change from the first film is mila kunis is gone and replaced by jessica barth who along with amanda seyfried both represent bleached blondes throwing curves quite nicely this movie adds morgan freeman as a high power civil rights lawyer in one of his less serious roles to good effectit brings up the issue from americas civil war  is a living being a person or property no matter what their form this could get even more profound in the future as computers like ibms watson could challenge if a machine could be considered a being like hal was in 2001 a space  but reading too much into this concept is not what this film is made forthis film is made for fun and put your brain away throw away lines on this level it succeeds how many movies can literally1 drain tom bradys balls 2 destroy a sperm donor bank3 marry a bear to a bleached blonde4 prove that drugs can provide a woman birth controlwell so much for those things there are some gags here that work well and some that do not at least it does not feature nude men wrestling like borat there are some standards here,comedy
im not a huge fan of comedy sequels they rarely ever work but having patrick stewart narrate and centering the third act of your film at comiccon gives you an immediate advantage the first film was great it was a stoner comedy without rogen that actually works really well seth macfarlanes humor isnt the easiest to accept at times but in these films it seems to hit all the right spots but why even do a sequel sure making 500 million warrants at least an attempt but did the story even remotely call for another story with these guys not at all with that said macfarlane found a way to bring these characters backand pretty much make the same exact film maybe not as identical plot points as both the jump street films but the story beats are very similar for the two films which can sometimes be to its detrimenteven with all of that i really enjoyed there are still plenty of laughs to be had not only does macfarlane include timely cameos from famous people including liam neeson and tom brady but the jokes hit more often than not the funniest of the films gags centers around a google search that still has me giggling a day later i would almost go as far as saying some of the laughs surpass even the heights of the first filmthe problem is that the story isnt fresh at all it echoes all the same plot points as the first including the unbearable character that giovanni ribisi plays mila kunis isnt in it which does at times feel strange and even jarring at first but i think amanda seyfrieds new dynamic with the duo was good enough to keep the film going but kunis absence may leave fans feeling indifferent about the storyin all pursuit of being a human surpassed my expectations of it being a comedy sequel even if the story is a near rehash of the first film the second half relies too heavily on the gags of the first and it does run probably 15 minutes too long but there are still plenty of laughs to be had herecameosplenty of funny gagscomic con settingstory is nothing newribisis annoying character7610,comedy
no surprise why this film failed to excite me but a few people thinks its a passable sequel the original movie was atypical so the success followed it in my perspective better that should have left as a oneoff movie but as a low budget product they knew it was going grab back twice thrice they spent because of the star value and indeed the first films influencethere is no story simply based on the usual hollywood road adventure like the flicks fanboys dumb and dumber to not suitable for children et cetera except the character which makes this theme a special a couple of good jokes and thats it the rest were ineffective sometime keep repeating the same ones the 2 hours in a too plain concept is way too long to sit and watchfocusthe cameos were weak or maybe worthlessmeaningless especially liam neesons the best things were the production quality acting and like i mentioned before the character for the one time watch i think kind of manageable but definitely not suitable for repeat viewing or to recommend it to the others but overall a little disappoinwith the outcome they have got one more chance to end this franchise on a high note as a decent trilogy if the next film gets a better storyline610,comedy
is the sequel to the 2012 comedy starring seth macfarlane and mark wahlberg the first film was an enjoyable story about friendship and that was mainly the reason i liked it and its sequel does pretty much the same thing only with a more serious tone aside from that it still manages its fair share of crude but funny jokessometime after the events of the first film voiced by seth macfarlane has married his girlfriend tamilynn unfortunately married life begins to take its toll on the couple as the two are constantly arguing with one another day and night in an attempt to fix their marriage suggests that the two adopt a child which tamilynn happily agrees to however in order for them to legally adopt must prove in a court of law that he is human and able to father a child tamilynn and his best friend john mark wahlberg hire rookie lawyer sam jackson amanda seyfried to help them fight their case which becomes highly publicised by the media as a resultdespite its more dramatic tone this film still manages some pretty funny jokes i enjoyed the parodies of civil rights court cases involving a stuffed teddy bear my favourite character in the film was sam jackson amanda seyfried the laid back but determined lawyer who wants to help win his case the films pacing was slower than the first film most likely to cater to its dramatic moments however i feel the films crude humour while not as frequent in the original would be very off putting to casual film goers also at almost 2 hours in length 115 minutes the film begins to noticeably drag near the end if you didnt like the first film give this one a missi rate it 710 the same score as its predecessor,comedy
is the continuation of the comedy that revolves around a grown man and his living teddy bear 2s humor and scope itself is very much like its predecessors as in it showcases a strong element of crude derogatory humor which feels fresh for the most part a main difference between and are that seems to revolve more around himself as he attempts to be recognized as a citizen the movie starts of very good and the dynamic between and john is as always the most entertaining part of the film the film does suffer a bit from movie tropes generafrom most sequels in particular the romantic aspect of the film the film also has many pacing issues certain parts of the film felt unnecessary and long were as some parts primarily the end of the film felt very rushed overall was an decent sequel as it harnessed much of the entertainment which was expressed in the first film however it undoubtedly had issues in regards to the pacing and common movie tropes which come with sequelsoverall 6510,comedy
pop culture reference overloadfor better or for worse is like an episode of family guy stretched out to two hours which makes sense considering the titular bear is voiced by the creator of that show oh and hes the director and coworker so yeahevery popular song movie and tv from the 80s and 90s is possibly spoofed or parodied here sometimes even with cameos from the original artistes but whats funny in small doses in a 22 minute cartoon quickly becomes tiresome when 9 out of every 10 jokes revolve around corrupting nostalgia and you may find yourself responding with a roll of the eye by the end instead of laughteras for the rest well what can you say its a heartrending tale of a man and his bear one is having relationship problems the other wants a baby in that order believe it or not they drink together watch animal porn smoke a lot of pot and throw apples at innocent joggers ho hothe film tries to make us feel for their relationship but im sorry all i saw is a couple of jerky pottymouthed manchildren who really needed to grow up and believe me coming from this reviewer thats saying somethingso which is better this or the original well the same way the new episodes of family guy are a climbdown from the first few seasons is inferior to its predecessoronly the decline is not so deep nowhere near in fact 510,comedy
in the eyes of the state you are not a person macfarlane has just got married and is truly happy when him and his wife decide to have a kid two things stand in their way one is obviousthe other is that is not considered a person now john wahlberg and his lawyer must find a way to prove he is a real person and not just a piece of property i loved the first one and was really looking forward to watching this movie i am a huge seth macfarlane fan and think he is a true genius that said i was a little disappoinin this movie it was very funny and i laughed throughout but it was just missing something the first one had some of the jokes are way over the top and shocking which is why i like it so much but some seemed a little forced this is still a very watchable comedy and if you liked the first one you will really enjoy this as well but it was just missing some of the magic of the first one overall a very funny movie that is worth watching but i dont think id buy it like i did the first one i give this a b,comedy
review this movie didnt have the same shock value like the first one but there are a few funny moments if you watched the first movie this movie just carries on from where and john were but john mark wahlberg has now divorced from his wife and hes finding it hard to jump back on the saddle is happily married to tammilynn jessica barth who he met in the first movie whilst working in a supermarket after living with tammi for a year has a massive argument with tammi but he still loves her and hes willing to do anything to bring back the spark after asking a fellow worker for some advice he decides to try for a baby and he asks his best friend john to be a sperm donor only to find out that tammi is unable to have kids because of her history with drugs they then try to adopt a baby but they are turned down because isnt classed as a human being and it kicks of a spiral of problems against his name after his marriage has become void and he losing his job he decides to go to a lawyer for help but as they havent got any money the lawyer offers his nieces services for free as its her first case because of samanthas amanda seyfried lack of experience in the courtroom they lose the case so she asks hot shot lawyer patrick meighan morgan freeman for his services he agrees to hear there case so they travel to new york to get his advice and hopefully get him on board after much persuasion and a run in with the evil donny giovanni ribisi from the first movie patrick eventually comes on board and he manages to get the case turned in favour its more of a serious movie compared to the first one but you still get the marijuana jokes along with explicit content i didnt find the black jokes that funny and i did find some of the humour a bit offensive but i did chuckle and some of the scenes especially when they play fighting and smoking weed there are some great cameos throughout the film like liam neeson jay leno tom brady and the voice of patrick stewart but it felt like it was missing something i wasnt left with that wow feeling which i got from the first film but it visually looked spot on it was good to see clubber lang and john teamed up again but if they come out with a 3rd movie they really need to introduce some interesting characters watchableroundup seth macfarlane 42 wrote and directhis movie along with supplying the voice of so he really did give this project his all some of the jokes did go a bit too far but seth is known for his warped sense of humour which you see in family guy american dad and his other hit movie a million ways to die in the west made a whopping 550million at the box office but this movie only made 215million which is still a great achievement because of the budget but it obviously didnt have the shock value like the first one did anyway mark wahlberg 44 has some promising movies coming out soon which include six billion dollar man were he will be playing steve austin and daddys home with will ferrell so hes got enough work to keep him busy for some time as for this movie he done a good job in terms of making it feel like there was a real talking teddy bear in the room but i still was expecting more from this sequelbudget 68milliom worldwide gross 216millioni recommend this movie to people who are into their comedies starring mark wahlberg amanda seyfried giovanni ribisi morgan freeman jessica barth with the voice of seth macfarlane 510,comedy
the story starts with getting married to tamilynn jessica barth you may kiss the bear the couple live in a tenement and bicker all the time as they throw crockery at each other and yell obscenities at their neighbours the film seems to be turning into a spoof of bluecollar movies about failing relationships and tamilynn have deadend jobs at the supermarket to get away from the feuding the teddy bear spends as much time as he can drinking and taking drugs with his best buddy john mark wahlberg who is now a porn addict living on his ownand tamilynn decide that the only way they can save their relationship is by having a baby which requires a sperm donor  and results in a lot of very smutty slapstick more serious problem is that the government does not recognise him as a person which means that he has no rights worse a creepy toilet attendant donny giovanni ribisi is hatching a plan to kidnap himthe writing here is often witty as devofriend wahlberg underplays beautifully and there is an engaging performance too from amanda seyfried as the pothead young lawyer who takes on casewhat is far less attractive is the way the film seems to sneer at the butts of many of its jokes whether theyre nerdish comicbook fans nurses joggers or the standup comedians whose improv routines and his friends take such pleasure in sabotaging,comedy
the magical teddy bear with the heart of gold and the mouth of potty is back in and so is writerdirectorstar seth macfarlanes mischievous mojo which went missing somewhere in last years mirthless comic western a million ways to die in the west a sequel to macfarlanes surprise 2012 smash 549 million worldwide is surely the last movie one would expect to find quoting from the anthropologist dawn princehughes writings on the essence of human consciousness but in its own sweetly subversive way this might be just the tolerance plea america needs right now  a movie that says in effect love thy plushie as thyself fret not such high mindedness has little diminished macfarlanes appetite for lockerroom humor grossout sight gags and bounteous popculture injokes which should make the seasons goto attraction for arresadolescent males of all ages and continue universals beary good summer box office,comedy
the us is widely regarded as a western democratic country but due to various pressurelobby groups some statementsattitudesapproaches have become widely inappropriate ie a smaller amount of people considers sth insulting and tries to influence the rest to ban it from use often successfully such stuff includes ethnicracial minorities sexuality obscene words physical looks etc but the result is often diametrically opposite  those dissatisfied with this lopsided freedom of speech are eager to show it in a blunt manner the other thing is the excessive use  abuse of the legal system which is costly and were the actual biggest winners are the lawyersjudges making fame andor profitthat is why both and have enjoyed commercial success in spite of rude scoffing at the topics above being a bit familiar with them i found myself giggling several times plus i have always wondered how mcfarlane succeeds to attract distinctive and good actors to his notsoseamless works in the movie in question eg amanda siegfried and morgan freeman and many celebrities making cameo appearances unlike in giovanni ribisis character was less elaboraless interesting and spent limitime on screentrue movies like are not for everyone but they could make you ponder on and over hypocrisy and that concealing ideas feelings and words would not make the real events and attitudes nonexistent for this  and some good performances  2 additional points from me at least,comedy
the first half of this movie is essentially a stripped version of the original we know the characters well now so we get straight to the gags the first hour is pretty much a perfect hour of comedy but unfortunately the movie has a lot of padding from then on donny was a funny character in the first one but did they really have to bring him back just to eat up some of the running time seth macfarlane is kinda limias a storyteller but the first one was perfectly streamlined and had a great ending it seemed like he was growing as a writer there but both this one and a million ways to die in the west bounce all over the place again so maybe he fluked out just take the bizarre way the third act is set up for example spends the entire movie trying to convince john to ask out the attorney and when he doeshes angry and runs away why because donny needs to kidnap him so when it comes to the story this movie gets kinda boring near the end but some of the jokes are just brilliant my absolute favorite scene is the one where they yell out sad suggestions during improv night its the perfect example of a random cutaway gag done right and macfarlane is still the king in that field,comedy
this is my theory seth macfarlane was getting high one saturday night while he was watching the marathon of star trek the next generation on bbc america for some reason they have the license now and they showed the episode the measure of a man one of my favorite ones by the way in which the android data participates on a trial to defend his rights as a free and intelligent form of life so a tenwatts focus was set on macfarlanes head and he said the measure of a bear and thats the way in which the screenplay of was born sure the affair of the trial barely covers one hour of the story so coscreenwriters macfarlane alec sulkin and wellesley wild had to add abundant comic tangents to inflate the film not to mention the abundant flashbacks and non sequiturs employed with an excessive abandonment on family guy and all of that is spiced with unexpeccameos and references to the popular culture which are funnier for their incongruence than their genuine humorous value examples jay leno roots jurassic park well the screenplay of even includes two musical numbers and a chase through comic con to please the fanboys im going to tell you what pleased me the most patrick warburton into the disguise i identify him the most all those are clear signs of a film desperate to try anything in order to earn the laughs from the audience on the positive side achieves that with enough frequency in order to bring it a moderate recommendation as a decent comedy which can go from a sincere dialog to the most grotesque vulgarity without losing its playful tone in big part thanks to the solid work from the whole cast highlighting amanda seyfried who brings her best comic performance since mean girls on the negative side the quantity above quality attitude fragments the story to the point of the incoherence but on the other hand made me laugh enough times to consider it a competent sequel which wasnt very necessary or makes too much sense but fulfills with its mission to make us laugh,comedy
i absolutely had a plethora of laughoutloud laughs in the first 20 minutes of the sequel to the very good predecessor film but i could not bear the rest of the movie with its ludicrous plot of struggle to be claimed as a person what the raunchy bear is now married to his cerebrallychallenged but easy on the eyes supermarket colleague tammilynn is still best buddies with mark wahlbergs john no not mark wahlbergs bathroom but the john character he plays who is best pal and thunder buddy john is now divorced and in a depressed state when finds out he is not being designaas a person he gets john to help his cause for im a person justice alongside novice stoner female lawyer samantha which by the way was portrayed atrociously by amanda seyfried writerdirector seth macfarlane who also voices did include a few classic hilarious raunchy scenes but macfarlane went way off the the far lane when he tried to drive into a plight for justice lesson learning movie it simply did not work and i hate to bear this one on you also but the bear has overextended his welcome into my cinematic world the novelty has worn off call me wicked but is the most disappointing but not worst movie i have seen so far in 2015 it just was not beary good  needs improvement,comedy
i seen this film on the last night of viewing in theatres in very happy that i got to see it i havent laughed as much before at a film especially this much in cinemas im my own opinion its even better than the first and i dont see many films that the sequel is much funnier definitely worth the watch for you people that like a laugh every actor did a good job in this film especially the main cast i love he cameo by liam neeson i laughed so much at his talent of acting in that small scene i also would like to say that i love how well it is wrote the writers have done an amazing job i love the concept of this film and main plot if you havent seen the first film watch it before it does matter in my opinion it is important but i seriously recommend that you all give this a watch i think i havent laughed as much to a film before,comedy
as always with sequels i was worried that it wouldnt stand up to the quality of its predecessor especially since i consider to be one of the funniest american comedies in years  i am very glad to say that seth macfarlane truly outdid himself as i found to be even funnier and smarter than the first film  having the story focus on problems instead of johns means this movie isnt a lazy and boring attempt at cashing in on the success of the first film by having the same storyline with a few twists im looking at you the hangover  this is a different more mature film albeit with the same characters that we love  there are still a lot of references to the geek culture and recent news events but these moments arent distracting i had a great time and laughed a lot which is exactly what this movie is supposed to do so well done mr macfarlane  810,comedy
i missed out on watching this film in the cinema but by lucky chance i managed to get this on you tube this film is just simply better than the original the two thunder buddies are back and better than ever set only a few years after the first film gets married to tamilynn while john is now single once again after lori dumps him is on the verge on chewing out his wife but gets advice that a baby will bring them closer together but sadly despite johns sperm donation tamilynn due to drugs is infertile so they decide to adopt but is deemed property and loses his job as a grocer and his marriage is null and void john and hire a young girl named samantha jackson as lawyer but loses the case they decide to go to new york to see the top lawyer but again lose the case and is once again in the clutches of his stalker donnythis film as i said is better than the first one but the film is a bit similar to dumb and dumber to especially near the end where john pretended he died to get back at after he tricked john into thinking he was retarded the film though was also a bit disgusting and a bit vulgar but of course this is a seth macfarlane moviei think it was disappointing lori was not in the film but samantha was not that bad and she was kind of like brian griffins ex girlfriend julian jelly bean as both are dumb blondes as in a running gag samantha doesnt know anything about pop cultureoverall the film was better and more amusing than the first one i am dying for a and i hope lori comes back,comedy
if you have watched family guy if you are familiar with seth macfarlanes prior works if you know the type of comedy he goes with this is a must watch you will fall in love with this movie from the very first minute guaranteed even if dont know who this seth guy is and whats a family guy chances are you will become a fan of his after watching thisfrom the start till the end this movie wont stop making you laugh whether by its pop culture references celebrity jokes or down right slapstick comedy its like watching a movie based in the family guy universe it doesnt shy at making fun of anybody or about anything this is one of those rare movies where the plot takes a backseat in lieu of the laughter riot going on but still its quite strong and makes a point sort of i dont know i might be high lolits perfect for watching with your friends on a weekend while you kick back relax and light up some of that buddha hidden away in the deep corner of your closet,comedy
the beginning was very weird and not nearly as smooth as the first movie was it felt like they tried to copy a lot of jokes and gags from family guy which didnt work out as well as it did on the show but was still enjoyable to some degreei was worried the movie was going to go downhill just like the first fifteen minutes or so but when amanda seyfrieds character was introduced the rest of the movie went perfect funny jokes memorable scenes  this is definitely something id recommend to anyone who enjoyed the first moviebasically this was a nearperfect sequel and im planning on watching it again very soon,comedy
the first was a good comedy film with a bunch of references and adult humour is exactly the same but just with a less appealing plot starts off very jolly with living a normal life and then he gets into a life changing dilemma that needs to be solved so he can return to that normal life the overboard humour was very well pulled off and had me laughing throughout most of the people enjoyed the sexual jokes in the cinema too probably classed very highly when it comes to execution of humour the only downside was some of the actors it looked very static and emotionless although definitely a hats off to mark wahlberg for performing so well in a comedy where he is partnered with a teddy bear overall it is definitely a film worth while watching im sure most people will leave with a few moments in the film that they thought was clevergenius,comedy
a sequel to the flatouthilarious is a fairly funny sequel but its not good as the first one reason the concept of the teddy bears pursuit to get the status of being a person isnt interesting enough  even otherwise we had a great teddy bear movie before synopsis newlywed couple and tamilynn want to have a baby but in order to qualify to be a parent will have to prove hes a person in a court of lawisnt boring its actually pretty funny  some sequences left me in splits this isnt a bad prequel from any angle but the problem is it isnt close to its highly enjoyable prequel seth macfarlane has made a good attempt to extend his teddy bear adventure into a franchise but its his own screenplay also cowritten by wellesley wild  alec sulkin that wears out after a point the jokes do work but only to a point macfarlanes direction is decent but his writing needed to be better performancewise the bromance between macfarlanes  mark wahlberg is still intact the bromance is undoubtedly the highpoint of the enterprise as both macfarlane  wahlberg are simply fantastic in their respective parts its also nice to see the beautiful amanda seyfried join them giovanni ribisi returns as the badguy but hes monotonous morgan freeman shines in a cameo on the whole does have its moments but not enough to be recommended strongly,comedy
i did not like the first movie at all i completely loathed it and found it an insult to everything imaginable with not even having a core message attached so i was extremely surprised to find myself crying of laughter at and i can only come to one conclusion from that and that is that seth macfarlanes comedy is direcat a specific age group and i just happened to grow into that demographicstarts with the stuffedanimalcometolife voiced by seth macfarlane marrying tamie lynn jessica barth whom he met at work in the supermarket we also have john mark wahlberg best friend thunder buddies who mopes around for a year because of his divorce from his wife played by mila kunis in the first film after the honeymoon stage of and tamie lynns marriage things start to fall apart really fast so in order to save their marriage they decide to have a baby and after an attempt at insemination and adoption is stripped of his human rights and is labeled property by the state of massachusetts this leads and john to sue the government for civil rights with the help of junkie lawyer samantha amanda seyfried there are also minor almost cameo appearances from john slattery and morgan freeman in supposed supporting rolesseth macfarlanes comedy basically consists of being as offensive as possible to everyone he sort of mocks when other comedies try to maintain a balance of political correctness and making fun of people so given that if youre going to see one of his films you have no right to complain that he was offensive because thats macfarlanes cinematic signature if we dont take the offensiveness and references to hitler and 911 personally you actually find the film to be very funny although as i said before the comedy is specifically direcat the young 1835 age demographic the pop culture and even political references were aimed for that restricage group alone to understand and so because of that if you fall outside the intended demographic you will be forced to look at the story for entertainment and the story is extremely lazy basically seth macfarlane who direcand wrote the film thought of a bunch of funny situations and figured out how to string them together which is why the film is a court movie road movie conspiracy film all at once so of course if youre forced to look at the films story you will hate the film but since when does one go to a comedy to admire the way the story was structured one goes to a comedy to laugh at funny situations and hey if the story is amazingly structured then all the better but its unjust to judge macfarlanes comedy differently than other general more conservative comedies in fact i almost admire macfarlanes comedy style its extremely risky and basically is begging people to criticize him for it and that is hard to do in the film world for anyonein terms of the acting i was very surprised by amanda seyfried who had been off the map of mainstream movies since les miserables i have to say that her role in this film is unlike anything i had seen before i was used to more conservative comedies like mama mia or even mean girls from her so when i saw her in this dirtier and certainly more vulgar role i was both surprised and impressed seyfried exposes herself to basically be made fun and she really holds out and almost accommodates her style of acting to the film and their respective actors so that she was one of the best parts of the film wahlberg acexactly the same as he did in and that means he was funny in fact i would argue wahlberg is more of a comedic actor than he is a dramatic actor certainly the only dramatic film he went above notable was in the fighter but he mostly shines in comedies as opposed to dramas hell even in the deparhe earned an oscar nomination for being the constantly angry and sarcastic police officer that was constantly ripping laughs from all of us as for macfarlane he was clearly having a blast voicing i only have the small tic of wanting to have seen more john slattery and morgan freeman but then again the trio of main actors worked so well on their own it might have been better to not touch anythingso in the end its kind of hard to evaluate this film i guess that if youre younger than 18 or older than 35 you certainly will not enjoy this film but if you are in that age group you will have a really good time,comedy
again seth macfarlane brings his offensive and cleaver humour to the big screen this time must battle for his citizenship against the world of course through funny disturbing and emotional turns along the way mark wahlberg also returns as lifelong friend and punch bag to pay for all the gag throughout the filmi believe the film is successful in narrative which i think the first one maybe was not so but both still tickle the audience with new hilarious and inventive comedyhowever i found the film to really be just a silly film with no real purpose with vulgar and repeahumour throughout so i would advise there be no further sequelsi still think the film is entertaining for the average comedy fan and to be little disappointing for them i give the film 610 and recommend it to all fans of the first film,comedy

i like to make a motion your honor i have to object to the claims the prosecutor is calling this a dumb comedy it comes to my belief that this comedy isnt as dumb as it looks amid all the crude humor that has the movie does have a somewhat smart premise while it does go a little overboard in being serious the movie puts out some good sly commentary on americas history of marginalizing people for being different while a lot of people might find this unappealing because they wanto see a silly comedy i kinda like comedies that kinda take a risk in putting out a social message this movie does bring up a nifty question what makes a person a person questions like are we only a person if we show empathy do we need to have to be responsible in the world and give something back or do we simply need to show love direcby seth macfarlane the sequel to 2012s tries to solve this by showing that voiced by seth macfarlane a teddy bear that came to live in the first movie is selfaware feels complex emotions and is capable of empathy still based on the law is deem property and denied access to the same rights as human beings in a quest to redeem his civil rights must seek justice and fight for the right to live without spoiling the movie too much the wanting to be human trial plot reminds me so 1999s bicentennial man in its approach i heard that the plot was born out of seth macfarlane reading john jakes civil war novels on the side while filming 2014s a million ways to die in the west it replaced his original smokey and the bandit 1977esque plot of and john mark walhberg driving a large shipment of marijuana crosscountry which he had to scrap after 2013s were the millers came out as much as i like the trial i would rather have the whole smokey and the bandit premise even if its a little farfetch from reality i have to say while the first movie made a lot of money didnt felt like a blatant cashin sequel a lot of work went into this film the movie kinda works it had enough satire pop culture references gross humor dark humor to make me very entertain all the humor hit the funny bone there were only a few that were misses still some of the jokes do look like they were rehash for this film a lot of them came from old family guys skits like for example the song that sings to prove he has soul is the same one brian griffin sang in family season 5 episode 7 brian the bachelor because of that felt like a series of skits woven together than real film the movie really needs an editor as i felt like the movie was a little too long honestly did we really need the weed farm sequence the road trip or the part where unneeded supporting characters rick michael dorn and guy patrick warburton bully the comic con nerds it didnt match with the rest of the film it had no pay off it felt like time waster filler another thing i didnt like about this film is the whole hasbro is evil subplot it wasnt needed if you want to technically based on the story hasbro did create but they dont theoretically own johnny mark walberg does so it doesnt make any sense i dont understand why hasbro agree to have their product placement in this film it makes their company look really bad companies like hasbro wasnt the only thing making cameos in the film famous people also pitched in i have to say the movie was a bit cameo heavy tom brady sam jones liam neeson and jay leno were all good but some of them were very pointless and wasnt needed the main cast was pretty wellrounded with seth and mark bringing back the laughs as the thunder buddies as lovable as these guys are they dont model behavior thats worth emulating i kinda miss mila kunis as lori collins she was the most grounded character in the first movie mila kunis could not reprise her role of lori because she was pregnant with her baby with partner ashton kutcher her lack of presence was very alarming i dont know why they couldnt write in that she was pregnant i hate that her character divorce johnny it made the whole premise of the first movie very pointless as the character of johnny is shown havent really growing up it kinda ruins the original film i have to say amanda seyfried as her replacement was alright as the loveinterest i didnt mind her character samuel l jackson i just wish they didnt bring back jessica barth i was never a huge fan of her character tammilynn in the first movie her character is very offputting and for them to add more scenes with her in this movie was nearly unwatchable giovanni ribisi reprises his role as the villain donny he was fun to watch but i really didnt think his character was needed like i said about the original movie this movie shouldnt be mistaken for a kids movie its very vulgar filled with foul language and sexual innuendo jokes are funny but its not too meanspirinot as much shock value as the first movie its pretty tame compare to the television shows that seth macfarlane creasuch as family guy american dad and cleveland show overall the movie does a good job at being a sequel but there were some questionable material that was spread a little too long it takes itself a little too serious at times but in the end its fun to watch do recommended,comedy
is actually not that bad of a comedy sequel the chemistry between mark wahlberg and seth macfarlane is still very good the jokes in the film are very funny there are some great cameos in the film especially from liam neeson but there are a few problems with this film one is amanda seyfrieds character i really didnt care for her character and i think they shouldve picked a different actress for the role or just let her character out of the story also the film does have some slow parts to the film and then it gets all serious also giovanni ribisis character also shouldnt have been in the film because he wasnt that funny in the film even though he was really funny in the first film if your not a fan of the first film or seth macfarlanes humor then your not going to enjoy this film but if you were a fan of the first film and macfarlanes humor then youll enjoy this sequel,comedy
seth macfarlanes 2012 was ingeniously hilarious to the max how do you send a barrage of racial and religious slurs and an avalanche of sexual jokes into the faces of the audience and yet draw no foul you make a teddy bear do it also knows how to tinge the sacrilege with a sweet bromance that takes the sting off it did it still have enough jizz for a sequel2s trailer lays out the new shenanigans and his manchild buddy are up to newlywed couple and tamilynn want to have a baby but in order to qualify to be a parent will have to prove hes a person in a court of law the idea is irrelevant ridiculous and preposterous but it is the perfect territory for seth macfarlanes brand of unsophisticapotty humour delivered with wacky powerwe were quite entertained with the movie and laughed out loud numerous times thats the mark of a good comedy but imho falls wide off the mark of being a great comedy it felt like the same old jokes repackaged some of the ideas are just too frivolously conceived for example to mend a marriage one would need to have a baby that didnt work for me finally this being a macfarlane vehicle it feels terribly selfindulgent and selfobsessed it felt like he wrote so many jokes and he couldnt bear with deleting any of them to make the movie tighter that made the middle act feel too long with too many redundant scenes and the jokes wore thin after a while thankfully it never loses its heart at the heart of it the franchise has always been a sweet examination of friendship loyalty and love and the outlandish plot wisely steers it back to its natural state with aplomball in all it is not a bad way to spend an evening we laughed because the thunder buddies are our pals too my wife did feel the franchise is at its end and she hopes doesnt happen i dont know about that it may be quite funny to see johnny and grow old,comedy
in this sequel is now married but cant conceive and seeks help to a donor so he and his wife can live a happy and normal life together but soon discovers that his privileges are denied by the society simply because in their eyes he is not seen as a human being but as a thing and now he must rely on his best friend to find the best lawyer and prove in court that he has the same rights as an ordinary manthis second film should not be made at all why because i see in it the same disgusting humor nasty words drugs and gross content that is not a nice way to make someone laugh i dont know whats in the directors mind and in the actors who appear in this when they present this to a large audience please stop this atrocity and dont make a third part enough is enough i dont know why i bothered watching because i know what to expect the hole movie is ridiculous from start to finish the idea is stupid a person is not 40 cm in height and surely is not a teddy bear one of the worst comedy of all time and nobody should ever waste the time to see it only if you have the brain of those who made it if you are one of the peoples that rejects all the things that are happening here or wants to make this world a tidy place you will close it after five minutes please dont make the same mistake like i did do not watch it dont tell anyone about it and if by any chance you have the dvd just throw it in the garbage where it belongs because thats what this movie is pure garbage,comedy
after rewatching i had high hopes for if seth macfarlane could conjure another film as satisfying as wed be in for a treat the cast were terrific with mark wahlberg seth macfarlane and amanda seyfried in the lead roles i knew we were in for an interesting comedy im not a big fan of mark wahlberg and amanda seyfried but this pairing worked very well in of course they had to have liam neeson in it and morgan freeman too whilst some of the jokes were sloppy some of the sexual references were funny as hell very crude and very funny sometimes i wonder how these sexual references and crude imagery onscreen actually passes as a 15 certificate but there we go overall an incredibly funny film a gag a minute hilarious comedy sequel id highly recommend it to fans of the first movie and to fans of family guy of course,comedy
when describing i can compare it to eating a second piece of a chocolate cake although it still tastes delicious its not the same as the first bite seth mcfarlane had a difficult challenge on his hands when writing a script for the sequel fortunately for him i am glad to say that still has those offensive witty and utterly humorous jokes and gags that still work as effectively as the first film so from the writing side of the table it seems that seth has once again justified his comical talent however despite the film trying desperately hard to build a storyline surrounding and his battle to become a human being in a court of law not only do you not buy it but you also dont really care the concept of the first film was rather simple it focused on the lifelong friendship of a man and his magical teddy bear that was it i feel like the second time around seth felt somewhat obliged to shove a disjoinstoryline down our throats and with the gang going from court to on a road trip to comic con it all gets a bit erratic and nonsensical amanda seyfriend joins the cast as a blonde weed smoking lawyer who aids john  in their search to prove is that of a human being shes actually one of the more quirky characters to the film and is a solid replacement for mila kunis there a few cameos here and there some hilarious some unnecessary overall fans of the first film will still enjoy the on screen chemistry of mark whalberg  but i think we all have to agree that this second outing lacks the freshness the heart  the charm of the first film an avid attempt at best with some redeeming qualities daniel cullinane,comedy
this wasnt too bad a sequel to it doesnt offer anything in the surprise departmentit uses lots of drug use and foul language the same as in the originalbut it does offer a different plot and new characters whether you liked the original or not will determine whether you like this one i think this movie was funny with lots of laughoutloud scenes with my favorites being the courtroom scenes the comiccon part and the scene in the law library amanda seyfrieds new character was terrific if you have time to kill and enjoyed the first movie you might like this movie 12 out of ,comedy
i really enjoyed this movie while the film in its formula and approach are almost identical which usually isnt a good thing for comedy sequels think hangover 2 this movie i find works really well in its comedy and in its presentationthe first thing that i enjoyed about this movie is that the drama is really downplayed there isnt really much focus on the antagonist and the climax is very short some may argue that this gives the movie less weight but honestly i love it when the drama is present it is pretty lame but once again its short and isnt the main focus id even argue that the main focus of this movie might not really be on the conflict either in which is trying to gain his citizenship an interesting idea in my opinion the main focus and drive of the film seem to be mainly on its comedy as a comedy movie should focus on the film also appears to not dwell on the love interest so much which is great the last film spend most of its time on it which is fine but it just seems like macfarlane didnt find developing this relationship to be as important which is also interesting how the plot of the last movie was also discarded its odd but not necessarily badthe acting is alright in this movie macfarlane and mark wahlberg reprise their roles as and john and do fine jobs amanda seyfried plays the love interest and is alright ive always found her to be kind of bland a lot like mila kunis sort of just another pretty face patrick warburton and michael dorn play gay lovers and are both hilarious in this movie morgan freeman does his usual role that makes you say well ive seen this 100 times but its still so damn cool the last note worthy mention for me is john carroll lynch twisty the clown and the husband from fargo who does a good job as the dick head corporate businessman the rest of the cast is all fine as wellthe comedic writing is back full force macfarlane still utilizes the same lame cutaway type jokes and in this one it might occur more often but the difference is some of these cutaways are hilarious the scene with the improve group had me dying of laughter and all the pointless scenes with michael dorn and patrick warburton are awesome especially the scenes at comiccon the scene with liam neeson might be one of my favorites in comedy history its pretty subtle too which is awesome and its written beautifully with neeson saying exactly what you want him to say but my favorite part of this movie by far is the ending if you havent seen the movie skip this section the ending of this film is brilliant one of my biggest complaints in the last film was the ending it was lame my cardinal rule for endings in movies has been and always will be that if there is an ending where a character is supposedly dead but then it turns out theyre fine and everything is ok is automatically an 810 or lower no matter how good the movie is its an awful twist and its pisses me off to no end however this movie did something that i really liked it made fun of it i was ready to give this movie a 710 just for the ending when suddenly it threw me a curve ball when john fakes his own death just to scare his friends and its honestly so awesome unlike the first one this dark joke fits perfectly with the tone of the rest of the movie and is a really good way to end things in my opinion kudos seth you got me with that onein conclusion id highly recommend this movie its certainly not for everyone as most macfarlane productions are its silly and childish and can be offensive at times but overall this movie is loads of fun and i think that just about anyone can find enjoyment in this movie also make sure to stick around after the credits for a hilarious continuation of a previously mentioned terrific bit i loved this movie and honestly i cant wait for,comedy
this movie is really really funny i have to admit it was supper entertaining though it got no moral or some cleaver plot or something but for me i guess it was made to entertain people and also i was laughing my ass off while i was watching it in the cinema and also the people who were watching it with me was like super duper hyped and i have to say the most awesome parts was the part when have sex with his girlfriend at work yeah that was so funny and he got promoto higher rank i was like what the freak man and also the part when samantha johnny smoke weed in the office and also the part when drive the car the funniest one was when morgan freeman saysjustin bieber i guess mrfreeman does indeed hate justin bieber,comedy
get ready for a mostly positive review on a hilarious movie why cause i am a fan of seth macfarlanes work and therefore is right up my alley as for anyone who dislikes the film or macfarlane then this isnt for youso the movie starts with getting married to his beloved tamilynn and after a year of marriage they decide to have children but with this will have to fight for his person hood as the state just now decides to classify as property although i do think this plot point delivers some intriguing questions it serves as only a decent backdrop to the humour we came to see and once again macfarlane delivers the jokes were very on point for me and it had me bursting with laughter as for wahlbergs character john he supports with this struggle but also gets a new love interest in the lawyer that has hired named samantha seyfried as a new addition i think she did fairly well and was a very likable characteroverall if you were a big fan of the first one like me then youll love the new one if you dont then i consider it your loss but thats just one mans opinionrating 910,comedy
since i really loved i couldnt wait to go see and i have to say it really exceeded my expectations ive seen several movie sequels that werent nearly as good as the first movie but this one definitely was it was hilarious from the very first minute the jokes were really clever and a lot of them came unexpecwhich is a typical thing i love about seth macfarlanes productions i also really liked amanda seyfried in this movie her character sam is hilarious and i bet everyone falls in love with her i loved everything about this movie the jokes the characters and also the message it sends which is that love always wins if you liked dont hesitate and go see this movie right now,comedy
when the first came out everyone raved about how funny it was i knew it would be dirty but sometimes a dirty comedy still pulls off funny although im not a fan of the stupid crude humour that has taken over comedies in the new millennium i was willing to give a chance andi was wrongor right it was dumb really really dumb and dirty and pointless despite an attempt at a heartfelt story still i wouldnt be a movie buff if i didnt try and watch the second film fans will be happy to know that nothing has changed only the story is even weaker than it was before this is a poor excuse at doing it all again because fans wanit i would even say it isnt as raunchy as the original but it is the same tired jokes pot smoking and lame storyline macfarlane is so much better than this but it feels rushed like they didnt want to do it but were forced to at least in the first film there was a genuine feeling of camaraderie between and john but that magic just isnt there this time around the sequel actually makes me appreciate the first film more and i didnt like it eithermark wahlberg is a great actor hollywood gold and he is good at comedy especially when hes doing satire so this should work well for him but his heart isnt in it this time he isnt likable and he deserves better character development than this seth macfarlane creaan adult legend in the foul mouthed pot smoking teddy bear had his fans but this just didnt add anything to the character a sequel cant just be the same thing again it has to add something new to the story and did not do that at all amanda seyfried is a bizarre addition to the cast she sticks out in this cast seems ridiculous and her and wahlberg have zero chemistry i dont think mila kunis was amazing or anything in the first one but compared to seyfried she was oscar worthy jessica barth is forgettable as wife they have a few amusing confrontations together but she doesnt do much else giovanni ribisi returns as our villain and he does alright its a pretty typical role for ribisi but it works well for himi would have expecseth macfarlane to at least bring the character back and put his all into it since he is the creator writer and director and stars in it maybe the film was victim to cuts and editing ordered by the studio but either way this film lacks a lot it seems to be liked by fans equally but it didnt bring in near the money and i can understand why i know im a bit harsh on comedies because i have an expectation of smart comedy and this is as dumb as it comes but it lacked in so many spots even more than the first and it didnt even have the same heart or dumb likability i would never purposely sit through either film again but especially this one 410,comedy
honestly i expecless out of this movie since it was a sequel i did not think itd be this entertaining both me and my friend thought this movie was better than the first though the first was great too i laughed more frequently watching this movie than i did while watching the first thoughnow if you dont like dirty jokes and are offended by harsh words this movie might not be anything for you personally i think that the movie is only better with the swear words and suchoverall its a great movie to both watch by yourself or with company mark wahlberg plays john perfectly even in this time and seth makes voice brilliantly this is a movie that you can watch several times definitely,comedy
the first film direcby family guy and american dad creator seth macfarlane was very good and very funny many people wana sequel me included so it happened and i was always going to see it basically john bennett mark wahlberg has divorced from his longtime girlfriend lori for six months and now his best friend since childhood living teddy bear macfarlane has got married to his girlfriend tamilynn jessica barth but following a year they are constantly fighting and their marriage is breaking down with johns advice and tamilynn decide to have a baby to preserve their relationship but has no reproductive organs at the same time is encouraging john to start dating again but he is reluctant and addicto internet pornography failing to find a sperm donor accepts johns offer to donate but and tamilynn is devastato find out that constant drug use has damaged her ovaries and left her infertile so the only option is for them to adopt a baby however this only ignites a barrage of law against because john wished for to come to life as a child and originally being an ordinary teddy bear he is classed as being property leading to the loss of his job his financial accounts and his marriage being annulled but john is determined to help his friend fight for his human rights taking the case to court they can only afford novice lawyer samantha leslie jackson amanda seyfried she is reluctant to take the case but the three bond smoking marijuana and work together to form a case meanwhile stalker donny giovanni ribisi is a janitor at hasbro toy company headquarters he is determined to make sure they fail convincing ceo tom jessup volcanos john carroll lynch if loses they can get him as property and study him to make other living teddy bears loses his case and is devastadesperate he samantha and john decide to go and see highly respeccivil rights attorney patrick meighan morgan freeman in the hope of overturning the courts decision so they head for new york they are delayed by a car crash but spend the night in a hidden marijuana patch it is there john and samantha get closer with attraction the next morning they meet with meighan he is sympathetic to plight but refuses the case he believes has not contributo humanity due to his juvenile and slacker lifestyle is angered and jealous of john and samanthas relationship and runs away followed by donny as he wanders into the new york comic con realises that donny is following him and calls john for help he and samantha arrive to help they save before he is cut open but donny cuts the cable holding up the model of the starship enterprise it is dropped but john pushes out of the way he is hit by the model and goes into a coma while donny is arresjohn is revealed to be fine at the hospital meighan watched on television that john was willing to give up his life for he reconsiders taking the case the ruling is overturned because has displayed self awareness feels complex emotions and can empathise with finally recognised as a person he reproposes to tamilynn they are remarried with adopting the surname clubberlang and they adopt a baby that they name apollo creed and john and samantha pursue a happy relationship narraby sir patrick stewart and also starring sam j jones flash gordon patrick warburton as guy star trek the next generations michael dorn as rick liam neeson as customer dennis haysbert as fertility doctor john slattery as shep wild ron canada as judge jay leno jimmy kimmel and tom brady wahlberg is still good being naive seyfried is a pretty new love interest for him but i preferred mila kunis and the rude crude computeranimateddy bear voiced and animaby macfarlane is still completely lovable look out for the many funny cameos as well this sequel is not as much fun as the first film mostly because it becomes too much about the civil rights and dramatic stuff so its not as lean and mean but it does have the man and his bear buddy to keep things together and there are enough moments to make you laugh when it should i was crying laughing with the scene inside the sperm donation facility so it is not a bad comedy worth watching,comedy
i saw the first and it really didnt impress me as much compared to other movies i seen there was a few laughs but it wasnt hilarious i am also a huge mark wahlberg fan i was expecting a lot from this movie judging by the trailers and the overall comedy from the first one what i got exceeded my expectations by a milethis movie was hilarious my dad and i could not stop laughing the whole movie the jokes were tear making funny and the stuff wahlberg and did and said were hilarious the script was great and seth macfarlane should be proud of his writing and directing i would also like to give credit to alec sulkin and wellesley wild for their writingunlike the first movie this one actually had a full plot the plot surprisingly had a good message and went along good with the comedy in this moviethe acting was great too like i said wahlberg and macfarlane were hilarious amanda seyfried jessica beth giovanni ribisi morgan freeman sam j jones and patrick warburton were all great also liam neeson was hysterical in his surprise cameoif you love offending laugh out loud comedy you will love this hilarious ride with wahlberg and macfarlane,comedy
if you liked the original seth macfarlanes 2012 surprise smash about a potsmoking pottymouthed teddy bear then you will probably like it is essentially the exact same movie and more  and less as director cowriter and star macfarlane offers a lot of the same kind of brash and ballsy humor that is his trademark nothing is off limits no one is spared so if you have a problem with a slapsticky pratfall involving scads of semen followed by a wildly inappropriate joke about sickle cell anemia followed by a crass kardashian reference and its a long way to go for that punchline then you should probably look elsewhere ill admit i laughed at that joke  and at a lot of the jokes in  but im also a longtime fan of macfarlanes family guy for its energy daring rapidfire popculture references and a willingness to go anywhere for a gag our child can recite verbatim the entire brian and stewie cool whip exchange were good parents along with fellow screenwriters and frequent collaborators alec sulkin and wellesley wild macfarlane throws a lot of stuff at the wall not all of it sticks but when it does stick it works like crazy as in his television work and the original some of the best bits here are the random non sequiturs flashbacks and fantasy sequences my favorite joke in the whole movie involves and his human best friend john mark wahlberg going to an improv comedy club to yell depressing suggestions to the performers on stage its a clever and bizarre idea wellexecuhaving said that is also overlong repetitive and selfindulgent in its attempts at offering a substantial dramatic plot line about civil rights alongside the raunchy comedy its reach exceeds its grasp and as in last summers ambitious failure a million ways to die in the west makes you wish there were someone around to rein macfarlane in and hone his instincts theres a brisk and irresistible 95minute movie somewhere in here but as is so often the case macfarlane cannot contain his excesses and it seems theres no one around him who can stop them either the delightful wrongness of the central premise remains strong however whom macfarlane voices in a thick new england accent identical to peter griffins has married his girlfriend gumchomping grocery cashier tamilynn jessica barth but john is now divorced from his wife mila kunis unseen here and in no time is having marital troubles of his own he and tamilynn make the alwayswise decision to have a baby to save the union but since is a teddy bear he lacks the equipment to impregnate her when trying to find a sperm donor fails to work  including a truly uncomfortable visit to tom bradys house in the middle of the night in one of the films many celebrity cameos  they try to adopt but then that doesnt work either when massachusetts state officials decide that isnt an actual person but rather a piece of property this leads john and to seek the help of young upandcoming lawyer and fellow stoner sam l jackson amanda seyfried who agrees to work pro bono to prove that is indeed a person the fact that sam doesnt know who samuel l jackson is  and doesnt get any pop culture reference these guys throw at her  is a reflection of the fact that she actually studied and immersed herself in the classics and didnt waste her youth sitting on her ass on the couch watching bad television macfarlanes detractors often accuse him of misogyny but as was the case with charlize therons character in a million ways to die in the west seyfrieds character is the smartest and most capable person in the room at all times forcing her into a romantic subplot with wahlbergs john seems needless but seyfried is game for whatever comes her way despite her comic abilities though seyfried is also stuck with some of the heavier material especially in long droning courtroom scenes that seriously bog down the films momentum macfarlane may try to liven some of these moments up with a spontaneous song or a profane outburst but its impossible to ignore the fact that this kind of meaty writing  this desire to say something important  is beyond him and his team connections to civil rights fights throughout history hearkening all the way to the atrocities of slavery seem poorly planned and tenuous maybe hes aiming for satire but he never truly hits his mark but wait theres more features another subplot in which donny giovanni ribisi the creepy dad from the original tries to kidnap the bear at new york comiccon to present him to the head of hasbro john carroll lynch as the basis for mass production nothing in this story line is ever funny or suspenseful it could have been jettisoned entirely begins in much more lively and promising fashion than its eventual ending however with a weddingthemed busby berkeleystyle production number during the opening titles thats beautifully choreographed and hugely entertaining as in the first film the integration of this computergeneracreature in a liveaction setting is seamless this is yet another sign that macfarlane needs to make an oldschool musical next  and hopefully if he does hell invite some seasoned folks to help him make his ideas truly sing,comedy
when i originally watched the first film i thought it was hilarious as hell so i was very eager and excito see this one only to find out that this film was a big disappointment now i have to admit that i did get a few chuckles out of this film but for the most part just wasnt as funny as the first film and a lot of the film focuses too much of being a serious story and thats one of the biggest problems with this film i dont mind that its got to have serious parts in it but it really was lacking in real genuine comedy which the first film hadi just felt was a really poor sequel that was just very mediocre film and disappointing,comedy
a few years after the first movie marries tamilynn and john and lori had already divorced one year later little family is falling apart a colleague suggests to have a baby john accompanies to ask sam jones to be his sperm donor but he refuses next john and sneak into tom bradys house and try to give him a hand job but they fail that too john asks why didnt ask him first says that he didnt want to further upset john knowing john hasnt gotten back into the game after lori so the next day and john visit the fertility clinic where john donors his sperm and they make a mess of the clinics rejecsample inventory but then the true hardship comes as appeal to adopt a baby is denied due to the state doesnt recognize him as a person only a property this brings further bad news as also loses his job and gets his marriage annulled and john then sues the state for civil rights complain but due to having no money they only get a pro bono junior lawyer samantha jackson first theyre reluctant to see sam but they feel like theyre the same as soon as sam smokes pot to ease her migraine they do the homework of researching and building their case in which time notices that john and sam gets closer to each other however they lose the case and the state deems as a property meanwhile the villain from the first movie donny plots with hasbro executive jessup to kidnap again since hes now just a property sam asks help from a well known civil rights lawyer meighan so they go to new york to meet him on the way their car crashes since sam lets drive john and sam gets even closer and kisses for the first time while they wait for the next day in new york meighan states he cant help them the angry leaves john and sam and heads to ny comic con but there donny tries to kidnap tagain johan and sam manages to save him but donny rigs an exhibition property to fall on john pushes away and gets injured the incident is recorded on the buildings cctv and spread on tv meighan sees how is saddened by johns injury and decides to take the case for them they win the case and remarries tamilynn and adopts a baby boythe story gives a new take on comedy its fresher to see comedies particularly ones as raunchy as this franchise to take on the more serious subjects of civil rights movements and still keeps it funny its a very nice timing that the movie gets released at the same time as the us sureme court ruled for legalization of gay marriages in 50 states yet even with the movie piggybacking the movements spirit with the lelgalizetwitter campaign it didnt seem to really connectstill i think the move nice retained the predecessors sense of humor in its original level and taste of raunchy and corny jokes and references the movie gets nicely balanced between dialog jokes and the more practical comedies whereas the first movie seemed more practical in jokes i see the one liners get even funnier in this movie i laughed hard when makes a reference to a kardashian while john has his accident at the fertility clinici also enjoy how the movie inserts so many cameos references and even recreate scenes from other movie and tv shows these indeed add at least some giggles to your laugh provided you know the original source the name play on sam is also quite a thing since the movie makes sam as blind to entertainment history or iconic characters the appearance of worf is really funny because its being played by the original actor himself the acting in overall is still at the same level as the first movie its nothing special but it can cover for the need of comedy mark wahlberg nicely reprises his role and manages to stay quite the same with first john seth mcfarlanes voice acting also didnt decrease as he can really crack laughs with raunchy one liner and references amanda seyfried turned out to be not a good replacement for mila kunis as she cant really grasp the character and give it enough liveyet 2015 is still a satisfactory entertainment for me it scores a 7 out of 10 from me and a recommendation goes out to you who can handle raunchy comedies or just eager to know about how the story continues,comedy
is the completely unnecessary and unwansequel to a much funnier and better movie than its sequeldont get me wrong there are still plenty of laughs to be had in this movie it is not a complete letdown i just think that it really didnt need to be made as the previous one pretty much ended up on the right note and there was no need to revisit the charactermcfarlanes writing and gags still work skills honed during the longrunning lifecycle of the still funny and biting satire that continues to be family guy mcfarlanes love for show tunes and old school hollywood musical extravaganzas also continues to be present which is a mixed blessingso while the movie is not a complete throwaway it is first of all too long like an unnecessarily expanded family guy episode the movie is all over the place trying to be a parody a gaggrossout comedy and at the same time a serious courtroom dramalingers and meanders especially during its serious portions which could have easily been cut out since the movies plot is pretty much redundant and is only there to service all the jokes and gagsand just a word of caution to mcfarlane in his quest to be edgy and show that yes i went there type of humour some of it falls flat at times and ends up feeling and sounding just meanspiriand even offensive which is not a problem of comedy but it is a problem of comedic timing and lazy writingmila kunis mcfarlanes longtime collaborator and i would guess muse is nowhere to be seen in this one and while amanda seyfried is a decent actress most of the time she is just doesnt add much in this instance her chemistry with mark whalberg whose part has been reduced to that of second fiddle to flatlines at the outset and is nowhere near what whalberg had with kunis there is a more plausible connection between and tammylynn his former girlfriend now wife played by a most welcome returning jessica barthin so far as the cameos in this movie some are funny and some wholly unnecessary at times it feels like mcfarlane is showing offhey look i know all these people and i can get them into my movieseth mcfarlane is undoubtedly a talenindividual actually multitalenand somewhat of a renaissance man and was a worthwhile debut for him as a comedic director but in his almost manic and often frenzied maddash to convey his creativity to the rest of us mcfarlane can end up allovertheplace as evidenced in a million ways to die in the west and now 2i think set mcfarlane would benefit from a creative circle around him people who can talk him down and when needed rein him in and teach him that sometimes more is not always better,comedy
2015 out of 4 when wants to adopt a child with his wife the government steps in and says hes not a human it turns out the government sees as just a piece of property so his best friend john mark wahlberg and a lawyer amanda seyfried try to prove hes more human than people thinkif you enjoyed then youll probably enjoy this sequel which is just more foulmouth jokes aimed to offend as many people as they can we get pot jokes homosexual jokes black jokes take off on movies like raging bull and the breakfast club and we also get sexual jokes sperm jokes and there are a wide range of cameos including tom bradyas im sure you already know theres certainly nothing oscarworthy here but im pretty sure seth macfarlane wasnt going for an oscar when he made this film the bottom line is if the movie is funny then it works and left me laughing extremely hard throughout there are so many jokes that are just so funny that you dont mind overlooking the various flaws including the film running way too longi mean its rather funny seeing someone like wahlberg get high on pot and then turning terrified wanting to find his home seeing wahlberg spill sperm all over him is funny if that sound disgusting to you then maybe youre not the target audience for this movie but if you like the type of lowgrade humor then theres plenty to enjoy here,comedy
ill keep this short because my problem with the movie is a very simple one we are watching a movie whos plot revolves around a drugaddicfoulmouthed heavydrinking teddy bear no matter what to me there is no other direction this premise can go then being allout silly but the teddy is in court trying to prove his humanity when the villain from the first movie because this is a 35 year old that has nothing better to do then hunt down a sentient teddy bear that is surprisingly never used as a joke tries to kidnap him again for the company that made him to use i also see they dragged morgan freeman tom brady and liam neeson in extended cameos theyre never anything funny and if there is a slightly smaller problem then trying to shoehorn drama in a plot that quite frankly shouldnt need shoehorning in its that hardly any comedic situations are taken advantage of in such a way thats funny theres a scene where theyre at comiccon and a joke is that 2 gay people at wedding that was annulled in this movie are there dressed as the tick and worf and they just beat up nerds like stereotypical high school bullies pray to god youre laughing at that situation because its there for around about 10 minutes of the movie in my opinion though at the end of the day i think it just boils down to too much creative control on seth macfarlenes part he write direcproduced and starred in this movie and part of me thinks that he really shouldnt be given all those roles no matter how talenor untalenhe may be,comedy
is obviously a bigbudget spectacle that is it is trying to leave that impression when in fact its ordinary vulgar comedy that targets an audience not very high intelligence therefore it is sad and a bit surprising to see there the great actor morgan freeman who plays a great lawyer select a movie like this in old age is not so clever move though i doubt that filmmakers of said him that the film mainly revolves around teenage imbecilic jokes about ds semen and st also promoting marijuana guess is popular among the moronic masses and with occasional dosage of slapstick positive emotions this movie actually trying to connect and mix much better british paddington with moronic american hangover and fails because its still stupid movie for teenagers about the st and ds largely for that american audience strongly raised in these moronic movies late years,comedy

in 2012 seth macfarlane took a hey wouldnt this be funny concept and stretched it into something special  a delightfully funny quotable and sometimes even sweet story about a teddy bear who came to live in 2015 he delivered us a sequel that pretty much no one wantedthe most irritating part of some sequels is that they make canon things we dont want therefore ruining the first film as an experience here john mark wahlberg who is it just me or is he perpetually flexing in this movie is in a slump after inexplicably breaking up with his loving wife lori mila kunis off screen this pretty much makes the first storyline redundant the scraps that macfarlane leaves of the first one are then reappropriain this movie in the form of the completely unnecessary reappearance of giovanni ribisis donny whose subplot ultimately has no effect on the overall story and john set out to restore civil liberties when he is no longer recognised as a human the film doesnt by any measure succeed as an inspirational law film though which would be fine if there werent a few scenes where it felt like they were trying to perhaps the fact that their lawyer sam l jackson  a joke included for the one joke in the trailer  is a pothead has something to do with that surprisingly sam has perhaps the only meaningful moment in the film with an opening argument so eloquent and even moving that the law student in me was nodding approvingly kudos whoever wrote that but i dont watch for complex legal drama i watch it to laugh and the film does that pretty well the humour is typical family guy humour  cutaway scenes to certain events random celebrity cameos and pushing the boundaries a scene where reacts to neil diamond was a small one but very funny shouting out sad suggestions to an improv team had me rolling around in my seat a wickedly funny and selfmocking cameo by liam neeson was the films absolute highlight a lot of the other humour falls flat in a tirade of penis pot and poop jokes wahlberg doesnt look very lively and his relationship with generic love interest sam is extremely forced during their first kiss scene i felt like if i swivelled the camera around id see macfarlane lounging in the directors chair shouting ok action now you kiss guys john slattery is tremendously wasas the supposedly neverlose lawyer ron canada confirms black stereotypes everywhere by playing generic black judge 234954 morgan freeman cameos as a distinguished civil rights lawyer which would impress me if the great man didnt appear in pretty much anything that paid  who fixes all the films problems nicely with a few minutes of speaking in his buttery voice okay look id probably give civil liberties to an xbox if morgan freeman asked me to point takenis in a word inconsistent  its got at least one profound moment and three or four big belly laughs but the rest of it is so unremarkable that id have been happier without it,comedy
the obvious theme of is the expansion of civil rights in america the film opens and closes with cometolife teddy bear marrying fullsize sexpot tamilyn between those ceremonies is stripped of his legal status as a human he is defined as property therefore disqualified for a job credit cards bank accounts and marriage he can even be abducand cut open without legal recourse the plot aligns fight for recognition with americas stuttering battles over civil rights from reluctantly accepting the humanity of blacks and women to accepting gay marriages the films structural theme is the celebration of pop culture as wins acknowledgment of personhood the film exercises the recognition of popular culture as a valid form of artistic expression an art as capable of serious statement eg civil rights the triumph of personhood over objectification as is traditional high art the spectacular pretitle busby berkeley musical number and the climactic chase through a comic convention clearly establish pop culture as the films arena of interest neophyte lawyer samantha is characterized as woefully ignorant of pop culture whereas and friend john at least have the verbiage to play at being lawyers and villain donny are drawn out of hiding by their reflex responses to pop songs cameo appearances by liam neeson tom brady and the saturday night live crew confirm the focus on pop culture and after all pop culture is as american as the  ever unending  campaign for civil rightsrelationship with john replays the bromance genre in american film the two love each other but are careful to exclude any homosexual implications both have women in their lives john the spectre of his exwife and his tamilyn theyre repelled by samanthas phallic glass hashpipe  a schlong bong  but weakens he adopts rocky opponents as his surname and his adopchilds name johns fake death is guyplay an insensitivity to emotion that samantha properly finds horridbut despite that macho pretence and and johns swaggering sexual profanity  theres a curious innocence in marriage he and tamilyn love each other despite his not having a penis that only becomes an issue when they try to save their breaking marriage by having a child deploying johns semen they are thwarby tamilyns sterility love without sex  that innocence evocative of andy hardy and the decades of romantic abstinence  puts this raunchy vulgar romp into the tradition of antique hollywood significantly is pantless through most of the film because  like donald duck and his disneymates  hes asexual when starts his legal fight for personhood he wears a green tie thats the bud of his human clothing at his triumphant trial when hes declared human hes wearing a full suit he has adopthe ritual wardrobe of the human however in his case unnecessarytheir probono lawyer samantha in her first case comes on as too hip for the law at their first meeting shes swearing and smoking her waterpipe  an augur of her fit with these irregular clients though she loses the trial she is validaby what she is a caring feeling person the good woman is a good lawyer even though she lost as the unbeaten lawyer opponent is ridiculed for being too slick to care similarly the civil rights champion morgan freeman who initially refuses case because hasnt done anything for anyone changes his mind when he sees the love between and john thats the crux of the civil rights controversy in america people deserve full rights not because of what they have done or how they are classified but because they are human beings this film should be required viewing for judges scalia and thomas not that it would help them theyre impervious to even popular culture,comedy
i was always going to be going into the first as a fan of family guy american dad and just seth macfarlane in general i can remember first hearing of the premise of the first film this being some time before the trailer had come online and having no idea what to make of it and when i saw the first red band trailer and seeing appear on screen for the first time and seeing a character that immediately reminded me of stewie griffin roger the alien and with the voice of peter griffin i knew this would be seth macfarlane a director who was stepping into the live action medium for the first time at what we have come to think as his best and the end result being the first a comedy that pretty much became a huge hit has come to prove that this was the casethis time round the story while still living up to the rude crude over the top nature you would go in expecting takes more of a somewhat and i really do mean somewhat serious and a elaborate turn while of course this is still not a movie to be taken to seriously it does contain a number of social commentaries and in a number of moments point out how modern day prejudices are not that different than those of a few centuries ago while family guy in the past has caused a number of controversies with such satires in this movie the characters only state such moments in history in a way that says although it should not happen again it could easily do so think brian griffin had a similar storyline where he wasnt happy about being treaas a everyday house pet but what these moments lead to is a plot that is more elaborate and actually felt much longer than it actually was this is not to say that i thought that is dragged on actually the pace was just right but this still makes for more of a buddy picture than the first was as we explore more of the relationship of mark wahlbergs character and his beloved childhood teddy bearthis relationship is something that helps the humour of these two movies i cant imagine the kind of imagination it would take to spend the most part of a movie like this interacting with what would have most been a voice behind the camera something that is to very much the actors credit but this movie does gather a great cast delivering their own spin to the kind of daft nature of the movie but the return of the villain of the first movie wile still serving more of a key role and serves some kind of purpose felt questionable in his purpose and yet he also feels just as if not more underplayed than he was throughout much of the first moviebut all these thing still make for a excellent funny as hell and very heartfelt sequel as is usually the case it does not quite top the original but still makes to be the kind of second outing you would hope it would be it is definitely more for those who loved the first movie and will probably not disappoint them either so in all i did really enjoy this movie i had a lot of fun watching it and would go out and watch in a heartbeat,comedy
at first i thought this movie was going to be funnybut i was completely wrong this movie is one of the funniest movies ever made the first one is better but this one still had me standing up clapping and laughing so hard i nearly cried the movie had chuckles followed by gut busting laughter its a good combination between comedy and action some action happening in the end but comedy lurking around every corner mark wahlburg and seth macfarlane have such a good fusion amanda seyfried and morgan freeman are just a bonus this movie is absolutely hilarious i highly suggest this movie to any family guy fan or anybody looking for a good laugh,comedy
a very worthy successor to the original with a fine plot in the best seth macfarlane manneri dont miss mila kunis at all she was a horribly bland character what we have is a swell buddy comedyroad movie with amazing banter impeccable comic timing and an uncompromising approach to its humor but never douchey about it not a lot of attention is paid to the real problem horrific marriage but its a comedy so thats finewe also get what is at times a riveting and poignant drama on the nature of personhood,comedy
2015 though many critics hawas a personal favourite film of mineit was the film with a much more expanded story and comedywhat makes you love this film is its directorial style which is unique to seth macfarlanehe makes it very funny referring to the american media and culture in a satirical way some of its characters are so fun it is like comedy genre when it reminds you of the family guy and its funny and quirky perspective way of looking at the comedylike the prequel this is so much funbut it is not for everyoneoverall  355,comedy
a little bit worse than first part but still slaying with its jokes,comedy
this movie and the way its made is not regular and you will notice it from the start the quotas and other things happening in this movie is different from all the movies youve seen,comedy
some really good gags and ideas in the first 30 minutes but the following story didnt work well to me it could have been a furious comedy,comedy
in this film attempts to gain citizenship or person hood he marries tamilynn jessica barth and is represenby young attorney sam l jackson amanda seyfried a person void of pop culture referencesthe film was laugh out loud funny with many people in the theater roaring with laughter there was not a dry eye in the house yes the film is crude and contain many fbombs however i feel different about this film than the first in they were crude for the sake of being crude with the humor being secondary in this feature they were crude for a good laugh they didnt cross the line in this feature although they hugged it a few timesthere were numerous appearances by celebrities mostly playing themselves i think the role of morgan freeman would have been funnier if samuel l jackson had played the part he could have worked in some of his famous lines i am also disappointhat they did a comiccon convention and didnt have a funny cameo by stan lee liam neeson tom brady and jay leno in funny cameos good one to watch with an adult crowdguide plenty of fbombs crude talk no sex nudity kayla delehant,comedy
it might fool ignorant people but the film is not relevant it tries wayyy too hard to be cool and it ends up being one of the fakest film scripts and characters i have seen in a long time makes the kardashians feel real anycow the film has no soul but tries hard and tells it in your face that it has so there is no subtext and the whole time they are telling you what the themes are with dialogues and it becomes simply boring it is one of the most boring films on earth the jokes are fine tho it should of been a bunch of sketches or even a tv show but on film it simply didnt work the plot is all over the place if theres any the antagonist is there for like 3 minutes in total it just did not deserve a film the story was too thin and not worth telling the first one had something to say this one should of been a blog article,comedy
i have to confess that while watching i laughed out loud  something i rarely do when watching a film  more often than i did during or any other film i can remember for many years the dialogue is fast and snappy and although much of it doesnt hit the mark when it does it is hilariousyes the characters do things noone would do in real life but then in real life noone would have a talking teddy bear however i did find the relentless cruelty and bullying by the gay guys from star trek a little over the top and unnecessary likewise the almost constant drugtaking it seems almost expecthese days that any hollywood film will have most of the main characters constantly taking drugs and i dont really know why noone has suggesthat this might not actually be helping young people wean themselves away from drugs  it really isnt helping society oh look all the people we look up to and who earn lots of money are spending almost every day drugged out of their minds yet they seem to function perfectly well cant be anything wrong with it then ill bet the drug barons are rubbing their hands with glee every time a hollywood film rolls off the presses these days and yet more characters are seen snorting lines of cocaine as though it is the most normal thing in the world by all means have and john smoking weed now and again but its all they seem to talk about and pretty much every time they stood still out came the apparatus for another hit too much they were perfectly funny when they werent smoking they didnt need the drugscertainly didnt need all the swearing either  completely unnecessary and the sign of lazy writing i dont know why writers think by adding the fword into sentences where there is absolutely no need for it eg how about we get some effing breakfast makes it any more entertaining to listen to people dont all talk like that it just makes the film less realistic and frankly depressingthe more films keep promoting incessant swearing and drugs the more people will start to think it is acceptable it isnt stop itapart from that i really enjoyed this film it didnt drag despite being quite long and although some scenes were a bit silly there were not too many massive plot holes or daft character behaviours and the majority of it worked,comedy
very similarly to part 1 is nothing more than a bunch of sex jokes and pop culture references mixed together not that it is horrible its just quite boring to be frank with certain exceptions of the occasional funny onelinersa very easy to watch film that definitely shouldnt be taken seriously as knowing the premise itself is already more than enough to determine where the story is heading have to give some credit for having a couple of clever pop culture references and its ability to make fun of the concept of the film itself i loved how they directly made fun of amanda seyfried even though she was part of the main cast a good addition to the already reference and gag based blendoverall just an easy to watch light comedy about a ridiculous talking teddy bear just like the first one it isnt any different and if you have seen the first part dont expect anything new here,comedy
was not as well received from critics and fans compared to this film is still quite funny with seth macfarlanes typical sense of humor using clever witty oneliners or cutaways with his typical musical dance screens which is often used although may not be as good as the original since this film is a little more depressing and light hearthe plot is still well and the overall film is very much enjoyable and entertaining the cast along with the supporting character all work well as this film does not feel as long as its runtime a little under 1 hour 50 minutes excluding end credits overall is still quite funny with many clever jokes and the chemistry between and mark wahlbergs character is what makes the film good,comedy
is a sequel not the first plot where we see the unique puppethuman duo on another drama sequence creating problems well this time they are encountering unexpecproblems cant spoil any the humor is finer in this one i liked this plot even more the same cast is back except for the blackhaired girl who is unreasonably absent in this one i disliked this and was somehow replaced by a blonde girl samantha just for the sake of having another love story take place this very aspect is both good and bad the ending of this one is much better and i like the idea this is no longer about some puppetabductor fools who try over and over to steal to me that is ludicrous its about some real problem law problem and i loved how it all ended7510  better than i would watch this one again ,comedy
first of all if youre reading this i assume you saw and enjoyed the first movie the good news is that has a lot  and i mean a lot  of the offcolor humor that characterized and johnny smoke weed a lot watch tv a lot and say fuck a lot if you thought was funny chances are youll find this movie funny as wellnow for the bad news while it has lots of good moments this movie does suffer from a mild case of sequelitis it doesnt fit together as well as the first movie did there are quite a few scenes that dont move the plot along at all and would work just as well as standalone comedy skits the movie also falls short of in a few other ways so lets figure out exactly whats wrong with this movie1 mila kunis isnt in it now technically this flaw applies to all movies that dont have mila kunis in them but in this case it makes a noticeable difference milas character was often the voice of reason in the first film and while amanda seyfrieds character in is hugely entertaining she is as goofy if not goofier than and johnny 2 in the first film and johnny were obnoxious and vulgar but essentially goodhearin our heroes and their friends seem to have lost their kind touch and descended into simply being unhindered assholes they harass strangers for fun cause at least two vehicle accidents and make one or two mildly racist sexist and homophobic jokes  hardly surprising considering mark wahlbergs past but still a letdown 3 for some reason this movie decided to try and be a legal drama as well as a screwball comedy while it manages not to get too boring there are still one or two courtroom scenes that feel out of place in this movie to the point where its a relief when the protagonists inevitably start shouting obscenities 4 there quite a few running gags that feel very forced and unnatural the celebrity cameos are also fun at first but get a bit old after a while 5 the ending seems a bit anticlimactic especially after the brilliant ending of the first film it mostly fits the characters but it seems tacked on and pointless and missed the obvious opportunity to be much cleverer than it was 6 they dont sing the thunder buddy songnow just for the sake of fairness let me point out some of the utterly brilliant things in this movie that make me love it in spite of its flaws 1 there are a couple of scenes that parody other films in utterly genius ways i wont name any names but if youre at all familiar with the biggest films of the 80s and 90s you should have no trouble getting the references 2 really comes into his own as a character in this movie the first film despite its name was really about johnny but in this one really is the one were supposed to identify with and johnny feels almost like sidekick more than the other way around 3 amanda seyfried is fantastic in this movie and manages to fit in perfectly with and johnnys weird rapport she has a few specific moments that really improve the film overall and while i wont spoil anything i will say that this movie would have mostly sucked without her 4 they dont sing the octopussy songin conclusion if you enjoyed the first i think youll enjoy this one it doesnt really work as a standalone film but few sequels do as long as you dont expect it to be better than the first film youll be pleasantly surprised,comedy
loved expecto be ok but am sad to report its plain bad did not have a strong plot but it was consistently outrageous and laughoutloud funny the gags in are not even loosely connecthe appearance of big name celebrities such as jay leno liam neson morgan freeman etc is mostly distracting not being american i guess some references are lost on me i found the liam neson cameo in lifes too short to be hilarious here its funny but forgettable im glad to see wallenberg and kunis separabut dont care for his new romance the giovanni ribisi subplot was the low point of why his character reappears in is beyond me and how did ribisi track the trio from boston to ny the finale at comic con sucks the nerd bashing by patrick warburton who is otherwise good is not entertaining there are still a number of laughs my favourite scenes were at the sperm bank and driving memorable funny deeply uncomfortable watch them on youtube but skip the full length feature,comedy
often when i watch comedies i accept that the movie is just going to be another brainless movie with excessively stupid jokes and absolutely nothing to get out of it i was pleasantly surprised by not only can you enjoy a lot of stupid jokes and have lots of good laughs you can also consciously or not reflect about moral ethics issues and reinforced good moral values i believe absolutely no movie should be completely brainless and no matter how stupid are the jokes theyre should some underlying good principles hidden in the plotwas a good comedy to watch perfect when feeling bored and you just want a laugh while being slightly distracperfect when you want to relax while not feeling dumbed down at the end of the movie this is probably the smartest a non serious movie can get while still consisting of mainly stupid jokes and one liner beside the movie remains as realistic as it can try to be for its kindi most definitely recommend this movie especially if youre in a good mood but bored,comedy
pretty much all that you need to know is that and are the brainchild of family guy creator seth macfarlane like its predecessor revels in crude humor the plot is about the wiseass anthropomorphic teddy bear voiced by macfarlane trying to get legal recognition as a person of course its an excuse for a bunch of stuff that shows us what people mean when they say boston tough along with nonstop pop culture references i should add i guess that we could be cynical and say that the purpose was to get more money out of a franchise maybe so but the movies purpose is to make us laugh and it succeeds pot bodily fluids and other types of low humor abound mark wahlberg returns as slacker friend and this time we have amanda seyfried as a lawyer trying to win case we also get a number of cameos basically its two hours of silliness with some mild social commentaryso yes we really are alone now,comedy
when i saw they were coming up with a sequel for i was well not exactly looking forward to more of the raunchiness and overblown use of expletives here they keep things colorful but manage to infuse some deeper thoughts and emotions to give it a stronger heart and the results are successfulopening with wedding and the absurdity behind such a relationship macfarlane throws in a magnificent reminder of what cinema can be with a musical number that explodes with creativity and is a great tribute to some of cinemas golden days berkeley is back in full color and its a lot of fun from that moment on we know si going beyond constant sexual references and this time we will be dealing with the problems with being rejecbeing an outsider feeling disrespecand most importantly trealike an objectthere are references to contemporary issues all the times and the fun thing in the movie is that challenges the audience to use both their brains and their hearts without forgetting whose dialogue is used to convey these ideas and company are not delicate and they love booze drugs and trashy comebacks its that this time theyre not the spotlight its not a cute transformation just a softer incarnation of what the characters have been yes there is stupidity but its not overwhelming like it was in the original instead it is used in layers and within references to other classic films characters and important political issues yes there are offensive words but there is a stronger heart herewe have attorneys of all types and we see how each kind is well not perfect and that makes the movie fun and even a reference to freemans voice reminds us how wonderful an asset to cinema for the last 30 years we can also see some stabs at pop culture throughout their visit to the comic convention which reminds us of how fickle a civilization is and how we take so much for grantedmight be stuffed animal that came to life through love and though he learned some subversive and impolite manners along the way he has a strong bond to those he loves and respects hes more of a human than some of the characters in the audience and this time his message is mirroring contemporary situations and some people might not be comfortable with the idea its funny how love even with perspective can conquer it all and still wink at us while it happensits not a perfect movie but a sure improvement over the original im still amazed at how real his expressions are i have seen oscar winning actors who cant even come close to showing emotions the way this bear did,comedy
there is no masterpiece here folks this isnt green mile its a movie about a drug using teddy bear i always rank comedy films differently than any other movie because to me all that matters is the laughs this movie packs plenty of chuckles as you follow the life of a peter griffin sounding bong smoking teddy bear if there was one major fault of the first it was that they made an attempt to make it a good movie what starof as hilarious turned into hancock and got mildly depressing but this time around they nail it the movie starts dumb stays dumb and ends dumb all while making me laugh to the point of tears this is why i view this film as much better than the first one if youre in the mood to laugh and you enjoy family guy type humor than you wont be disappoini certainly hope they stick to this formula and we get to see more shenanigans from the worlds most vulgar teddy bear ps morgan freeman is in it if you werent already convinced,comedy
is a funny cash cow with loads of cameos americana pot and filth but somehow the jokes arent as forced nor as political or religious as the original and the story is actually a little better as well mark and have better chemistry the second time around and amanda is a nice addition too i dont know if the jokes are that much better but the performances are an improvement if a bear can act he is a person i have to admit  i kept putting this off because i really didnt care for the original i just didnt feel a connection between johnwahlberg and his reanimateddy night and day here this while no godfather 2 or empire rises into the rarefied air of sequels that were better than the original filth aside the sequel just works better than the original in nearly every conceivable way if the scores dont reflect that then strike that up as the trend and not the realityi thought i was off the talking stuffedanimal movieboat but i guess im backon now i wont be as hesitant if were graced with a third film my opinionsure this wont help the helpful reviews 40100  57100hope it helps search your soul  you know it to be true,comedy
it is creativeit is outrageously funny and so not politically correct1 it has like any movies moments of pure comedy art and moments you realize the director screwed up i had a ball watching but i think  was of course much more spontaneous and sequels are sequels they are ok but they also need to pay the bills and if creativity is not happening again just stuff a lot of clichs in the movies and finish the freaking thing i wish was around when i was like 10 12it wasnt the closest thing i remember being politically incorrect and funny was the movie airplaneii back in 1982 i think there is opportunity to ted3 but it has to be bold enough to mock politicians religion and society again,comedy
i am very glad seth macfarlane and mark wahlberg decided to do i dont know and never heard why mila kunis isnt in this sequel its probably better without her because she always complained about but having amanda seyfried in this worked out really well i just saw this yesterday in the theater with my friends and we loved it a lot when you see the first couple minutes you think to yourself okay this is just going to be filled with big cameos and will be dumb its not like that at all the story really got going after the whole tom brady part i dont want to spoil anything seth macfarlane is a genius doing this type of movie you will laugh throughout the entire movie from beginning to end not only is this movie hilarious but it has a completely different story i guarantee you will leave the theater feeling great everybody keeps saying seth macfarlane isnt funny anymore i completely disagree i actually think his movies are really hilarious and have a story to be told in a good different way just like trey parker and matt stone do with south park i would definitely see this movie again and have already preordered this movie for my movie collection is a must see especially if you liked the first one if you do decide to see this dont forget to wait until the credits are over ,comedy
when marriage to tamilynn hits a rough patch the bear believes that having a baby might help bring the couple closer together again unable to father a child himself due a lack of genitalia tries to find a sperm donor eventually accepting an offer of help from lifelong pal john mark wahlberg however when tamilynn proves to be barren the bear and his wife turn to adoption which brings to the attention of the authorities who question the bears status as a human with help from young lawyer samantha jackson amanda seyfried enters a legal battle to prove that he not just property meanwhile tedobsessed lunatic donny giovanni ribisi makes a deal with a hasbro executive that puts the bear in mortal dangeris rather unsurprisingly more of the same a couple of hours of utter silliness featuring walltowall profanity politically incorrect humour and grossout gags with the novelty of seeing a cute teddy bear doing drugs and talking about sex having worn off a bit writerdirector mcfarlane compensates by making this second film even more near the knuckle including jokes about masturbation jizz 911 black cocks gays charlie hebdo internet porn nerd culture and a bong shaped liked a penis not all of the craziness work but although not quite as consistently funny as the original film there are still enough laughs to be had to keep the majority of fans more than happystrangely enough several of my favourite moments are amongst the least offensive the comparison of amanda seyfried to gollum is hilarious so funny to have amanda go along with the joke a three amigosstyle campfire scene involving a penguin and a lobster is too daft not to love and a brawl at new york comiccon offers up some brilliant sight gags,comedy
i dont know why i have spent 2 hours of watching it i liked the first part it was entertaining and funny but only teddy bear is cute but really jokes are clich lots of illogical scenes yes live teddy bear isnt logical as well but you get my point i hate the too fake musical scenes where a person plays the guitar sings and you can hear the goddamn drums which are not in the middle of nowhere i keep asking myself why they even made the second part of this movie because it has nothing to show just using the name but in my opinion it was enough of i really hope that they wont make the third or fourth parti wont recommend to watch it unless you need a background movie or something i didnt find this movie so funny,comedy
2if factory made toy bears could speak theyd probably communicate in their native tongue mandarinbut for some reason the talkative teddy in this comedy has a boston accentwhile john mark wahlberg is ready and willing to donate his sperm so his sentient stuffed animal friend seth macfarlane can have a child with his wife the us government wont allow this until lawyer amanda seyfried can prove he is a complex being with human emotionsmeanwhile archenemy giovanni ribisi partners with a toy magnate to massproduce the magical bear but first they must dissect himthe unnecessary and uncertain sequel to the grossly overraoriginal tries too hard to substantiate its benevolence and obvious liberal stance with viewers while trying too little to construct jokes that arent racist sexist or downright repugnantin other sociopolitical toy news dora and diego have just been deporred lightvidiotreviewsblogspotca,comedy
in the whole of 2015 i was dying to see a good comedy i came across movies such as trainwreck or wedding ringer or get hard but none of these movies were as appealing as this review is honest that in most parts of the movie it was funny as hell the jokes are fresh and very different from that of and in fact i think it has a better ending than too on the other hand it is a little more serious than nevertheless the humor of the movie is maintained throughout which is the purpose of a comedy this gave me as much laughs as did and macfarlane successfully delivers a comedy different and much better than the others in conclusion i think you should absolutely watch it and you will have a good time unless youre a boring a person who loves to criticize the hell out of things this movie is highly underraand even though im a man who hates comedies and i didnt like much though i loved the hangover 11 only and boratnot the dictator i highly recommend you watch it and have a good laugh,comedy
if you didnt laugh before it is best movie to laugh i know the movie for adult but it is different characters and i hope there will be and close these nice movie so relax and watch it it is defiantly worth a trip to the movies with friends mark wahlberg is the straight man and shows that he is one of the great comic actors as well show high performance in character this movie was so funny i was laughing so hard if you go to see this movie take your sense of humor and prepare yourself for politically incorrect jokes there are some pretty funny cameo appearances as well i saw this movie overseas and its funny to see people from another language and culture laugh so hard at american humor,comedy
2015 omg i had to come home and watch part one just to do a comparison is for sure as funny as part one not a bad sequel of course this movie is great for fans of family guy part 1 and of course anyone who is a fan of seth macfarlane now i have noticed many negative reviews on this movie and honestly im not sure what they were expecting to see if you liked part 1 then there isnt much to be let down or look up to yes this film and many within its genre are for the fans and people who are followers of this style and yes i can see where loyal fans can be a bit saddened but there wasnt more to do with this movie but continue it the way it was donewas funny for what it was and for it being the sequel it did compare to or held to be in similarity of quality and entertainment it did seem that the scripting was a bit short versus part one though part one had more of a story from beginning to end and seems to be more skit to skit till about the middle of the movie when it picked up still a fun filmi personally liked the best,comedy
to my friend and i we believe that the laughs were bigger longer and uncut until the 20 or so minute mark they become less frequent just jokes in general stop happening its not exactly what you want for every comedy but the court room scenes crs and scenes with the donny character give the audience a moment of pause and reflection only that moment isnt composed of enough or any laughter to fill time or to break the bleak mood of the audience the audience itself should serve only to enhance the film but damn when you get silence for a good 10 minutes it can feel like a job sitting there looking sifting through the crap youve already sat through the donny character could have and should have been revealed at the end when he unmasks himself at a con the convention is where a sht load of physical comedy punching tripping and the gripping of the 3 nippled lady proves to have been a time waster and a hell of a drawn out one now i remember the first and it having the same problem with wrapping up the plot in the last act but in this there are still jokes occasionally popping up which is appreciating where in the first one fell flat this new effort does make up fornow where this film could majorly improve would be in the crs it was the best scene in airplane ii because they filled the time with joke after joke after joke filed to the brim with genuine laugh out loud comedy in here they slip in or slap in rather maybe 5 10 jokes 1 of which comes out of nowhere and is off putting its to dry and muddled i dont know why seth macfarlane could not come up with anymore in these two scenes forget throwing anything at the wall to see what sticks he doesnt even wind up to give it a chance theres another film called serial mom waters where in a crs the jokes keep coming at you like a freight train it stays on track with the course and hits a few bumps along the way but keeps on a truckingoverall id put this up there with this is the end in that itll be funny once and youll come back to it later remembering the great canyon of no jokes and failed attempts but the ones that work work like brooks high anxiety it works as a one trick pony and beats out other show room horses that couldnt even reach the reins if they tried,comedy
overview as everybody knows there are not a lot of movies that cope with sequel syndrome shadows of the original and usually an underwhelming experience you get one of three sequel types those that come up with a new way to tackle the formula creatively and successfully those that borderline ridiculousness and disappoint or those that play it safe and go for more of the same mostly falls into the third categorythe set up is pretty standard marries his girlfriend tamilynn and they have a bit of a rough start to their lives together to try and give their relationship some meaning they decide they want to have a baby however it is revealed that by law is property and does not share the same rights as a human in regards to parenting a child and being married wanting justice they hire a young intern lawyer to fight in a court of lawfirst thoughts throughout the movie was i was generally laughing every third or fourth joke it kept me entertained and engaged however when jokes fell flat they really fell flat not so much some oneliners but even the comedic set pieces the slip that caused the shelf of sperm samples in the fertility clinic to fall on john just felt really bland not really any substance however the parting joke of the scene did make me laugh you re covered in rejecblack guy sperm just like a kardashian i also got this feeling in the opening credits scene with doing a instrumental dance number that just wasnt funny or interesting and went on for about five to ten minutes there was also a lot of recycled moments from family guy like the scene in the car where is driving dangerously to mess around by ray charles was done which is a reference to the great planes trains and automobilesthis leads me onto my next point of popculture references now i understand that you can make comedy out of modern day observation when done correctly like older seasons of family guy but there were times where it wasnt really a joke just a mentioning of something of relevance to today no context really there is one scene where john and the attorney samantha where preparing in a library for the big court case where they were dancing and goofing around and possibly a reference to a music video i didnt even know what it was but it was just so flat on the other hand there were sequences that did make me laugh and were used appropriately that ill touch on nextnoteworthy moments there were two moments that i remember distinctly for different reasons one was a stupid but funny scene where samantha sings a song around a campfire and all woodland critters come to watch her sing poking fun at some old and modern disney movies the ridiculousness of the animals that come to watch her was quite funny with the stereotypical rabbit bear on the other end a fish jumping out of stream and suffocating to listen and a random closeup of lobster it was silly but i have to admit it did make me laughanother scene was the big fight that took place during comiccon all nerds dressed up as different comic book and tv characters in a huge brawl it was funny seeing old dinosaurs from the very first star trek episode slowly swinging for each other and a man in a dragonball z costume trying to turn super saiyan it was funny and i enjoyed itperformances in all honestly the only standout in the whole film was mark wahlberg everybody else was just lackluster i dont really like wahlberg that much as a serious actor but he is really good in comedies one of the funniest moments of the film was when mark wahlberg smoked ridiculously strong marijuana and was scared to walk down the street without holding onto a wall he handled it really well and it seemed like he was tryingfinal verdict i have to admit when i left the cinema i felt moderately entertained nothing really standout or clever throughout the movie but it did make me laugh however almost every joke throughout the movie contained a pop culture reference some that worked and some that didnt but all the same it is just lazy there is no denying it there is no setup or payoff in set pieces things just happen because they do i do accept that it is all that seth macfarlane writes and he isnt clever enough to pull off a original concept with tight dialogue and wellconstruccomedy like ie trey parker and matt stone of south park but to award it any more than just an really average movie that i get some easy laughs from would be unjust was i satisfied for the most part i was entertained would i watch it again probably not,comedy
star rating  saturday night  friday night  friday morning  sunday night  monday morning has married his trashy girlfriend tami lyn jessica barth and they have now settled down together but not in to wedded bliss what with one thing and another but then settles on the idea of having a baby with best friend john mark whalberg acting as a surrogate father but then learns that he is not legally considered a person under the law barring him from adoption rights his right to work or even to enjoy basic human rights it all leads to a courtroom battle involving recently gradualawyer samantha amanda seyfried while the creepy donny giovanni ribisi returns hatching a plan with a slimy toy manufacturer john carroll lynch to make a brandweve certainly been assaulwith an onslaught of comedy sequels lately horrible bosses 2 dumb and dumber to hot tub time machine 2 paul blart mall cop 2 and probably some more and the quality has pretty much without exception not been anywhere near the standards of the originals and so into this midst the patently inevitable strolls with seth macfarlene back at the helm this as history should have taught us is not a cast iron guarantee of quality and while is a cut above a lot of what weve seen lately it still isnt quite as good as the originalmacfarlene has injecan even more merciless politically incorrect streak in to proceedings with this outing with some of the gags really making you feel uneasy and affecting how youll be able to laugh at them it challenges your offence threshold and what you might think is acceptable to the eye and mind somehow this time around the whole absurdity of the premise is a little harder to take as a grown adult too for some reason and basic human logic starts niggling at your mind but the ludicrousness also provides some of the best laughs in the script not necessarily from the character but some of the situations hes in the trouble is by the end its all become so drawn out with the whole back story of quest to be treaas human causing an unnecessary distraction and detracting from the main farceits all pretty much as good as can be expecwith some laugh out loud moments of joy but oddly no fart jokes but also a little tasteless and uneasy in parts and also a little blindsided by ambition ,comedy
despite a weaker third act this was a fun movie as usual with american comedies the first act was the funniest and strongest with non stop gags  if you like seth mcfarlane you will love these first 30 minutes some over the top crass humor throughout  again you probably already know whether or not you like family guy type jokes taken to the next level of vulgarity and below the belt humor a couple of cool cameos sprinkled in the movie performance wise you also already know whether or not wahlberg is your cup of tea but i was pleasantly surprised by amanda seyfried all in all i think i actually prefer this second episode to the first one perfectly fine for a lazy sunday afternoon and for a few chuckles,comedy
is a fantastic film with a very well written plot and a terrific comedic cast i am a huge fan of the first and i found this to be very entertaining if you are a seth macfarlane fan you will surely be pleased the comedy is still great i do not think i went through a single scene without laughing at least twice one thing i think this movie was missing that is very evident in the first one is mark wahlberg being in the lead role is the main character now which is fine it makes sense but i felt it was more relatable and funny to watch when we are seeing a real person dealing with this talking teddy bear instead of just seeing him in a supporting role though wahlberg does still bring in a terrific comedic performance the chemistry between all the cast members is fantastic the strange albeit beautiful connection between wahlberg and a cgi bear is still evident which is always a joy i was a bit skeptical at first that mila kunis was not in it but amanda seyfried helped me forget about her delivering the most impressive performance that i have seen from her in a comedy role the film is also jam packed with many great cameos that are sure to delight and surprise it is certainly not as good as the original but i do not think fans will walk out disappoinand i would recommend to anyone looking for a good comedy in order to adopt a child with his wife must prove that he is a person in the eyes of the law best performance mark wahlberg,comedy
ive been a huge fan of seth macfarlanes family guy ever since it aired so i was delighwhen he made  the tale of a foulmouthed but lovable teddy bear who came to life for no real reason and it seemed that the majority of cinemagoers agreed with me was a massive hit and i suppose in hollywood terms that means that a sequel is inevitableso the  not that imaginativelytitled  was born and from what i gathered reviews were mixed most said that it was okay  pointing out that there are parts that make you laugh but long areas where the jokes get a little thin others said that it was just a retread of the first one and not original enough to warrant being a classic in its own rightnow i loved the original i laughed all the way through so perhaps  because if the lukewarm reviews part 2 was receiving  i went into the cinema with low expectations therefore i was pleasantly surprised perhaps i should have watched the original just before the sequel  that way i could compare which one i laughed more in grani havent seen the first one for a year or so but i found i was actually laughing more in the second one than i did in the first mark wahlberg returns for the sequel and not being one to take comedic roles that often again does well to get the laughs especially when hes opposite the true star of the film  the computergenerafurry bear himself voiced in the style of family guys peter griffin by seth macfarlane the only notable absence from the cast list is mila kurnis who was unable to reprise her role as wahlbergs love interest due to her reallife pregnancy shes replaced by amanda seyfried who does well to airdrop herself into the mix as a blatant replacement love interestyes theres not an awful lot of plot character development or storyline but the jokes do come thick and fast basically if you like family guy or should i say family guys irreverent and often adult and vulgar humour then you should already have seen and therefore should appreciate its sequel if youre not really sure of the tone of the film and whether youll like it i suggest you look up clips of either family guy or online and see if youll go for this particular brand of humourdont be too swayed by the negative reviews perhaps you should allow yourself to lower your expectations as i did and find yourself pleasantly surprised maybe if i watched the original again id realise that it was in fact superior but im happy to have back and i think that it makes a great compendium piece,comedy
firstly if i was rating this movie id give it 6510 but imdb doesnt allow that so im going to have to go for 610the first half of is hysterically funny and i mean hysterically funny the liam neeson scene had me in tears it was so funny the sperm bank scene was brilliant for the first half legitimately brilliant jokes were being fired out left right and centre if i was rating the movie in two separate halves then the first would easily get 910 for the entire first half i was wondering how was getting such negative reviews then the second half starthe second half i would give 510 maybe 610 i dont write reviews often but the second half of made me so mad that i felt compelled i would consider the second half to be from when makes his first appearance in court onwards the movie completely lost its way and its quality plummefor some reason that god only knows the writers decided to turn into some sort of dramedy that felt more drama than comedy sure there were the occasional laughs but for the most part the movie became far too serious i cannot think of one single joke in the second half that could compete with anything in the first half the romance between john and samantha felt somewhat forced to me bringing donny back wasnt a good idea and the whole comic con scene felt stupidso to sum up the first half of is funnier than the entirety of however its second half takes a sharp downward slope into mediocrity in my opinion was a missed opportunity to make a truly great comedy,comedy
this is such a movie where we find a bunch of scenes  dialog that only suitable for adult viewers the plot is amazing we wont feel boringness for a single moment in my eyes its the most entertaining movie of 2015 all the characters did their level best but personally i wanna mention jecissas namei think shes the best of all her body language dialog throwing style her overall look is most appealing morgan  liam the two experienced guy did nice in short roles there is no need to say about mark though hes my sweet macho buddy and teddy oh no way and finally id like to say you must watch the movie and answer the question  is teddy simply a toy or something else i am waiting for the next story thanks ,comedy
thunder buddies john and are back and now we find married and john divorced however 12 months into their marriage and his wife tamilynn are at each others throats in order to try to save his relationship with tamilynn suggests that they try for a baby of course this isnt a straightforward process and the couple try many questionable methods to conceive all of this isnt helped by the fact that is told that he cant adopt a child because legally he is classed as property rather than a person decides to fight this in court whilst at the same time trying to get john back on the horse by getting him to hook up with their inexperienced lawyer samanthai absolutely loved the first film and knew that it would be a monumental task for this sequel to live up to my expectations whilst it doesnt quite hit the greatness of the first film it does come close and the good news is that its still very funnyit may just be me but in this sequel it felt like there was much less of macfarlanes quirkiness the first film was chocked full of it but here it seems to have been toned down a bit im wondering if macfarlane was perhaps trying to make the film more accessible in order to appeal to a wider audience i do like seth macfarlane and think hes an imaginative guy but ive got to admit when watching family guy i find myself shaking my head or raising my eyebrows as often as i laugh  sometimes his humour is a bit too weird and out there to make some episodes of family guy to be anything particularly specialmuch like the first film this film is pretty crude but unlike a lot of recent comedies macfarlane doesnt depend on crude humour in order to get laughs the scene with liam neeson is a good example of a funny gag that was clean as well the law  order mick take again shows imagination and creativity yeah macfarlane goes for the obvious sometimes but there are plenty of jokes that work without resorting to vulgarityas much as i loved this sequel there were some minor problems for a start at close to 2 hours its far too long and it does drag on occasions as a potsmoking lawyer samantha is a difficult character to care much about and is nowhere near as endearing as lori was in the first film  the chemistry between wahlberg and seyfried was also notably weaker according to the trivia section kunis declined to appear in the sequel because she was pregnant at the time its a bit of a shame because i liked her character in the first film and i think this sequel would have been stronger with her presence on a personal note i also think that shes easier on the eye than seyfried but thats just my opiniondespite the minor issues this is definitely worth checking out and i only starto think about the minor problems after i left the cinema i was too busy laughing to care when i was watching the film if you liked the first film then i guarantee that youll enjoy this sequel,comedy
who would have thought that seth macfarlanes creator of family guy first feature film about a potsmoking foulmouthed teddy bear would have made over 550 million at the box office back in 2012 i certainly didnt expect it but its the sole reason why we have the sequel to simply titled ill be honest with you macfarlane did a fantastic job with the first film making an r racomedy with heart and enough laughs that are still memorable today he even threw in some great cameos and nods to pop culture references much like family guy doeseven though the first film dragged a tiny bit in a few places and got off the rails it still was a very enjoyable experience a little later macfarlane made his comedy western a million ways to die in the west which had a few laughs but tried to hard to deliver every joke imaginable it was forced and not by using the force by any means that is more or less the case with although i did laugh almost from start to finish with the hilarious raunchy dialogue that is still topicalthe main problem with is again trying to put to many references and gags into a short amount of time there is no real benefit to it at all other than saying hey look theres that reference to that movie or actor while it might make for a quick second smirk or laugh it is almost immediately forgotten to get to the next pop culture reference and when you teeter on doing a few dozen of these in the span of ten minutes it becomes tiresomealso runs right at about two hours which is a little bit longer than the first film complete with the some slow moments that dont forward the film any but instead rely on overthetop laughs to get a cheap rise from the audience i dont mind that so much as long as theres a point but with this movie there isntthe story is good enough in the sequel which takes place a couple of years down the line where has married tamilynn jessica barth and john mark wahlberg is divorced from lori mila kunis from the first film trouble is brewing in the new marriage where thinks having a kid with tamilynn is the solution to their marital problems however he is not anatomically correct and cannot bear a child so they try a few routes which prove unsuccessful including breaking into tom bradys house and trying to steal his manhoodthey also try adoption which catches the ears and eyes of the government in stating that is in fact not a human or a person but rather property and is denied citizenship and forced to lose his job as a grocery store clerk and more importantly his marriage is not recognized by the state anymore this problem sets the tone for the rest of the film as and john embark on a legal battle to win his citizenship they enlist the help of newbie lawyer sam jackson amanda seyfried who is taking on her first case with which he is reluctant to have her represent him but when she breaks out a bong in her office and tokes up and john know shes the right onethrough 80s montages and a trip to new york to seek the help of the countrys best civil rightss lawyer morgan freeman is packed with laughs which ultimately ends up at new york comic con where all things pop culture collide in an epic battle including donny giovanni ribisi takes place first and foremost mark wahlberg is fantastic here in this movie he has perfect comedic timing and sells every line and action with an invisible bear he needs to do more comedy like this because he excels at itmcfarlane again has one of the best voices in america right now and is so believable and funny as the voice of that i cant help by want to listen more seyfried holds her own with the guys here as well and is always a delight to see on screen the 80s90s movie references were quite impressive so be on the lookout for those spielberg and john hughes moments throughoutoh yeah and id like to mention that michael dorn and patrick warburton are in as well and they bring a few surprises to the table is one of those typical comedy sequels that thinks that the bigger the movie is the better it is this is an aspect of sequels that is all too common and it doesnt always pay off still is rather enjoyable with tons of laughs maybe enough for two movies but it lacks the magic the first film had,comedy
i dont know what people are expecting here to be as funny as the first thats setting the bar very high with this successful sequel this comes pretty bloody close funnily enough i havent seen any reviews for this one outside of the imdb one wahlberg again a single but wanguy does what he does best in the first which is hanging out with his favorite teddy bear where the lovable crass hasnt changed again with killer comic dialogue in the hands of the reliable seth mcfarlane who knows comedy too whats impressive here with this sequel there more a story interesting and a sub plot too with that lovable bear encountering some hairy moments again being snatched by that psycho donny ribisi and i cheered when wahlberg smacked him out a grand moment at comic con wants to marry tami lynn which for some reason might eradicate the late night squabbles theyve been having bringing them closer together he also wants to give her a child there lies the impasse which thats only the start of their problems where is soon not seen fit to be considered part of the human race john and enlist legal help from a sexy lawyer seyfield adding a fresh romantic spark to the film where wahlberg and her getting it on was of course inevitablepredictable near the end too i saw straight through that gag with the dead lying wahlberger one thing that kind of irritame or i didnt like was with liam neeson as a nut job customer in store my only grievance with this film the fine morgan freeman his presence was greatly appreciaespecially in the resolution thats wrapped up quick in the wake of the sub plot ending with that psycho donny ill be honest this film came off better than i thought it would falling shortly behind its predecessor in the laugh department in some ways i love this better than the original so is a high 7 which ill have to take to an 8 mcfarlane has thankfully done us proud again thankfully for this successful sequel i almost wished i saw at the cinema you go get em now the third one awaits for fans of the first and others,comedy
i was a big fan of the first installment of and i find the second part to be hilarious fun for first 35 minutes then it gets carried away to boredom and johnny are amazing together but the lawyer does not fit in the group and sure is not funny at all the screenplay gets too weak and the laughter becomes few giggles i had huge expectations on this movie but i was disappoinplease see the movie for yourself to understand what i am talking about so much of potential has been wasi sincerely hope the third installment of this franchise as confirmed happens to be all fun mr k,comedy
is still funny if you dig the completely out there humor this has but it did lose a bit of its previous thunder song  pun intended you do get another song but i doubt very much that it will be as popular as the song from the first movie lightning in a bottle and other jokes to your liking can be inserhereone comeback is a bit too convenient but its nice to see liam neeson even if its only in a weird cameo role theres other people here and especially one couple is very over the top and might be a touch too much for some to watch dont forget though its just a movie the harassing those two do is borderline on the other hand the intrusion of a comedy club as wrong as it was was kinda funnyso high and lows all the way through you have to decide what side is winning ,comedy
the movie wasnt as bad as i though it was going to be it had some good jokes that got a laugh out of methe only problems are that there are a lot of weed jokes at a point they arent funny anymore and just annoying also there is a political message that gets shoved down your throat the entire moviethe surprising things were that the camera work and story was pretty good the movie looked really nice with some nice shots that caught my eye every once in a while the story was cool at some points it was predicable but for the most part it kept me interestedis a good movie worth a watch it was surprising how they were able to carry it on to a second movie and still make it funny and entertainingalso there is an after credits scene that is pretty funny,comedy
i cant believe some of these reviews on here these people need to get a life and learn to tip their cap to someone thats climbed to the top agreed family guy has definitely run its course a few years ago if you ask me but american dad in my opinion is the most genius and witty show i have literally watched every single episode as for and i just got back from seeing and there was at least five times i couldnt breathe from laughing so hard gransome jokes go a little far but that duo of wahlbergis just too good i also went into this thinking it would be another crap sequel but walked out pleasantly surprised and honestly if anyone sees it and hates on it it just makes me laugh cause i know theyre lying through their teeth dont listen to critics go see this movie 910,comedy
small spoiler review worth readingokay me as a review i was coming into this movie as someone who didnt want to watch it and they had me coming out devoto there series if youve seen this movie youll know what i mean the concept of a teddy bear turn bad isnt something youll see everyday and me being a fan of family guy was expecting a massive peter tumor in my brain however the tone in which seth speaks is something of a brianstewiepeter mix slightly off his original voice okay this is a small spoiler for my favorite part my favorite part which had me in stitches the first and second time i watched this was the first court seen that was amazingmoving on my overview the reason i rait 910 was simply because of some of the cgi things i saw may have been my theater however it was a tiny let down but oh my god the comedy was outstanding the reference where on pointmy ratings 910torrent it  cinema with large combo cinema with large popcorn and medium drink,comedy
from what i remember of the first film this one gave a lot more  the story was great and the whole film is full of clever little moments the humour is jumpy but thats a good thing for example they would joke about summin happening and then show it much like family guy would which makes for hilarious comedy the idea for the finale of the film is a clever one and unless ive missed something from some other film i havent seen it before  and for someone who is a fan of this idea picking up references everywhere was a fun added extra go see it worth a watch and doesnt matter a great deal if you havent seen the first one,comedy
kunis left i know obvious single guy easier than couple however apparently she didnt return because shes pregnant with ashton kutchers kid which is ironic since even without being in this shes involved with the child of someone dumb obnoxious inexplicably popular who refuses to grow up adoption to fix a failing relationship no way to do that without being heterosexual wait no being a person preaching doesnt have to be boring anyway no theres no plot and a lot happens that doesnt progress it this feels like the same as the first worsejohnwahlberg dumber and a major jerk so reversed from the great portrayal in the sweetandstandout original a mix which this messes up the heart tries to drive then the comedy wrestles back the wheel tries to help tedmacfarlane spreading and inviting hate directs with a broken arm writes along with the other two halfasleep and without restraint with a civil suit theyre joined by their lawyer samseyfried at times the straight man who doesnt know any pop culture other times game crass as them they bond over pot she tries everyone does so that she can get together with do i even need to say tamilynnbarth unstable and white trash gets some to work with albeit is only in about 50 of this donnyribisi as creepy and psychotic as before is back in the same role making less sense this time cameos are overused and oddly full of missed opportunities  as a lot else in this im not sure anything was cut from this except those two bits that were in the trailers which thankfully did not give away all of the best material albeit a lot of itwait youre still with me wow well i laughed like a lot when this works its hilarious thats one of three jokes the second you get without them getting even a smile or smirk from you and the third just falls flat im glad i put money towards this and sat down in a packed theater who were just as into it as i was im not kidding i stand by that yes of course i wish this was spared the earliermentioned problems the structure or lack thereof how this feels like a long cartoon episode has several climaxes and calm down periods and hope someone cuts it down of course that does bring up people complaining its two and a half hours feels longer than that i dont stay through the credits and i dont count previews these are things which id like to note are entirely possible to avoid i nowhen it starand ended this is 105 minutesthere is a lot of strong language grossout pardon the pun gags and its immensely meanspirii recommend this to everyone who finds that at all appealing 710,comedy
lewder cruder and ruder  ups the ante in typical sequel fashionas far as sequels to comedies go isnt half bad of course its no where near as funny as the first film by seth macfarlane  but who are we kidding did you even expect it to be the love lives of our friendly thunder buddies john mark wahlberg and have not progressed as one might expect john is now single and very much not ready for a new relationship as his web browser history suggests and and his busty babe tamilynn are no longer living in sin as they are recently hitched with the honeymoon period over in no time they decide to fix their marital woes logically by having a kid to fill the void but when has to prove he is a person in a court of law the problems just keep piling onso what do you get from a sequel of a surprisingly funny film about a foulmouthed teddy bear by seth macfarlane a story that is stretched a smiiiidge too far in terms of believability fewer quality jokes for cheap obvious jokes and infinitely more cusses and drug references as sequels go which are typically filled with new faces and recasts that are far less compelling keeps it to a minimum and the only addition amanda seyfried practically steals the show by keeping her performance realistic but out of the box from her other roles what you also get are loads of pop culture references and perverantics you wont want to admit to yourself were amusingits okay your secret is safe with us will be funny enough and makes up for it with celebrity cameos well admit it we were happily surprised by the film but its still hit and miss for us so we probably wont watch it a second time6510 please check out our website for all the reviews of the recent releases comedies and blockbusters,comedy

review by mike smith newlywed couple and tamilynn want to have a baby but in order to qualify to be a parent will have to prove hes a person in a court of lawmark wahlberg and seth macfarlane return for if you read my review for the first film you know how much of a fan i was of this one i didnt have high hopes im not a big fan of comedy sequels because they dont stand up to the first one but did the first film was more of a romcom but plays more as a stoner comedy like harold and kumarmost of the cast returns and the newcomers are awesome and fit right in the cameos are what made me the happiest including liam neeson tom brady jimmy kimmel but the best of all was jay lenothe story moves at a fast pace and doesnt feel like a 2 hour movie there are some plot holes but picks up right where the last film left off the jokes will keep you laughing throughout the whole film just like the first one the one downfall is that they do reuse some family guy jokes but to my surprise it doesnt take away from the film also they used cutaways this time around and i loved itjust like the first film the laughs are strong even though most of the first half of the movie was shown in trailer tisk tisk hollywood for giving so much away the cast is funny and awesome the only problem is both films kind of blend together but is definitely worth multiple viewings and is a really good sequel which is rare these days cheers and remember life wont suck as long as there is a good movie to watch9 out of 10 ediby samantha locke twitter fatmiketpk facebook page httpswwwfacebookcomfatmikesmoviereviews,comedy
whats great about comedy movies is you know whether or not youre going to enjoy it if you enjoyed the trailer as the film is just an extended version of that for me im a huge fan of seth macfarlanes comedy family guy maybe not american dad but the other two i think are brilliant the trick is and theres no way of avoiding this dont sit near one of those cnts that laughs at every second word i wanto actually kill him to be fair some bits were hilarious mark wahlberg getting jizzed on was not something i thought i would ever see imagine if this gets flagged for containing a spoiler now then again it wasnt exactly crucial to the storylinenice appearance from morgan freeman always nice to see amanda seyfrield was decent too this is actually the first thing ive seen her in since mean girls im not really a les miserablesmamma mia kind of guyoverall decent movie i feel like it knows it stands in the category of silly comedy but is able to sit at the top of that chain mainly because it can jump to serious at the drop of a hat end of the day there are some serious themes about civil rights in there its just heavily discarded by the penis shaped bongs,comedy
continues with the story of the foul mouthed teddy bear tedseth macfarlane who was wished to life by johnmark wahlberg in ted2012 marries the love of his life tamilynnjessica barth after a year of marriage the spark between the couple has been totally lost  theyre constantly arguing so they decide to have a baby to hopefully fix their broken marriage however is told he cant have a baby because he is technically property first will have to prove he is a person in a court of law john  enlist the services of up  coming lawyer samanthaamanda seyfried is an outrageously hilarious film its more shocking than its predecessor people who are easily offended will hate this movie however that is seth macfarlanes style of comedy absolutely unapologetic when i first heard macfarlane was making i thought it was a completely unnecessary sequel however im really surprised to tell you that i liked this film better than ted2012 the most refreshing aspect of this followup to the 2012 smash hit is that hardly any of the jokes  gags from the first movie are repeathe american court where fights for his civil rights is a hysterical setting for the outlandish  john this sequel turns out to be necessary because the story concentrates more on while the first film concentramore on johns story mark wahlberg is brilliant as john seth macfarlane is the highlight of the film as amanda seyfried is a welcome addition to the cast as samantha the fact that samantha is more similar to john  than loriplayed by mila kunis in makes her character way more interesting  funny jessica barth is great as tamilynn giovanni ribisi is amazing as donny morgan freeman is spectacular as patrick meighan sam j jones is good as sam jones patrick warburton is awesome as guy michael dorn john slattery john carroll lynch  ron canada are impressive as rick shep wild tom jessup  judge respectively liam neeson is outstanding in his cameo as the customer is a must watch for all seth macfarlane fans,comedy
if you enjoyed the first movie youll definitely enjoy this one it had about 3 laugh out loud moments and i dont remember the last time laughing that hard in a movie theater the movie starts off at a good pace and with good humor but slows down a bit in the middlethe end and i can see how seth macfarlane purposely slowed the pace down and focused on certain aspects of the movie to try and reel you in so you get more emotionally attached to the characters didnt quite work for me but the laughs were well worth it there were some great cameos and plenty of mainstream analogies go in with no expectation and youll enjoy it,comedy
the original was one of those movies where you watch and realise you already saw the best bits in the trailers and other clips i enjoyed it but overall i had a feeling of disappointmentbut this sequel i absolutely loved and i was giggling shrieking or doing a mutley every couple of minutes for almost the entire movie my eyes were stinging with tears of laughter by the endbrilliant stuffnice soundtrack tooi must check out the original as i now feel i may have missed something,comedy
the original gave us the story of a lonely boy named john who wished his stuffed bear would come alive jump forward a couple of decades and the cute kid had become a layabout 30something mirrored by his foulmouthed horny buddy aside from the unusual central pairing the setup was a typical bros versus hoes comedy it had its moments and made half a billion so heres the sequel and for me its the slightly better filmjohn mark wahlberg is now divorced from lori while seth macfarlane is just married to tamilynn jessica barth when the teddyhuman couple goes to adopt a kid it draws attention to the fact that he is not human  hes technically property john and newbie lawyer sam amanda seyfried set about taking the case to court asserting that ability to love is proof of his human statusif this sounds like a sentimental setup thats because it is what we have here is a strange mix of puerile humour and long monologues about what it means to be human at the films heart is a very sombre message which is hard to swallow when borderline race jokes run up against dead serious reminders of americas history of slaveryas with the first movie your enjoyment of the film will largely depend on your appetite for the family guy breed of comedy i was personally pleased with the sequels more solid plotting and unusually weighty themes but still lessthanenamoured with the bullying tone of some of the humour its hit and miss the sperm donation clinic sequence is hilarious the celebrity cameos less so theres a great scene which amusingly alludes to both jurassic park and contact but then patrick warburton returns as guy and his alpha aggression marks the movies nadirfor a scatcomedy macfarlane goes beyond the call of duty as director combined with the brilliantly bouncy orchestral score think john williams in chase sequence mode with sweeping cranes and dollies and plentiful cityscapes macfarlane evokes the formal aesthetic and adventure spirit of classic 80s family screwball  albeit with dirtier gags i like how characters meeting for the first time dont show any shock at his form which shows admirable resistance to the modern comedy nuisance of selfreferencethe hasbro subplot in which donny giovanni ribisi returns as a disempowered toy company employee doesnt really go anywhere and basically exists as a very long buildup to a final fantastically cruel gag involving a lethal starship enterprise its a decent joke but by then youll be feeling the overgenerous runtimeis a worthwhile sequel sporadically funny and at times oddly thoughtprovoking fans of the first wont be disappoinand latecomers to the party can easily jump aboard its combination of vicious humour and cuddly moralising is jarring however  a pity because a more inclusive script which wasnt at war with itself might have made for a great modern fable,comedy

my girlfriend and i took advantage of the kfc special with ice cream and entre and salad and had a great time watching melissa is so good and talented and jason is a real man mmmmm delicious,comedy
you want lame you got ityet another oneliner laden supposed action supposed comedy why is it needed why to fulfill release quotas of course and either deliver quarterly revenue targets or tax write off accounting line itemshere again we have a complete nincompoop ignoramus incompetent fool who is neither funny nor action packed deployed to the film by domestic american spooks yes it is xxx xander all over again except where xander was a tattooed trash this one features a flatulence fanatic in love with herself no wonder russia rules and is winning and has captured the executive and half of the legislative branchdumb movies like this result in a country where the president praises the country that financed the 911 hijackers and gave us bin laden and attacks the general who lead the mission to kill bin laden or embargoes iran which fought on the ground to defeat isisi have nothing more to add,comedy
kingsman the secret service started a beautiful new wave of james bond satire films its been done before but never quite as meta as it was in kingsman actively referencing how similar the plot and archetypes are to james bond while still having a refreshing novelty factor and interesting characters of its own  creating this whole new world for the overthetop james bondesque adventures to take place while the real james bond canon continues its serious grounded story arc while kingsman was about setting up this elite organization and showing off their penchant for ridiculously elaborate action sequences has little exposition and throws you right into this hysterical world where jude law is the super suave secret agent and melissa mccarthy acts as his eyes and ears back at headquarters jason statham comes in later as a rogue agent who is as arrogant as he is oblivious the movie doesnt itself seriously but it never goes into parody territory these characters as overblown and ridiculous as they are still have relatable personalities and youre willing to go on this crazy adventure with them right from the start is very much an action comedy  whether you view it more as an action movie or as a comedy is completely up to you i found it hilarious within the first minute and was laughing heartily throughout the entire movie but theres no denying that the action sequences are incredibly well done specifically the fight between susan cooper mccarthy and a female assassin in a kitchen the opening sequence of cooper alerting bradley fine law where enemies are while fine sweeps them up in a rat maze full of baddies and the scene with the car where cooper mops the floor with a handful of terrorists with little to no effort if you arent laughing at the jokes you can laugh at how insane and overthetop the action is  either way its an incredibly fun timewhat i find most compelling about is how likable each character is its not just mccarthy law and statham with a bunch of stoic supporting characters no even the supporting characters are hilarious and interesting miranda hart plays coopers goofy friend who does dumb things with the best of intentions rose byrne plays the villainous daughter of a rich terrorist and has some excellent backandforth bickering with mccarthy and peter serafinowicz plays aldo a sleazy frenchman who absolutely loves women and especially their boobs they all have moments of hilarity even the main antagonist played by bobby cannavale who is supposed to be a classy businessman has quirky oneliners and the funniest villain run ive seen in recent memory oh and 50 cent is in it playing 50 cent yeah its as crazy as it soundsas far as lead performances go this is the funniest melissa mccarthy has ever been this is the ideal role for her because her character has a serious job and a serious mission juxtaposed with mccarthys snarky personality and usual shenanigans making for some truly hysterical situations jason statham however is the real highlight here the man is brilliant in this role hes a toughguy agent that goes around bragging about how badass he is and goes on to do the stupidest things ever while still keeping a straight face and menacing persona  essentially a parody of his usual roles his rants are comedy gold simply because its statham doing them he proves here that hes not only one of the greatest action stars working today but also one of the funniest the fact that he even agreed to this movie says a lot about stathams attitude  hes a great sport and isnt afraid to make fun of himself and i really hope this earns him more comedic roles in the futurewas everything i wanted it to be and more i laughed harder at this movie than i did at most comedies in the past decade the production value was fantastic the pacing was perfect and director paul feig clearly knows how to do comedy but now can add action to his resume everything about this movie works it also allows james bond to continue its serious endeavors kingsman to handle the classy yet gritty side of secret agents while focuses on the campy and silly nature of the whole affair i sincerely hope this gets a franchise because there are too many great things happening for it not to get a sequel on its own however is an absolutely brilliant perfectly casted satire that should not be missed by fans of action comedy or fun,comedy
much as people want to watch their scifi dumbed down in the form of michael bays transformers it seems that the modern cinema going audience at least in america anyhow are content with paul feigs fecal offerings im astonished to see this movie running at 7210 at the time im typing thisi can only assume that movie is made for twenty and thirty somethings who have failed to grow up are generally sheltered from life and are intellectually limited i thought bridesmaids was bad enough by it seems that feig has gone full out on seth macfarlanes vulgarity style but with even less subtlety than macfarlane himselfwatching this you think youre in for an entertaining james bond spoof sure enough the first five minutes sets that up nicely it what follows is a disgrace in short this has the potential to be entertaining but it is ruined by a constant barrage of vulgarity the thing is that unlike movies of the past that have had vulgar elements in them say blazing saddles the vulgarity is delivered without comic timing and without any level of subtlety quite simply we see things like the normally wonderful alison janney saying the f word constantly and then hear her utter words like thunderc and were told its funny because hey its a swear word this goes on throughout the picture from the initial scene with statham to a plane exchange between mccarthy and rose byrne where the f word is literally uttered in every possible sentence im not a prude i swear like a trooper and potty humour is funny to me most of the time but when it gets to the gratuitous and unsubtle extent to which the film presents it i feel that my intelligence is being insultedthen there are it seems the other requisite elements to american comedies these days namely fart poo vomit and sex jokes the whole scene with the faked erect penis which we needed to see not just once but at least five times for it to be clear to us that we are meant to laugh just made my cringe like i have never cringed before then you have vermin crapping on a chocolate cakebecause har har har isnt it funny to see a background character eat a fecal laden treat when not being vulgar the picture goes to every length to denigrate the appearance of mccarthy and miranda hart with routine jokes about how they arent that attractive or how mccarthys weight is a reason for her characters undesirable place on the social and professional ladder to think that feig has the audacity to claim he makes these films to support women and that anyone who disagrees is a sexist unrealif you could get rid of the above then there is the bones of a half decent comedy there are still a few funny scenes most of which dont rely on the shock and vulgarity factor but it seems that feig cant help himself and just cant take a measured approach i shudder to think what he will do to a beloved property like ghostbusters slimer with a rubber dick and poo jokes no doubt well based on his offerings so far i wont be going to see it but the real tragedy here is the amount of cinemagoers who now seem to think this one brain cell trite is fine entertainment it is ultimately not the likes of feig or michael bay who are the death of intelligent creative movies its the morons who line up to lap it upand frankly they should be ashamed,comedy
i just watched the first half of this movie on recommendationit is just dreadful its a long string of expletives unfunny situations and terrible acting you know when the movies has lost it when the dialogue is just insults expletives and nothing elsei would certainly not recommend this title to anyone and putting it in the comedy genre is doubtful to say the least there is very little storyline basically a copy of true lies which was a far better movie and it fails on all scoresthe level of this movie is best summarised by one of the scenes showing pictures of an erect penis from a recovered camera hilarious for a sniggering teen possibly,comedy
after fife minutes watching it was clear to me that this is jet another failed attempt to create something of a british action comedy dont get me wrong all the necessary ingredients for a good movie where there great actors great music great camerawork and even a decent storyline nothing really new but hey  this is hollywood  if you cant think of a new story just recycle some old ones over and over again american scriptwriters never get tired telling the rest of the world how stupid we are my greatest disappointment were not the infantile dialogues the ever extensive use of the fword you really have that covered and the sexual innuendos you should really practice it more and talk less about it  it was the actors namely jude law and jason statham dear mr law and mr statham you should really stand above such bad filmmaking dear filmmakers you had so many good starting points to make a entertaining film  but you did what you always do everything over the top take a hint and watch some european genremovies they will teach you how to do it,comedy
yawn yawn yawnsitting through the vulgar language and bad acting in this move made the 150 i paid seem like too much moneymelissa mccarthy can be a funny talented actor but she seems to have to resort in playing parts where she uses extremely vulgar language making her look untalented seamy and stupid the inane vapid humor in this horribly scripted movie filled with obscene vulgar language actually made me angrydont waste a minute of your time or a penny of your money on this bad movie,comedy
really the frontal anatomy reveals and extreme cursing and anatomy references are over done since hangover the shock value is non existent and it is not funny it is rather disrespectful to the fan base to believe that the only thing the 18 and up crowd will laugh at is a crude bar joke aside from the obvious parental warning i would also have to add an iq warning as well the underdeveloped plot left nothing to be desired a film without suspense is basically a third grade writing assignment the characters were not believable or likable seeing another tammy movie where the audience gets to laugh at a fat woman for being fat is in and of itself laughable considering the american obesity rate the fact that we never see a movie where obese characters are able to demonstrate their acting range outside of an occasional moment where said character pines over an attractive costar and maybe despite my obvious repulsive weight this person sees beneath the lard layers boohoopass on this trash,comedy
terrible in all its glory fat jokes because it stars a fat chick terribly degrading melissas persona one would think that the movie actually adds something with that cast but it doesnt it not only has the last minute unexpected hero recipe but the im fat so i make fat jokes ingredient the movie was almost unbearable to watch and very american style of laughing at steriotypes its sad to see that jude law and jason statham participated in this since they have so much more potential and thinking that they wasted time filming this and not something of quality makes me sadthis movie is whats wrong with society nowadays do not recommend,comedy
my daughter told me this was a funny film so i watched it i will never trust a teenager again i forgot that teenagers will laugh at a fake willy joke every time and this film does the same showing a male member is faintly amusing the first time but by the fifth time its just boring i made myself sit through the last hour because i had hoped it might improve it doesnt the first ten minutes are by far the best it drops off a cliff after that puerile profane badly acted hamfisted and just really unfunny the dialogue is appalling the action sequences are ludicrous and the obsessive swearing just gets old very early on dont watch this if you have a mental age older than six adam sandler would be ashamed of this movie avoid no seriously just dont watch this tripe,comedy
parodies of films arent exactly the freshest thing off the boat at least not since the 1980s and even then it played old real quick dramatic films are often unintentionally funny  people look back at them and say they arent bad films because they were of a different time or maybe because other things in the movie triumphed the few corny scenes of the flick but as good as a dramatic film is a funny one can be even better especially if its got that 90sloving meta quality to it funny films mostly translate into selfaware comedies which are praised often immediately whether they are good or not theyre terrible but because the creators meant for them to be that way its supposed to be funny all right fair enough it seems to work for paul feigs anywayis a film that despite being made after a thousand different parodies works why maybe its the unconventional but still hilarious lead melissa mccarthy maybe its jason statham playing a bumbling goon a screwup of a maybe its the no limits humour of paul feig puking on a dead guy the crowd at my cinema seemed to eat it up apologies for that phrasing me i liked jason stathams real speech more i mean who would have thought that the science teacher from sabrina the teenage witch would actually become a decent comedy directormay be a lot like other film parodies in certain ways such as mocking the theme during the opening credits of the film  quite an obvious gimmick but enjoyable nonetheless if you happen to catch some of the lyrics of feigs interpretation however melissa saves the genre from the mistake of unfortunate castingi recommend this comedy to anyone whos a fan of melissa mccarthy and even those who arent jason statham fans may revel in the fact that he is actually quite funny in all of his scenes,comedy
overall this movie is great and i would recommend it to anyone whos up for a laughgood it is consistently funny with cool and interesting heroes the music is great and keeps in touch with the tone the movie attempts to set all the cast do fantastic jobs acting wise and you seriously believe their character melissa mccarthys rants are hysterically funny as is her unbelievable mode the cinematography is great and works very well it is a well directed edited composed and acted movie the actual action scenes were very well choreographed to feel bad ass jason statham is a personal favourite character and his insane egotistical attitude contrasts to melissas premode miranda hart and jude law do good with there performances though jude feels like more of a plot device peter serafinowicz did a good job of acting within acting his minitwist at the end was surprising and also funnybad the villains were not that interesting or unique or even special they just shifted the story along jude law was just a plot device over an actual character the twist at the end felt forced and just wasnt that interesting the slow motion action parts were just annoying and took away from the pace a much more fast paced action with little breaks would fit betterbest part any melissa mccarty rantmvp jason statham as ford810,comedy
i loved this film i didnt have high hopes when i chose it on netflix but laughed more than i have done for ages its not citizen kane ok but it has more laughs it is sweary and a bit crude but it all works statham is superb sending himself up and i even liked jude law miranda hart does her usual thing but again it works my partner told me to say how nice it was to see an older none thin women in a leading role,comedy
and with just 18 minutes i have come to appreciate the shitness romcoms are to miss lame penis jokes and started to think if my 410 rating for the movie the interview 2014 was bit overreacted because that would mean the difference from it to this was only 3 digits from the possible 9 maybe it was the feeling that this was made for generic tumblr users or the nature that fatso and her horselooking friend were somehow the kings get trickered of earth while being the worstwritten comedic devices since the word objectification which is spectacularly noteworthy and funny since this is supposed to be a story about strong independent women but lets not notice that due target intelligence i take this movie as a personal insult and i do not plan on forgiving,comedy
this is probably not the worst film ever made but its not far offlets start with the prosthe acting is ok  it has the polish of a hollywood filmnow for the consthe scriptits seriously unfunny kind of thing if you are nine or under then you might like anyone who is in double figures should definitely give this a miss a big missif you are a fan of miranda heart then this film may make you smile me i find her offensively unfunny her involvement alone makes this film arguably one of the worst everthe one point that really mad me raise an eyebrow was when the over the top cockney jason stathem uses the term twot the writers and continuity on this film are that lazy they couldnt even pick up that englishman say twat not twotvery much one of the worst pieces of cinema i have seen in years and years,comedy
2015 is an overmarketed overrated flop what were anyone thinking when they made this film is beyond me its not funny it doesnt stay true to its genres by any means its like they tried to copy the old films with a play mix on police academy did they really think that the whole world had completely got sucked into hey this is hot first off the lineup wow this film may have made jason statham lose the last bit of acting credibility just by being in it now i must say melissa mccarthy has been in a few sort of funny films but what happen here what is the big hype with 2015 its almost as bad as the 2014 annie movie remakei do feel quite mentally shot down after watching this as i was hoping to see a comedy which never got me to reached the point of a smile was there an actual point or story did everyone who watched this miss somethingsad to say but 2015 is for sure a wasted effort to recommend to anyone if there were anything good about this film maybe it got left out when it was being edited,comedy
my summary i think nails what is a few funny bits eg laws character accidentally shooting the guy in the head some banter between mccarthy and byrne surrounded by a juvenile predictable unintelligent unbelievable and overall really bad movie did i mention unbelievable no i didnt but i will now obese people simply arent athletic at all which is why theyre obese in the first place much less super agent tactical operator athletic so this whole movie comes across as contrived and unbelievable now if were actually a good comedy i could write off the unlikelihood of a fat super agent as its just a comedy but it isnt and i therefore didnt i normally dont waste time watching movies below 70 but was lured in by the high ratings of my wife and i watched it and i completely lost interest right around the time 50cent appeared at this point i very clearly remember laughing at loud and asking my wife how in the hell is this thing a 75 out of 10 on imdb is a 5 out of 10 at its very best but overall just awful and deserving of a single star,comedy
is indeed the worst movie of 2015it is extremely boringthis movie relies on vulgar words and swearing in a desperate attempt to make us laugh but in reality is a complete failuremaking fun of fat people and a movie which supports racismbad acting and not funny at allsave your money and save your time from this major disappointmentmelissa mccarthy made a fatal mistake by accepting to act in this rubbish moviei wonder  will melissa mccarthy act in adult movies for the sake of moneyavoid this movie at all costs,comedy
screw this movie in its fat ugly facei dont know what kind of crap youre trying to pull melissa but youre not funny the im so fat and ugly watch me fall over and swear act is getting old nothing you do in this movie is funny or interestingis a movie that lacks direction and tone half of the time it was sad and dramatic and other times it was funny it was neither and ultimately failed at both the 50 cent cameo was obviously phoned in his role was neither funny or complimentary to the plot jason stathams role was similar i found his general dickheadedness more annoying than funny the fact that he showed up in every scene against all logic was even worse rose byrne was predictable which is a shame because i do believe shes a very talented actress in the right roles damages 28 weeks later the villain is in the movie for about 10 minutes total  know nothing about this mastermind that we dont even hear that much about jude law who dies in the first 10 minutes of the film is a douche his death is supposed to be emotional are you seeing the problem how are we supposed to be sad about a character we barely know the film sets this scene up from nothingalso this movie is needless profane i nearly walked out i really didnt spend 18 just to see some guys erect cock on a camera i dont get it is it funny is it shocking either way the movie couldve done without it mccarthy constantly switches between sweetshy to mindnumbingly profane swears come out of her mouth like free gifts from oprahthe only saving grace in this movie is mccarthys sidekick whose name i forgot because she was severely underused she was far funnier than mccarthy this movie shouldve been her in the lead with somebody like stephen merchant somewhere in the mixanyway this movie blows hard do yourself a favor and watch mad max this weekend a movie with originality and visual flair and narrative heft,comedy
the family guy of movies is here a sneeze joke a bat poop joke awkward unrequited love jokes a pinkeye joke and fart jokes all within the first 35 minutes also like all of paul feigs films you have melissa mccarthy being humiliated for over 2 hours whats new about this one we get to see jude law play an infallible character while jason statham completely debases himself in his most embarrassing role todate then theres peter serafinowicz as aldo a sexual deviant who spends every moment he has onscreen trying to molest mccarthywhat about the action theres isnt any shaky camera effects but its filled with quick cuts and terrible special effects even worse feig randomly uses slowmotion during action stunts which becomes annoyingly repetitive and is completely pointless unlike the the wachowskis zack snyder and matthew vaughn who have mastered this effect making it a part of their style paul feig makes it clear he has no idea what hes doing truly a terrible writer and director with bad taste and no style of his owncan paul feig degrade women onscreen any further as bottom of the barrel as the jokes are throughout this atrocity the only thing that isnt made fun of is mccarthys weight yet every other aspect about her appearance and personality is targeted for cheap laughsso what can we learn from you can humiliate a woman in every way possible even sexual assault as long as you dont mention her weight also were all going to need to come together and boycott the new ghostbusters because paul feig should never be allowed to make another film again ever,comedy
if you up for a nonstop swearing pointless  tasteless socalled comedy flavoured with some stupid  inappropriate jokes then you will enjoy this 007parody aka comedy action otherwise do not waste your time watching it it is in my humble opinion jason stathams worth movie role  it would not add any respect for him i rated 110 was shocked to see such a high rating i guess the cultural standards  the tolerance in our society are responsible for that once again there are plenty of good movies do yourself a favour  skip this one safely you will not loose anything ps spoiler excessively high swearing content,comedy
this is the worst piece of shite i have ever seen the movie contains nothing the story is as hollow as the characters playing it its not even funny just some lame insults on each others all the time its not even kids humor since they show a lot of dicks in it how can great actors like melissa mccarthy and jason statham go as low as to take part in a movie like this can someone explain to me how this movie ended up with over 7 in score have you all lost your mind have they hired thousands of people to vote this movie up so they can earn more from it please people listen to me and save your time and money do not watch this movie its dreadful,comedy
watched half and gave up not sure who the target audience was seems like the plot and the scriptlines were put together quickly why film makers seem to think that if they get some actors that get really well paid this will be enough to carry a film i just dont know its not easy to make a good comedyi think and its lazy to make a crap one like this its just another dickvagina movie that maybe they hoped teens going through puberty might like life is too short to watch junk films please spend more on paying people to write well and funny lines melissa mc is just another adam sandler type of character who needs to be retired after 10 minutes,comedy
you look at the reviews and they all give only 1 star what the heck in a movie that clearly never takes itself seriously why are people taking it so seriously i honestly loved this movie and no im not a teenager its a satire with great action scenes and a good rhythm there were so many memorable moments in this movie for me like susan cooper killing the guy unintentionally ford showing up in coopers hotel and bragging about all absurd things hes ever done every scene that ford appears the airplane scene and the coopers fight with the woman in the kitchen was totally badass,comedy
this is a story of a back up cia agent played by melissa mccarthy who volunteers to go on a mission in europe and track an gun dealer in possession of a big bomb yeah why notwellno though the actress is playing rather well nothing works on that movie from the neverending dull dialogs to the succession of flat action scenes this movie satire disrespects any viewer any european would be offended by so many clichs that are apparently useful for the sake of the storyline poorly written the year 2015 started pretty well and that is the first turkey of the year this movie is in the same vein as just married 2003 or meet the spartans you end up hating the director for wasting your time and 65 millions  of somebody elses money,comedy
the movie is awful the acting is terrible the jokes are cold and stupid i am wondering how people laugh with movies like that i still crying for the time i lose for watching this amazing piece of crapone of ten star is to much for this movie i look for paul feigs another movies and i found that he has no one good in his carrier this is random  i do not think sofor me the right rating for this film is 020dont watch it dont rent it dont buy itin few words avoid it you will save your time,comedy
the teaser is better than the movie i fell into this trap because the rating this movie has here and some other sites is totally misleading thats why i am writing this dont go to this is just gross nothing is funny and a total waste of resources like jude law and statham i did not mention mccarthy because i didnt know this woman but i will never watch another one with her as main roleit starts really well but from the first scene when we were introduced to a full erected penis out of nowhere the things started to melt i am not an english speaker but the level of dialogue this film has is the lowest ive never seen i have to say that i like raw comedies but it seems the train went out of tracks since national lampoons animal house arrived back then you had bluto but not only you have a bunch of very good acting and characters that mixed perfectly in the end mccarthy is not john belushi and paul feig is not john landis,comedy
i will be the first to say im a huge fan of melissa mccarthy however this movie was a stinker my entire family sat down to enjoy what we thought would be a really entertaining flick but only made it to about 30 minutes in before we shut the tv off this movie had the potential of being so much more but it was dumbed down with tasteless jokes and vulgarity folks if youre thinking about renting this movie dont waste your money and melissa pleasei beg youdo not agree to do another film of this ilk youre better than this im not sure what happened to you since bridesmaids but im beginning to lose faith youve got another opportunity to show off your comic chops in ghostbusters please dont disappoint,comedy
boring trash  with porno  think they cant find a good plot for this one so they added porn a new low for jason  keep away from kids might scare themand an shocking profanities starts to wheeze a bit as it reaches the finish line this is not a story that needs two hours to be told also i could have done without the mice and the bats and the projectile vomiting gross isnt always funny what does work in every scene is melissa mccarthys performance shes as funny and as winning as anyone in the movies these daysincluding some graphic deaths by gunfire knives and big fallsthis movie became rather tiresome with its off color humor and vulgarity lost interest and bit appalled didnt finish watching it american films have become stupider and stupider,comedy
i found the entire premise of this movie to be that being fat is funny which isnt really funny to me the movie focuses on two women who are literally put in a basement the main actress is very overweight she goes about doing a poor imitation of comedy in the movie the same movie performed by an average weight actress essentially would have no basis for a movie at all it would be a competently skilled woman who is treated poorly by her bosses and goes and does a mission attempt i found the movie actually offensive since nearly every scene uses one of the two actress weight or ugliness as a back theme for a joke call me lame but an entire movie of fat jokes was just boring,comedy
oh dear i had the misfortune to see this mess of a movie recently such a shamewith a cast of great brits including the gorgeous miranda hart  of course the equally gorgeous jason statham the plot was so predictablebeen done so many times beforeneed i explain the mismatching of personalities between miranda  mellisa was so puerilemaybe mellisa does not have enough to carry a major movieespecially with british actorswith the personality of miranda hartwho could easily have carried the movie alone jason statham popped up for a momentfind her a project like paul bartmall cop or anything that roseanne barr turned downor rosie odonnell im sure she will not be offendedas thats how she sells herselfas a fatfunnysometimeswoman as a larger size ladyyou dont need to rely on your size to get laughsyou are a gorgeous looking woman mellisayou can do so much betterwearing a wig does not make you funny no doubtthis movie will go straight to dvdin the bargain bin,comedy
full erect penis was unnecessary that ruined the whole movie and its where i stopped watching you might as well watch a porn movie with your family friends and wife absolutely disgusting they could have censored it but i guess this generation loves it there is way too much profanity as well it switches between comedy and stupid for some weird odd reason mccarthys movies all seem the same i decided this will be the last movie i ever watch with her totally predictable as well i only wanted to watch it because of the rating on here but its definitely is not worth that rating i give it a 1 out of 10 please do yourself a favor and save your time by not watching this movie all the people involved in this movie should be ashamed of themselves this movie is nothing but proof that our world is degrading,comedy
i have to admit that i had a couple of beers when i saw this movie but even that didnt take the edge off the awfulness of it and my feeling that it was an unscripted  make it up as you go along  nice holiday for the actors kind of movie why was the f word used so often  i can swear with the best of them but not in general conversation and without any sense or meaning i will state publicly at risk of being assassinated that imho jason statham cant act and ive cringed so many times when ive tried to watch his movies that i couldnt mention why was amanda hart in this what shes not an actress and fails miserably at comedy  i saw her in not going out britcom and she was just the stooge,comedy
pros every actor in the movie was capable and delivered a good performance the action scenes where really welldone and violent jason statham can do comedy jude law delivered a good performance rose byrne gave the best performance of her career so far shes also super sexy in the movie the first 510 minutes of the movie were entertaining and good my favorite scene was when jude law sneezed and accidentally shot a man in the head because of it cons the movie was 100 predictable and clichd there were a lot of stupid unnecessary moments what was the point with the bats and the mice gag melissa mccarthy became the same old melissa mccarthy during the last half of the movie after the first 510 minutes of the movie i felt like the whole thing hit generic beats and it was tiresome the movie was not very funny i feel asleep during the last 45 minutes or so i usually only fall asleep if i believe a movie to be boring to me was a really dull plain and boring pile of crapconclusion is a horrible movie i have no idea why some people are accepting this atrocious and unacceptable atrocity as entertaining some things where good about the movie every actor who was in the movie delivered finegood performances but none of the actors could save this predictable and clichd mess from itself melissa mccarthy has to stop making these horrible movies she delivered the same tired old stick like it was business as usual i really want to see her perform in some serious movie at some point in time im giving up on melissa mccarthy she was great in bridesmaids but every other movie ive seen her in since than has been simple stupid and delivering the same old tired routinei swear some audiences are extremely gulliblefinale grade f if there is such a thing note the plus is only for the performances,comedy
poor melissa mccarthy no self esteem no selfrespect and obviously no shame she is a person that no doubt has talent and intelligence but nobody has told her so which can be the only reason she would embarrass herself with this demeaning tacky and unfunny garbage over in over repeating the previous bad movie she completed beforethis train wreck of a film wasted hours of my life and took down so many actors with its insipidly juvenile plot terrible script and inane dialogue i even found myself wishing my movie hero jason statham all the terrible deaths he so gloriously dished out in all his previous movies he is the guy that guy richie made be great and funny but the feig that directed this crap made me want to never see him in another movie againand i am the guy who even liked him in in the name of the king please jason take that fast car you are known for and drive the heck away from this toxic drivel and drag jude law behind you for venturing into this bad choice jude law is such a great actor please send him to rehab if he is this desperate to finance his habits and tell him not to share needles with rose byrnesuch a beautiful lady to waste in this movie obviously written by some potty mouthed sixth graders or seth mcfarlanethat melissa mccarthy is wasting her lives on fart joke vomit jokes peepee picture jokes and degrading herself by just being the fatchick butt of all jokes at the expense of her dignity is just a tragedy id rather not see her degrade herself to the point that i will in the future seek out more intellectual movies like something with jim carrie or yahoo seriousthe plot has been done better and before a thousand times the dialogueunbelievably childish and unoriginal the movie comes together like an episode of the cleveland show which itself is just an unoriginal rehashing of family guy which itself is just a rehashing of the lesser episodes of the simpsons with all of the humor fun joy originality spirit and souls removedomg it was the longest two hours of my life avoid like the plague and dont encourage these movies to reproducethis is how people like jack black can have a career the only good thing about this movie is that jack black wasnt in it too,comedy
i was looking forward to this spoof movie thinking it was going to take the mickey out of the genre with the rating i expected the occasional expletive boy was i wrong it had all the potential and indeed had its moments however i think the dialogue of every lead role was 50 f words im thinking how long did it take to throw that script together after all the expletives were noted half the script was complete jason stathams character in particular cursed no endadd to this the graphic inyourface scene where someones penis is graphically put on display in any number of angles for about 30 seconds  nudity that has simply nothing to do with the storyline and you wonder if this movie is not about satiating the directors exhibitionism my wife was highly offended and i cringe to think how many teen girls wouldve seen the scene hardcore porn has a new outleteventually my wife and i could no longer stand the relentless onslaught of unjustified expletives and stopped watching something i very seldom dowhat a waste of talent a low point in jason statham and other main actors careers in my opinion disgusted,comedy
melissa mccarthy stars in roseanne blart cop playing a deskbound cia analyst who volunteers to go undercover and find a deadly arms dealer okay im sorry lets try and be professional is the first melissa mccarthy film ive seen and without doubt it will definitely be the last its written and directed by paul feig the man who thinks he understands the ghostbusters franchise so well he wants to reboot it with a female cast because thats the cool thing to do these days right is there an agenda in hollywood that is pushing feig and mccarthy did i miss a meeting or a memo anyway despite an impressive cast featuring rose byrne jude law jason statham and peter serafinowicz the film is the most mediocre garbage ive seen this year thumbs up to byrne and statham playing characters out of their comfort zone but the tired forced stupidity was overbearing throw in an eye rolling clich cameo from rapper 50 cent and youre all set for a complete waste of time i feel dirty just thinking i spent two hours watching this why is it two hours long its comedy consists of jaw dropping bottom of the barrel material such as fart jokes dick pics racial stereotypes racist abuse fat woman shouting and fat woman falling over i wasnt fooled by the razor sharp wit that is actually random dumb irrelevant humour which will appeal to the lowest common denominator its the goto structure for lazy mainstream comedies todaydo you remember intelligent well written agent comedies such as pink panther naked gun or more recently red and the kingsman well you wont find anything remotely similar here its shocking is being praised as progressive and full of belly laughs more like formulaic and full of st despite her tag as the female kevin james i gave mccarthy a chance despite the trailer looking average i gave the film a chance boy should i have gone with my instincts,comedy
22 november 2015i saw this lousy movie because i thought it was going to be funny this movie has more cursing in it than a x rated porno movie pretty latin actress morena baccarin is the only reason worth watching this movie and cute rose byrne is good but she has the mouth of a foul mouth truck driver in this filmafter seeing melissa mccarthy in her tv show mike  molly and in her break out movie identity thief which i liked and it did not have a lot of hard core profanity in it i thought i would like her in this movie wow i wrong the movie is not funny and the every minute cursing makes it even worse although melissa is an overweight actress she is nice looking but i will not see another melissa movie nor will i see more movies like train wreck due to too much unnecessary cursing in every scene jason statham whom i like in his action movies is a walking trash can and a waste in this moviewhy is it that movie studios and production companies think to make a movie funny it must have a lot of profanity in it studios and production companies need to wake the hell up and take a look at the success of big guy comic actor kevin james movies like hitch paul blartmall cop 12 and here comes the boom all very funny movies with little to no profanity at all i liked all of kevins movie i had to complain to the theater manager and he gave me a free ticket to see another movie which was much better,comedy
seriously how on earth did this film get an overall good high rating on imdb because i have a feeling the people that rated it high had their heads up their ass while the trailers made it look like a fair film but by the time i got to watch it i couldnt believe how shockingly awful this film is the comedy or the lack of comedy was completely unfunny the acting was poor and cheesy has an unnecessary showing of an actual dick in it lots of boring yakking shouting childish insults and jason statham acting like an immature child gosh was this film even made by real people or was it made by teletubbies i just cant believe jude law and jason statham would stoop so low to being in this filthy pig stein of a movie just for a quick cheque somewhere at the beginning of this film i was actually considering turning this film off sure the film did get better but it was still like a pair of dirty underwear pants that just wouldnt wash never again im i going to watch another film starring melissa mccarthy not even in the upcoming ghostbusters movieoverall of all the films ive seen come out in 2015 this is by far the worst movie of 2015 avoid this film everyone for your own sakes,comedy
this bizarrely badly written and badly acted movie has suspiciously gotten a lot of buzz it is not anything but a formulaic movie designed to sell us products and the lie that this movie has anything new to offer fans of the genre nothing in this movie makes it worth the time or money spent seeing it even if that was the matine i will never see another melissa mccarthy move if this professional was satisfied with this terrible script and production then perhaps she should consider another field her fifteen minutes of fame have lapsed as far as i am concerned i would not trust anyone who gives this film more stars than one and would believe they were paid for their reviews before i would believe anyone who loves film would rate this film higher than that,comedy
this is starting to become a habit for me and i truly apologize but this is the second review i have for a movietv show where i didnt even finish it i had to downgrade it all the way to a 1 because i have zero desire to finish it and i dont think i laughed once during the half that i made it throughi see a lot of people complaining about the profanity and i somewhat see their point personally i am not offended by foul language as i curse like a sailor on a regular basis but  swear words shouldnt be the foundation of the comedy actually calling this movie a comedy is a complete misnomer i understand why its in the comedy section but the only thing funny about this movie is that someone thought it would be funnyi liked the heat couldnt stand bridesmaids i have concluded that i am not his target demographic but i thought this one might be entertaining nope and it solidified my fears that ghostbusters is going to be a disaster ill never watch a paul feig movie again and im done with mccarthy overweight chicks who complain about bad things happening to them should be ignored the mere idea of her chasing anyone at any point in time is just preposterous and there was a staircase involved give me a break she looks like she gets winded just standing up from the seated positionthe first five minutes is almost entertaining i almost laughed at the sneeze and then i didnt smile again until i pressed stop none of the reviews ive read suggest that the movie ever recovers from the flat spin that it enters at the 10 minute mark so i have no desire to see how the second half of the movie turns out,comedy
it is clear that questions things inspired the creation of this movie how can we make a movie around our feminist misconceptions and how can we get as much product placement into this as possible i read other reviews about people not liking melissa mccarthy i frankly think she is very talented and hopefully this movie was just the dud of her career this movie was terrible it was not even entertaining basically the movie goes through some clich movie stuff of which this movie was meant to be a satire of but fell terribly flat the whole movie was filled from the viewpoint of feminist misconceptions i am down for good political satire but this was so out there that it did not work one of th worst movie i have seen in years and it did not make me go out and buy the plethora of products that they placed through the whole movie movies like this make me wonder about the future of the film industry being viable,comedy
i love jason statham and we like jude law i even enjoy melissa mccarthy in her tv show but why cant she do a decent movie what a complete waste of timei was hoping for fun family comedy that showed a strong female character kicking butt and being funnywhat i got was two hours of adolescent male humor complete with a slew of fart jokes a never ending string of foul language and disturbing put downs and di pics at least a full three minutes of up close and personal pics and videos of a male di from head to shaftthe comedy was few and far between unless dumb and dumber to is your type of moviethis was uncomfortable to watch even with my 17 and 22 year oldoverall the characters were ok except jason statham who seemed to struggle with a comedic role and the story line had a lot of potential but in the end the ridiculous bathroom humor won and two of my movie companions left the room half way through and the other one picked up his computer to watch youtube videosand while the ending was cute it wasnt redeeming enough for me to be glad i had stayed i dont understand the disgusting need to make every movie about shtting and vomit di pics and character contests of who can string together the foulest insults and the most profanity i want to watch fun movies with my kids and my friends and it seems like thats not possible unless its made for toddlers there doesnt seem to be any in between for the movie industry i can either watch disney movies or seth rogan and melissa mccarthy getting high and putting their dis on the table to measure and examinedont waste your money unless you really like mellissa mccarthy movies and a dumbed down version of anything seth rogan and james franco have done together definitely dont watch with your family or friends who arent interested in three minutes of pornand if you do watch remember you were warned i will not watch another melissa mccarthy movie ever again,comedy
i watched only because it had a 93 rating on rotten tomatoes also peter travers called it irresistible and peter travers doesnt do that unless a movie is truly irresistible after watching which included skipping through half of it except for jason stathams portions i kept wondering if he was talking about the same movie so what were you on mr traversmelissa mccarthy is arguably the best comedian at work right now the heat was just incredible but with she had nothing to work with apart from a bunch of contrived jokes and situations that probably escaped from dane cooks standup material and took refuge in paul feigs mind god knows the entire cast did their best to salvage some form of comedy from a juvenile script that felt like it was written by a 11year old brat with a laptop half a brain and no sense of humor you know a films trying too hard when it pulls out the puke on dead body card oh yeah spoiler alertfeigs probably a good director but going by what i saw hes also probably a stinky writer what a waste of a killer cast statham was good but maybe thats because weve never seen him like this his performance merits a comedy movie of his own hopefully not written by feig so mr travers wtf did you watch what were you on did you trip into a chamber full of laughing gas while watching the movie yeah i know what im saying is subjective maybe i just didnt get the humor for which im actually thankful but still what were you on sir whatever it is i hope youre on it when youre watching my movie if i end up making one and how on earth did you not like horrible bosses did you run out of your pile or something im worried about you to the reader if you havent seen id suggest you dont but 93 240 million dollars and one of the worlds most respected movie critics say that you just might itll probably help if you sneeze into a giant pile of cocaine before you pop the dvd,comedy
a shockingly overrated comedy that at times makes you forget what its purpose is let me start by emphasizing that melissa mccarthy is a great actress but her talents are unfortunately dwarfed in this film by the poorly written script and bad acting of others has a good start but it quickly and consistently deteriorates toward the end with cheap jokes extremely repetitive and ineffective profanity and subpar special effects it definitely had funny almost hilarious moments in it but there were very few of those i can understand that one of the goals was to create a refreshingly modern comedy by injecting current cultural trends and standards but it completely loses its grip on the comedy part the consistent cursing ruins the dialogs and gets very annoying and i usually dont have a problem with fowl language in films even with apparent hints of feminism the movie seems to consistently humiliate its main female characters in the name of comedy the plot is weak to say the least but then again its a comedy and that was expected having seen other works of paul feig like bridesmaids and the heat i was very disappointed with this one,comedy
if youre totally into a comedy script with repetitive fbomb this movie is for you i dont normally pay to see comedies but we have a fairly new dinein theater and wanted to have a nice first experience by watching a funny and witty movie the trailer was good so we were excited for a great time with light fun and laughter ah not admittedly there were some very funny scenes and the acting was good but the constant barrage of swearing spoiled it for me no doubt this movie reflects the type of humor many viewers probably want to see today sexual innuendo fbomb in nearly every line and unfortunately really bad fat jokes id like to think im wrong about this but i was shocked to read so many positive reviews dont worry to those i may be offending please continue to enjoy your servings of lowdown dirt warning do not bring children do not recommend,comedy
the film starts fairly well it has an almost 007 polish on the intro scenes and opening credits unfortunately it goes downhill fast from there even if you didnt know going in it is a comedy the problem is that it quickly becomes humorless to anyone more than a few years past puberty i would almost say intellectually it was true lies for disney xd and therein lies my confusion with the fbombs in triple digits and other profanity as prolific you push the film to an r rating who was their target audience the freshmen class at retarded uby cleaning up the script and cutting or at least sanitizing just a few scenes this could have easily been a pg13 film drawing parents as well as their kids not only that it likely would have been much funnieri hope the writers and producers as well as the director of this film starve their poor choices certainly should not be rewarded its sad that a film that has been ruined by crassness solely for crassness sake should have a 7210 rating at the time of this writing,comedy
the first 15 minutes of seen it before jokes that werent funny the first time was all i needed to abandon this movie if youre a fan of melissa mccarthy you might like it but youve seen it all before the jokes were cheesy and unfunny leaving me with no desire to continue watching the rest of the movie the constant outpouring of nonsense babbling from mccarthy is annoying and it is readily apparent that the viewer will have to put up with it for the entirety of the film it tries to be leslie nielsenesque but even fails on that front within the first 15 minutes you can tell that youve seen it all before and its not likely to get any better as the film progresses,comedy
melissa mccarthy as well as jason statham spoke their lines as if reading from a script which they were obviously it was too unnatural and stiff movie was like something mass produced form the hollywood grinder comedy forced down your throat very low brow humor last scene was the best cause the movie was over cant go by ratings on rotten tomatoes 50 percent at best i would keep tearing this movie up but its not worth the time i am just writing now because imdb reviews requires a minimum of 10 lines to post a review i you really want to see cheap shot bad comedy go ahead and watch damn i thought that was 10 lines already ok that has to be ten by now this review is drawing out like the movie just keeps kicking you in the nuts with cheap humor not even humor just force fed garbage that follywood wants you to think as funny i dont know why they have to stoop to a really low level like that the lines are like instant gratification humor i guess they give the people what they think they want,comedy
i watch this at least once a week it just gets better and funnier as it goes along following melissss character and her side kick this movie wouldnt have worked without miranda great yin and yang theyshould remake abfab melissa as edina ans miranda as a super tall patsy abfab on speed i cant wait for the sequel this was a brilliant movie for adults apparently some people are squeamish im lucky im not a little bitch who leaves 10 bad reviews from different emails because my 12th cat died i dont understand these bad reviews unless its just haters with a bible up their butts theyll probably vote for trump lol ewwwwwwww can you say pass i dont trust reviews usually so im here to say this movie actually made me laugh nothing makes me laugh anymore five stars,comedy
is an action comedy starring the versatile and hilarious actress melissa mccarthy this movie is an american version of a james bond movie with added humorbut not in the manner of movies like johnny english 2003 or mordecai 2015 its not a parody the movie has a rather serious and complex plot complete with red herrings and twists i wouldnt say its completely realistic but its just enough to make it very funny without being too outlandish it reminds me of one of my all time favorite action comedies true lies 1994 where in both films unlikely people are thrust into cia missions susan cooper mccartney is a cia agent who works as a guide for bradley fine jude law while fine is doing field work he is equipped with cameras cooper watches these cameras and alerts fine of oncoming danger during a mission to stop the transferring of a nuclear bomb the cameras begin to malfunction coopers images become unclear and fine is shot the cia chooses to put cooper on the field to continue fines mission cooper has been at her desk her entire career however cooper is considered a cia agent and therefore is considered qualified to take on the mission although she is seemingly far from fit for the job in many ways being that cooper has always worked at a desk she is completely unknown to the enemies and can thus work well undercover having worked with fine all these years and having deeper feelings for fine than even he knew cooper feels it is her duty to avenge fines death she sets off to europe jumping from one crazy circumstance to another she quickly become more than meets the eye as her quick wit and even physical abilities are unleashed this is a great comedy filled with witty banter british satire slapstick comedy and even some raunchy humor stay for the creditseven theyre funny,comedy
this film contains a lot of nonworking jokes and im referring to members of the cinema audience who were laughing at most jokes that they didnt actually laugh at a lot of stuff that were obviously meant as jokes but fell flathaving said that there are a few laugh out loud moments in this film for me especially where i really didnt want to laugh but couldnt help myself i also liked a lot of the moments where i felt the laughs were for women not at women have we reached a higher consciousness where feministic comedy is concerned id like to think sothe fort of mccarthy is what makes this film work along with parts of the script the plot is ridiculous as is most of the twists but some of the jokes are really funny even though most of the physical comedy sadly makes me remember benny hill and yearn for monty python or south park this film doesnt exactly win at being a pastiche of the james bond franchise but its better than being a parodythis film reminds me of a semifailed standup performance where you laugh because of some of the jokes but not at most you wait for the good ones to come but its a bad rollercoaster ride,comedy
after reading all those bad reviews  i decided to write my own review the movie was excellent it was really fun to watch it made me laugh it was the best comedy i have ever watched the movie had a plotit moved on fast melissa mc carthy was acting as she should nothing like her awful acting in the heat jason statham was really good at his role as a disastrous i also liked the fact that the movie switched places fast traveling through the beauty of european cities it was very enjoyable the reason i give 910 and not 1010  were 2 gruesome killings which could have been avoided i mean they could have died without so much splatter that would make the movie suitable for younger audience but in general  the movie has an interesting plot a great cast a beautiful cinematography i totally recommend it,comedy
theres the offcolor saying that you cant polish a turd but this slick sick gives it a try a lot of elbow grease went into the attempt this vulgar lowbrow juvenile junk looks great employs many cgi super tricks and delivers the thing in rapidfire modebut no amount of packaging superstars and yes money can elevate this embarrassing mess from the gutter where it was spawned it may hold the record for the number of cringe inducements in a major motion picturesome creators like seth macfarlane have enough media savvy and popculture chops along with a razor sharp wit and he can get away with potty humor and locker room stuff because theres some there thereno there here and it is the lack of wit that makes this one fail scene after scene it is a nonstop onslaught of fwords and insults some critics and viewers seem to get a kick out of it so it isnt a total waste if fat stars making endless fun of their obesity and slinging nonstinging insults around and ugly females constantly showing selfreferential humor about their lack of sexual activity is your cup of repulsiveness go for it theres more of this stuff on the way,comedy
i found bridesmaids lovely within limits it set up for itself of course it had chemistry between actors and believable plight so we had an entry into someones home before we started slipping lewdly on the floor it was anchored into somethingthis is by the same filmmaker but he built this time using the most tired formula imaginable the cartoon where we swap bonds suaveness for goofy incompetence it seems like they make one of these every year mccarthy has to be the unlikely on a mission and in her own bumbling way of course makes it the joke is that she has to look like a cat lady from iowathe moral is this is just the disguise foisted on her by society as part of a narrative of how were taught to perceive ourselves and she must learn to assert herself but the jokes are only stuck in corny movie clich and along the way we get guns fights and chases played straight all of it needless boredom because youre not going to wow us with action in a mccarthy comedynothing stands see if you want to make a cartoon where nothing is anchored you have to continuously assail our expectations and so fast that we dont have time to notice theres no ground beneath our feet  naked gun they try to bother with a plot herei dont think mccarthy can be the center of a movie because shes so good with antics and it looks like it comes so easy i imagine a lot of ad libbing from her the desire to turn her into will ferrell overpowers anything else i cant say whether thats down to narrow imagination on the part of producers or how she perceives herself within her craft but there are different ways to slip,comedy
i enjoyed this for some stressrelief yes it is very vulgar quite often but i adore miranda hart jude law is some suave damn eyecandy melissa is funny as always and it was nice seeing her take on an action role stratham must have needed something as light relief from his usual british crime seriousness he does idiot well it turns out and rose byrne was an adorable lethal spoilt brat just some fun maybe i could have done without male porn bits that thing i dont know if it was real but it was repulsive eww,comedy
any fan of melissa mccarthy must see this film if you thought she was funny in bridesmaids she really gets to spread her wings in this film foulmouthed funny check physical comedy check fatgirl jokes check and double check action star say what yes melissa mccarthy is everything shes been in prior films and is now an action star watch her take out six or seven baddies with her bare hands watch her fight a manic female killing machine in a jackie chan or bruce lee inspired kitchen fight scenethis is a perfect sendup of a james bond film including the music the settings the casinos the costumes the cars the weapons the chases the villains the double crosses etc etc etc kudos to the writers and the directors for making this film look and feel exactly like a bond film but with nonstop funny if youve seen rowan atkinson do this in the johnny english spoofs you now need to see melissa mccarthy do it even better,comedy
if someone told you melissa mccarthy is playing a in a movie whatever comes to your head thats all there is in the movie zero surprises all the jokes predictable fat lady fighting funny fat lady riding a bike very funny fat lady dressing up fancy cant stop laughing now fat lady has a bestie who is somehow weirder thats newi was hoping she would branch out after watching her in st vincent but no such luck she sticks to what shes done in almost all her movies,comedy
fun feminist comedy perfectly enjoyable a ribtickling espionage spoof critics and audiences of america you have been duped is not very good its barely even passable both as a broad comedy and as a spoof im sorry but this stuff is the lowest of low hanging fruit and even the most seemingly learned among you are poised to be hosed here its not completely your fault though critics i get it melissa mccarthy is a talented star the mere fact that a woman of her lets say unique perspective can become a popular cultural figure is a sure sign of progress in a certain sense additionally having a woman as a lead in a genre dominated by heteronormative male tropes is beguiling but in the case of its not only a missed opportunity its a ruse and not a clever one eitherlet us start at the beginning mccarthy plays a talented cia analyst who is often paired up and runs interference for a suave sophisticated field agent law however after the agents untimely death the cia quickly realizes that all their best agents are compromised the only way they can recover a stolen nuclear weapon from a nefarious arms dealer is to put mccarthys susan into the field to gather intelligence and possibly save the worldwhat could have been a truly ballsy subversive routine ends up being a broad heckle from the sidelines the first half of the movie consists of mccarthys character being the butt of every mean spirited gag in the book shes fat she dresses poorly shes homely etc the thing is its not clever or thought out its basically glorified improv the directors excuse to let his players riff so he can cut everything together later all of it sounds like the taunting of a dimwitted high school bully seriously who acts this way without fully realizing their total dicks and impressing nobody the only actor who is partially successful in balancing mean and funny is jason statham who by the last halfhour is transformed into a falstaffian caricature lacking any real substancein fact all of the characters including susan do somersaults to fit the plot compromising character motivations traits and interests susan snaps from a scared introverted analyst to a foul mouthed asskicker with the sudden sound of a cocked handgun another character murders and witnesses the murder of multiple people yet is reluctant to pull the trigger on a shoehorned comic relief character hart because ofreasons jason stathams character quits the cia then does his own investigation to stop the people who murdered a colleague he hated because ofreasons bobby cannavales character wants to blow up the un because ofreasons you see a pattern emerging here no matter lets all watch a gregarious italian man grope melissa mccarthy againthe second act of the film consists of an escalating number of action setpieces which offer nothing new to the genre action comedy or otherwise its all so paintbynumbers that rarely anything is given suspense even the jokes that pepper the chase sequences and closequarters fighting are so painfully obvious its hard not to let the mind wonder and miss the days of austin powers by the third act all the dead horses are flogged and dead dogs boiled all thats left to do is tag on convoluted doublecrosses and swap allegiances a few times in the vein hope that the audience still cares about our all but ignored maguffinmy main problem with is it completely fails to lampoon or undermine the point of films instead replicating the same tired comedy schtick thats been around since casino royale 1967 theyre male fantasies that not only glamorize violence they glamorize living life in a haze of grey james bond ethan hunt jason bourne et al they embrace the peril of a lifestyle that shifts with the alliances of criminals terrorists governmental bodies and femme fatales thats a smith and wesson and youve had your six smirks bond in dr no 1962 before killing a helpless assassin they dispatch foes with the coolness of true professionals and we root for the characters despite their bloodlust seems so concerned with knocking on mccarthys girth and gender that it fails to really get to why something like mission impossible 1996 is a draw in the first place honestly in like flint 1967 is postactively a better takedown of sexism in action movies than there are worse movies than to be sure far from a nadir in the genre to be sure i can fill a days worth of column inches with terrible action comedy movies if broad lazy comedy is your particular brand of weak tea you may well get your moneys worth with yet with folks raving that this newest mccarthy vehicle is some kind of feminist provocation i simply had to clear the air and say its simply not like almost all american comedy over the last ten years is just another improv session among a stock cast of players all hoping their game of park bench ends up in the theatrical cut what could have been a shot across the bow to male dominated cinema ended up being the flick of a paper football tossed by a pigtailed girl asking politely if she can play if i were you id just take my ball and go home,comedy
this is the first movie that i have ever seen involving either paul feig or melissa mccarthy sadly i was unimpressedsince feig is credited with writing and directing this nonsense he must shoulder much of the blame the script makes no sense at all which might be less damaging in a slapstick piece of froth like this is supposed to be if the film was more entertainingthe dialogue is risible it sounds like something said by the barely literate twitter teenagers who must surely be the only people that could possibly be interested in watching thisthe direction is mediocre workmanlike and unimaginativethe casting leaves a lot to be desired apparently feig has worked with mccarthy a lot and her playing a lead in this just seems like lazy nepotismjude law is terrible as the cias top agent his us accent is weak and his embarrassment is topped  no pun intended by his terrible toupeesaving graces are jason statham spoofing his on screen persona brilliantly but his potential is totally wastedmiranda hart an actress i have never particularly liked is surprisingly good here and brings an energy the film doesnt deserve,comedy
this movie is an insult to the intelligence of a first grader full of gratuitous f bombs and supposedly comedy situations that werent funny and pointless penis selfie pictures i was embarrassed for poor melissa mccarthy who was forced to play the lowesteemed fat girl here she was insulted throughout the film with other characters demeaning her and she had to just take it i dont know who would give this movie a 75 but suspect it was the same people who made it dont waste your time on this one my friend and i left before the movie was over the popcorn was the only redeeming part of the experiencei want my money back,comedy
had high hopes for this movie but it really disappoints for some reason these spoof films seem to fail mortdecai starring johnny depp is one example nothing recent comes close to the austin powers films this one sees melissa mccarthy playing a cia agent who volunteers to get into the field the movie is quite predictable and all the funny parts feel forced and the better scenes are all seen in the trailer basically if youve watched the trailer then you watched the best parts of the film and you can just skip the rest all characters are very annoying and none are likable no real backbone history of any of themaction was lame and boringjason statham and rose byrne two of my favorite actors fail to impress here probably because of what they had to work with and the poorly written script i really got bored mid way through the film and wanted to leave the plot is slow and you just keep waiting for the funny parts that never arrive or do arrive but youve already seen them in the trailerid skip this one,comedy
my heavens i dont know how hollywood manages to pump out such dreck despite having an excellent cast and what would appears to be a technical crew at the top of their game we end up with this steaming pile of turd to some extent it couldnt have been helped because the script and i use that term loosely is terrible i wish i were exaggerating but that isnt the caseis supposed to be a comedy i like comedies but not the stuff that hollywood writes for easily amused morons this film surely fits into that category i chuckled briefly but three times in the space of two hours thats terrible plenty of idiots around me we laughing though so if youre a member of sweatpants nation or if you own a fanny packwaist pack then be sure to take in you might very well love it,comedy
the movie starts off a bit boorish but has a few laughable situations it is one of those movies that you know what will happen next before it does i usually enjoy melissa mccarthy but even she couldnt make this a watchable movie somewhere after the exposed penis shots and convex lens tricksi mean is this supposed to be soft porn i fell asleep from boredom but only wish i could have fell asleep sooner no i wish i had saved my money this happens to be the worst movie i have watched this year from its plot less script to its cheap throw in naked bodies shots i cannot see anyone rating it as a must see i was being nice to rate it a three its actually about a 25,comedy
this is insanely bizarre and puzzling to me ive seen some really shitty movies all the way through in my life i was the one guy left in the cinema when batman and robin ended years back well me and one other guy whom had fallen asleep apparently all the others left pretty early onpoint is i see all movies through when i first start on it no matter what but i couldnt bare this one more than halfway through after around 200 cringe worthy fat jokes in the first 15 minutes and one plump clich after another i had more than enough mind you im a normal build guy not taking offense because of any selfloathing to put it mildly but i do take offense in tedious repetitive jokes i love idiotic comedies like hangover and project x as much as any other i even thought bridesmaides was really funny during my 40 minutes with i think i smiled twice itll forever be one of the greatest mysteries in cinema history to me why this is rated higher than already mentioned batman and robin i am probably one of the few that thought a ghostbusters reboot had potential to become funny especially since i really like kristen wiig but not after this not at all paul feig is on his way to becoming the michael bay of comedy to me,comedy
the course language gradeschool banter and sexuallyovert situational slapstick was over done the director lost control on this movie it seems as though paul feig had his dialogue and conduct cues coming form speed dialling his production assistant who may or may not have been front and centre at a backalleybrawlers fight club whilst roaming around in the redlight districts of budapest there was very little done in consideration of mastering the english language and demonstrating some maturity this immature and petty movie no originality or imagination on how intelligent people would or should handle bruised egos sexual tension and anger without reaching for the toilet and licking it before their lines came due actioncomedies can be well done this one was not though there are several funny moments in they become regrettably forgettable because you want to wash your ears out with soap or wish you could not see that again actioncomedy in the ranks of most jackie chan projects and the movies true lies mib will be entertaining for decades  raunchy perverted spoofsatires will be bottom shelf as long as intelligent people are choosing to be entertained and stimulated by their experience and not wanting their sensibilities attacked im sure the box office statistics will reflect my opinion this movie will not have the staying power of other movies in this category heres hoping that his remake of ghostbusters will have better less egregious situational dialogueit was nice to see jason in some comic relief he can be very funny in a serious way his role as an unfocused blunderingactionagent slash mrbeanwithagun was a funny distraction but i dont really think jason statham needed to take this project on he really should have said no to mrfeig and moved onto any number of projects which other better directors were waiting for him to say yes to jason youre an alist actor made me think you were slipping onto the blistyou really can just say no melissa shame on you for being so desperate as to allow yourself to be exploited and humiliated for a pay cheque  its a long way back to wholesomeness and sensibility for a beautiful woman worthy of so much better than what this movie gave to you and left with us you would have done better on a set with a director who respected more of your talents rather than with feig who lowered your standardsi think this movie will make some money and make a few people moderately wealthy  but the question remains should this movie have been made at all,comedy
heres a movie that struggles between genres it is billed as a comedy but has a level of violence that is not funny mccarthy plays a female mr bean character as a secret agentthe movie is too long and drags at times the dialogue is so peppered with f bombs that just keep coming it seems like lazy writing when so many characters have nothing to say but the f word there were some interesting locations and some locations that looked like the fox lot there is a good twist that almost saves the movie it doesnt have enough laughs and by the time they stick a knife through a hand you just cant wait for this to enddont spend a lot of money to see this in a theater it will play just as badly in a home platform,comedy
susan cooper works as a deskbound cia agent shes the mouth piece for her field agent bradley fine but when he is killed by a beautiful femme fatale rayna boyanov she agrees to go undercover as carol jenkins and take her down her initial mission leads her to paris where she needs to take a bomb away from a crime group including boyanov ably assisted by colleague and friend nancy she has to show her metalthis and kingsman were movies that i was desperate to watch i must say i loved them both hopefully this will start a new wave of james bond inspired comedies funny from start to finish i absolutely loved it it felt similar to kingsman if im being honest the most random moment of all was seeing that ukranian eurovision song contest entry from a few years back never thought id ever be seeing that againmelissa mccarthy has ridiculously good comic timing she is naturally funny and her genius is put to great use in this film a truly hilarious woman she manages to be funny and totally lovable too miranda hart was an unexpected treat very funny adding a different slant to the humour as nancy jason statham was utterly brilliant he always plays the same type of character wonderful to see him sending himself upjust a fun movie you can watch and rewatch 810,comedy
there are a few laughs and funny situations early in the movie but then it gets rather strange after about the first third of the movie the only thing that draws laughs is the overuse of the f word by everyone in the film melissa mccarthy changes from the drab analyst to deadly agent in a flash besides being unbelievable she suddenly becomes a trash talking confident secret agent rose byrne is ok with a deadpan delivery but seems to try too hard to play the rich b i was bored and shaking my head through the whole second half of the movie because of the stupidity if your idea of a fun movie is counting the number of f bombs this movie is for you otherwise i would wait for the video and not waste my money at the theater,comedy
an appalling and distasteful movie i simply could not bear this movie for two minutes at a time the worst 130 minutes of my life incredibly stupid and highly unrealistic there are several moments when youd hope  pray that the protagonist might be shot dead so that the movie would get over soonthere are several movies like this one for instance beverly hills ninja those are guaranteed to make you laugh but this movie just makes you wanna gouge your eyes out this is a movie that never should have been madeand what is wrong with jason statham did he have to keep his balls stored away in a pickle jar for the entire duration the movie was shot to be very feminine if you dont get what i mean whatever the money he got out from this movie wasnt worth flushing his career down the drainsince when did gigantic prosthetic dicks become a regular comedy theme i dont see any giant prosthetic female genitals on screen as a joke bloody double standard damn you hollywoodthe movie titanic has only 77 and this has 71 what the bloody hell i have lost all hopes for hollywood and my trust for imdb looks like anybody can pay a couple of dollars to imdb to pump up the ratings,comedy
thats according to one other reviewer who states that anyone who loves film would not rate this higher than one star and while our taste in movies is different and comedy is something that will be viewed differently by anyone watching i think its a big mistake calling out people and suggesting things like thatin other words whether you liked this or not it doesnt mean people who disagree with you got paid or have no sense of humor having said and written all that i think melissa mccarthy is doing a great job and as a friend of mine said though i did like the heat with her and sandra bullock too this one steps up on the stunts front too there are some genuine great action scenes in thisand jason statham is terrific in spoofing himself to put it pg words something you wont get in this movie by the way  theres a reason its rated r and its mostly because of the language used but in general this is really a movie about women and i love the fact that they are getting some really good well written roles in this you might not agree with the lineshumor but you cant fault the fact that they put them out there taking lead and being really good at itto tell you the truth im almost surprised nobody called out feminism with this one something that seems to be popular in 2015 see also mad max fury road but if you dont mind and you shouldnt and this kind of does meet your sense of humor you will have a great time,comedy
wow 72 seriously well in my lowly and wretched opinion it is enough to make me completely lose faith in the ratings here at imdb honestly and im swearing by everything holy believe me i havent seen such mindlessly idiotic dialog since i tried to watch the call with halle berry now i am talking mainstream big films here movies with big stars and a fair amount of money behind them and up to that film i had figured that that was just about the worst most horribly written mainstream film that i had attempted to watch up to that time well im sorry to say people but we have a new winnerhow is it even bloody possible for this film to have even the good reviews that is has i always check the external reviews when im considering spending time to watch a film and ill be damned if i didnt read a few good sounding reviews i think even at bluraycom who is usually very dependable for reviews well not this time let me tell youokay i will admit that the opening credits were pretty damn sharp minus the earbleeding song of course geez and the action stuff at the beginning was great but imagine my total amazement when people started opening their mouths and actually saying something i say again wow the back and forth between mccarthy and jude law was just about the absolute worst dialog that i would ever expect in a big film like this how the hell does that happen i mean really i suppose that it was meant to be funny and any dialog even when they were meeting together to decide what to do and if it is even conceivable inconceivable princess bride for it to get any worse the dialog between mccarthy and her friend at work was unspeakably and utterly awful im being honest here people i cannot possibly convey to you how shockingly bad it waswhew after reading some clearly misleading reviews and after trying to stomach the first 45 minutes of this film i felt that it was my sacred duty to my fellow man and woman and i suppose transgenders to come here and write what i truly felt about this movieand you know it is really a damn shame too because i did think that the idea and premise were quite brilliant really but the only thing that i can think of and the only thing that comes to mind as to how the hell this could even have been so horribly bad is that maybe the idea was green lighted so quickly and the powers that be wanted it out and released so damn fast that it was literally impossible to have enough time to write it properly so what it appears like is a great idea that was friggn rushed to the screen that is truly the only thing that i can think of how this could have happened you can see too from just the 3 or 4 reviews immediately before mine chronologically how some people felt they were all 1 star ratings yes one star and their comments are scathingly badi guess when it comes to what the studios expect to be a blockbuster all i can figure is that they must have literally thousands of minions coming here and writing false reviews i mean when i saw the 72 i literally laughed my ss off thats why im having to stand right nowso fwiw i feel that i added at least my honest impression of the film i am just so blown away because so far this is truly the most extreme and egregious example that ive seen here on imdb of a rating absolutely and categorically not fitting the quality of the film at allim giving it a 3 only because the initial bond style stuff and the opening credits were pretty bitchn but trust me that was it,comedy
there are a few laughs but theyre towards the beginning and they follow predictably from the movies premise after about 80 minutes running time is 2 hours the movie devolves into a tedium of fight scenes car chases and uninspired foul language the fight scenes are excessively dubbed for comedic value will audiences never tire of the kneetothegroinwithacrunchingsound gag but there really isnt a lower level of humor than thatalso the blatant product placement for bmw is obnoxious and what 50 cent is doing in the movie is anybodys guess the fact that a film that ultimately approximates nothing so much as bad television can meet with such widespread critical acclaim is itself an indictment of our absurd era,comedy
i didnt have very high hopes for it but who knew jason statham can do comedy in his style this destroyed all my stereotypes about movies its a real fun way to relax enjoydont buy into those crappy reviews this is not a classical masterpiece a well made good laughmelissa mccarthy is very good i think this is her bestand a good start studded cast this films brings jokes out of nowhere kudos to the directorwriterproducerthis really deserves 7 in imdb,comedy
the movie is boring funny at some points another example of how money can twist the truth imdb rating is now useless reviewing with minimum 10 lines is useless imdb need to come up with something like giving some accounts reliable and more points when giving rating than just some random accounts people just wanna know if theyre wasting time watching it this is absolutely not 7 its definitely below 5 the movie is boring funny at some points another example of how money can twist the truth imdb rating is now useless reviewing with minimum 10 lines is useless imdb need to come up with something like giving some accounts reliable and more points when giving rating than just some random accounts people just wanna know if theyre wasting time watching it this is absolutely not 7 its definitely below 5,comedy
huahahaha this movie is really really really funny seriously got a lot of lols while watching this movie exactly in almost every scene wow its been so long i never laugh till my stomach hurts this movie is so much better than the heat all the characters here are funny even the supporting characters i like seeing the chemistry between melissa mccharty and rose byrne i hope there will be 2then i checked the review here the rating itself is good anyway wow i cant believe there are so many people giving negative review about this movie that i have to think maybe those are reviews from the same person who hate this movie or anything related to this movie come on all just negative reviews until page 5 whats so dragging about this movie okay maybe we just have a different taste of comedy whatever case closed but i just love this movie very very much once again i hope there will be 2 soon,comedy
im not usually a humor movie kind of person but this movie really drew me in it had something special a sexy charm a wonderful cast and lots of action albeit preposterous i really liked it and i plan to watch it again my favorite character was aldo i have known guys like him and they are always interestingi must add that i saw an edited version of this movie so it probably didnt contain the raunchier scenes other reviewers described i thought the movie was teetering on the edge of objectionable as it was so the unedited version might have been too much for me definitely not a movie for under 21,comedy
paul feigs continues to showcase the talents of melissa mccarthys admirably zealous performing abilities as an actress love her or hate her mccarthy is a comic force of nature breathlessly going from a mild and calm demeanor to a racier more hotheaded temper in almost no time is best divided into two acts separated by the hour mark with the first hour showing mccarthys mannered side while showing her unleash her fury during the second its quite an interesting mix and provides for a rather unexpectedly reversal wasnt really marketed on vulgarian principles like the heat and tammy werehowever theres less charming about than i was ready to report this is a film that simply shows the same brand of mccarthy humor weve seen before unabashedly raunchy sometimes to a fault and burdened by a very hit or miss array of jokes along the way feig and mccarthy yet again seem to be spitballing ideas here trying to find what works for her in the vein of physical comedy dialog and situational events and finding a ground thats more solid than the terribly loose tammy but less appealing than the chemistrydriven heat its a hodgepodge of epic proportions in terms of the direction of its humor along with being seriously confused about its presentation as an actioncomedythe story revolves around melissa mccarthys susan cooper a cia analystdesk jockey who helps guide her fellow agent bradley fine jude law on missions watching his every move through computers and assisting him in compromising predicaments the cia is in search of a nuke bomb suitcase and upon failing to recover it during fines efforts in bulgaria and his subsequent death susan is sent undercover to find and identify rayna boyanov rose byrne the daughter of the man responsible for the nuke bomb suitcase susan is sent undercover because of fear that rayna and her family are aware of the other spies in the cia like the pompous knowitall rick ford jason statham who quits in frustration upon susan being allowed to partake in the mission susans boss elaine crocker allison janney winds up agreeing to her mission and before long susan becomes penny morgan a middleaged woman touring in paris working to get close to rayna before the nuke bomb is detonatedweve seen these same tropes before in action films gone past where there is some sort of fabled device up for grabs by numerous different parties and police are summoned or somebody is sent undercover at first recognizes that its essentially operating on wellcharted territory and decides to toy with the general quips and clichs of the genre however just about the same time the script decides to amplify melissa mccarthys vulgarian tendencies the film begins to play the same quips it was satirizing we never really know whether or not we should be laughing with or at and that poses a big problem for the tone of the filmagain mccarthy can be admirable at certain times in the film but overall theres a dreary sense of familiarity with her performances weve seen mccarthy be the toughest woman on screen before and her characters have all run threadbare in terms of being able to be anything other than occasionally hardheaded or amiable to a fault between this and feig trying to throw mccarthy into every comic situation possible including some very unfunny and absurdly long scenes involving peter serafinowiczs character trying to molest susan at every turn and we just have another comedy trying way too hard to be funnycan however claim to have a very strong cast of supporting characters specifically byrne and janney both of whom do very capable work here byrne continues to explore her wellrounded character actress principles janney delivers her wonderfully cold deadpan humor and statham gives an innocuous performance that dreads carefully along the lines of self parody but between s identity crisis as a film mccarthys tired schtick i long to see her work in a dramatic film where i think shed be wonderfully capable perhaps pulling a robin williamsesque reversal on naysayers and the inevitable muchness that begins to overtake the film as a whole and theres a lot burdening that undermines the strong talent on display here,comedy
i wonder what some of these people were expecting when they gave this movie a 110 its a comedy movie infused with otherwise serious characters like law  stratham being goofy and acting the fool the things that were coming out of strathams mouth with a serious face made the movie some of these critiques need to relax and enjoy a silly comedy movie as what it was designed for you did not go in thinking this is some critically acclaimed serious movie like 12 years a slave did you its exactly how you all sound with all that bitterness it cracks me up how some people can be such sour grapes about a comedy movie it doesnt have to be high iq mind bending thought provoking or have a profound plot to it it just has to be funny stop bashing mccarthy about low self esteem and how she shamed herself etc it is precisely because she is confident in what she does she has no problem making fun of herself it is what comedians do because its funny if you who were so angry to have wasted time  money watching this i suggest you keep being miserable and stop wasting either of those precious commodity watching a light hearted movie to laugh silly with a friend,comedy
i decided to watch this movie because of jason statham and i saw the ratings were pretty good tooas i began to watch it it was clear that its suppose to be a movie parody the beginning was actually not bad so my expectations were that it should be at list somewhat entertaining but the next 95 of the movie proved me wrongthe plot is extremely generic and without any creative expression at all most of the scenes are boring at best and really cringy and obnoxious the jokes are either sexual or plain cursing and insults but not in a funny way at all only a couple of scenes gave me a degree of entertainment when rick ford brags about himself and when the security guy anthony gets shot maybe something else all of the rest was making it difficult to watch the characters were boring as well the action is not top notch but its alright but it doesnt even come close to making up for the rest the production itself is good but it would be a crime if it wasnt with a 65 million budgetin conclusion there was potential to this movie but they flushed it in the sewer where the level of the movie is as well i recommend not to watch this movie and not to waste time on it,comedy
this movie makes me laugh everytimeimo melissas bestalison is soo funnymiranda tooi wish it took more money at cinema so we could have a sequelid love to see rebel wilson join the cast,comedy
i saw at a sxsw screening beneath the violence and the swears i wanted to find a funny movie but the shallow story bland characters pull down s pants one those it cant pull up in its runtime melissa mccarthy is brilliantly gut punchingly awesome as susan cooper an overweight but badass all the others jude law jason transporter statham and rose byrne give good performances to hold up the movie director paul feigs previous flick bridesmades had better use of the comedy and themes it held byrnes finicky villain is good but she wants to be a good one than a bad villain jude law breaks his luck by giving a solid performance transporter statham gives an unusually good act overall paul feigs crooked direction the hammy story and twists pull down this film from its potential but it is a one time watch for mccarthy fans who will enjoy the movie only for her 510 ,comedy
melissa mccarthy and paul feig do it again i swear when you get this director and this hilarious comedic actress together you just cant fail the writing is really what makes this movie when you compare the hilarious comedic script with such great actors that can deliver the lines well you just cant make a bad movie melissa is of course the perfect actress to play such a hilarious and many times endearing role who can also be a pretty big badass when she needs to be and one really important ingredient to this movies comedy is miranda hart there wasnt a single scene where she was speaking that i wasnt doubled over laughing she plays a very lovable best friend character to melissa mccarthy jude law and jason statham are also here playing side characters and theyre good in their roles its a very different role for statham hes never really done comedy its usually all hardcore action for him but i thought he did pretty well even though he wasnt in his comfort zone rose byrne is here and i loved her comedic side shown in both neighbors and bridesmaid she really is a very hilarious actress and theres further proof of that statement here in the action is pretty good even though thats not what i watched it for all in all if youre expecting a well made hilarious melissa mccarthy action comedy movie then thats exactly what youre going to get 910 for ,comedy
the first half of the movie was entertaining enough but the overall effort gets dragged down by a screenplay that seemed written by a team of 9th grade boys who suddenly realized they could drop an fbomb any time they want you can tell when a comedy is desperate when it resorts to this tactic and resort certainly does by the end of this carpet fbombing i found myself more dazed than amused even when it tries for a sight gag or joke to make you laugh its something youve seen before in a similar and incredibly better heavy funny person turned hero movie such as paul blart i or ii admittedly i havent seen pb ii but it has to be better bottom line youd be better served for laughs by a mike and molly rerun,comedy
reading through the user reviews of this movie a lot of the watchers seem to be very upset that there is a lot swearing they feel it is unsuitable for children and not family friendlythis is all true but people this movie is rated r if you dont want to watch a movie for adults then check the rating first dont blame the movie for that and if you are insulted by cursing then watch one of the thousands of other movies available to you instead of down voting an r rated movie for having swear words in itthat aside i thought the movie was very very funny i enjoyed how statham and to a lesser extent law both play unself aware idiots to great comic effect i enjoyed the arc of mccarthys character moving from smart but lacking in confidence back office worker to kick ass it was silly and hilarious 50 cent was funny tooas a brit i also enjoyed the appearances from miranda hart and peter serafinowicz who are well known faces on comedy tv here but not really in hollywoodlaugh out loud funny all the way through highly recommended,comedy
really spoiled what could have been a great movie with all of the foul language made it to the plane scene and that was it i was surprised that this was rated r and thought it was because of nudity boy was i wrong directors there is nothing uglier than a pretty woman with a foul mouth why cant hollywood set the example that a movie can be funny exciting engaging and a joy without the lousy lkanguage we were soldiers and mision impossible both had no foul language wanna have a block buster and after market sales clean it up i really hate having to write 10 lines about this guess i wil have to just watch pixar movies,comedy
wasnt sure about this film at first as i am not a big of melissa mccarthy but glad i watched it havent laughed so much watching comedy compared to this one melissa is a good actor and rather funny too jason statham jude law and rose byrne being in it was also an added bonus dont understand why others were giving this film a 1 rating as it isnt bad at all give it a go of you have nothing else to watch,comedy
saturday 6 june 2015 my wife and i went to see melissa mccarthy and jason stathams new action comedy movie the movie was funny but way to much unnecessary hard core profanity this movie could have been just as funny without all the bad language cute rose byrne action star jason statham and very pretty morena baccarin all made a good cast but the cursing every minute brought my rating of the movie way down lots of crude profanity does not make a movie funnya few weeks ago my wife and i saw kevin james in paul blart mall cop2 and it was more funnier than and without all the crude absurd unnecessary hard core profanity which proves that a movie can be funny without a lot of cursing i have always liked kevin since his tv show and his movies hitch and here comes the boom which he was very funny in both the cursing was so much over done at one point i had thought of walking out and asking for a refund or to see another movie melissa is good as a comedy actress but she needs to tone the profanity way down,comedy
before i stepped into the theater it was impossible to avoid the accolades this film had been getting some calling it the funniest movie of the year so far so suffice to say my expectations were high allow me to cut to the chase something id wished wouldve done for the first 45 minutes i didnt laugh at all and it wasnt until the arrival of rose byrne one hour into the movie that i felt hit any kind of consistent comedic stride and even then when later sequences would lack the mccarthy v byrne argumentative visual this paul feig comedy left much to be desired synopsis bradley fine jude law is a charismatic cia field agent and susan melissa mccarthy is in the friend zoneand also technically a cia agent although relegated to the office but when all of the field agents names become public knowledge susan gets a chance to save the day by becoming an actual field agent and then comedy ensues is a james bond satire from the spot on opening credits to the extremely well choreographed fight sequences feig has done his homework here leaving no doubt that he could direct a 007 film if ever called upon but those who proclaim this to be a comedic gem the caliber of an austin powers international man of mystery are very much fooling themselves problems arise rather quickly as the initial myriad of running gags fall flat first and foremost a reoccurring vermin infestation joke which didnt work the first or 50th time after that this movies downfall can be more evenly distributed between an actress named miranda hart who plays the annoying best friendsidekick and writerdirector paul feigs comedic joke telling abilities or lack thereofeven though mccarthy has transformed into the female equivalent of will farrell with her character remaining the same from film to film she is not the problem here the main problem seems to stem from a combination of bad joke writing and leaving her as the main focal point on screen for too long heres the thing just like farrell mccarthy works best as a sidekick or at the very least paired in a duo and thus when byrne comes on screen she becomes that lifesaver which rescues this film from drowning a very quiet death but if feig already knew having worked with mccarthy on the heat and bridesmaids what we the audience already knew why does it take so long for her to get any help why must we watch mccarthy flounder about in open water for a cringeworthy amount of time final thought i may get some flak from people who claim i am some kind of paul feig hater as this is his third film in a row which has received a lukewarm response from this reviewer and though i do believe there is an audience for feigs repetitive watered down judd apatow form of slapstick it is now my belief that this filmmaker uses the women empowermentstrong female lead angle as a crutch to mask the fact that his movies are simply not that funny in the same way tyler perry uses minorities as his leads and heavy christian themes in an attempt to mask the fact that his stories are exploitative trash that said still contains comedic pockets which rise above the norm its just a shame that is a perfect example of too little too late,comedy
gotta love melissa mccarthy she gets it done with class style humor and just enough slapstick to keep the movie flowing most big girl movies come across as stupid and condescending but this one makes her look tough without any of the normal fat girl clichs jude law was delicious as always but i wanted to give him some chapstick through the entire movie did he get his lip done or something not sure but still adorable loved the well placed plot twist that really made the movie wrap things up jason stathamwho doesnt love him bad boy turned lovable dork nothing gets better than that unforeseen star of the movie was miranda hart what a perfect cagney to melissas lacy they make a great thelma and louise i can see them working together again saving the world one asthma attack at a time,comedy
this movie is not funnybut that might not be its biggest problem it is horribly inconsistent in tone it does not know what it wants to be a comedy or an action movie and even when it does pick one of those genres it doesnt know what kind of comedy it wants to be toilet humor and language more salty than south park or a slapstick pg movie where the main character pratfalls all over the placeanother major point of inconsistency are the main characters abilities are they super spies or bumbling buffoons it is impossible to tell and they switch from moment to moment sometimes more than once in a minutes timewatch johnny english or the man who knew too little for far better examples of this type of comedic movie,comedy
the often brilliant melissa mccarthy is on top of her game as the mousy susan cooper a behindthescenes cia agent who finds herself struggling to prove herself in the fieldthe movie is rather similar to bob hope movies like my favorite brunette in which he found himself taking on a more exciting life he isnt completely prepared for like hope mccarthy will be incredibly incompetent when that can get the laughs but other times prove herself as able as more stereotypical heroes although unlike most hope movies mccarthy plays someone who stars with some level of competencethe cast is excellent with jude law doing a fine james bond impression and very funny performances from miranda hart as a goofy fellow agent and peter serafinowicz as a sleazebagthere is also a bit of a feminist theme here with the movie mocking masculine jerks particularly jason stathams insane egotist there is also some surprisingly solid action most notably a jackiechan influenced kitchen fightwhile the movie is funny and wellacted the plot leaves something to be desired it holds together most of the way but towards the end the writers toss logic out the window and dont even really try to justify whats going onsome people are complaining that this movie is foulmouthed im assuming these people live in small towns where jimmy stewart runs the local savings and loan and the beaver is always getting into trouble i found it all very funny,comedy
in this actioncomedy directed by paul feig who brought us bridesmaids 2011 and the heat 2013 melissa mccarthy plays susan cooper a cia analyst who takes on a dangerous mission with her partner bradley fine played by jude law to capture an international terrorist named sergio de luca played by bobby cannevale who is in possession of nuclear weapons when the mission goes terribly wrong cooper is partner with rayna boyanov played by rose byrne the daughter of one of de lucas henchmen assigned to travel to paris undercover and stop the mastermind terrorist herself jason statham plays rick ford an arrogant secret agent who disagrees with coopers position as the undercover agent on the mission and stops at nothing to find de luca and finish the mission himself with hilarious melissa mccarthy comedies like bridesmaids and the heat i had much confidence in this film especially upon watching the trailer with jude laws character accidentally shooting a terrorist after sneezing unfortunately my expectations sadly fell short there is no denying that there were some funny scenes with melissa mccarthy and rose byrne but not very many the chemistry between these two felt rather weak and ineffective the humor and dialogue is in this film is a bit stale and the problem is that this movie tries to be funny by constantly using nonstop expletives without adding any real humor to them and it just doesnt work characters using vulgar sex humor is not problem as long as they make them in a way that is funny sadly the film fails to accomplish this the characters just swear in a way that serves no purpose jason statham doesnt even manage to be funny in this either dont get wrong there is some shades of humor here and there but enough to make it satisfying is not what i would describe as a bad movie but rather a movie that wasted lots of potential on a poorly written script melissa mccarthy may enjoy this some will not there were a few scenes that had me laughing but overall i was quite disappointed in this,comedy
melissa mccarthy has been americas finest comedienne ever since she knocked us all out with her allhandsondeck supporting performance in 2011s bridesmaids not a lucy nor a rosalind mccarthy has always gone down and dirty packing her yearly schedule with comedy parts built around her foul mouthed persona but after a few too many misses such as inexplicably highgrossing identity thief or critical disaster tammy one has begun to associate mccarthy with a wig and a greasy part embodying a character better equipped for a saturday night live skit than a full length movie finally we have a vehicle worthy of her talents is the best comedy of the year one shouldnt be saying such things until december i know but i doubt ill find another romp as packed with belly laughs as this one i havent laughed this hard or this uninterruptedly for months and im not being overly dramatic  with increasing embarrassment i found tears streaming down my face quite often doing everything possible to quiet down potentially obnoxious laughing fits its been a month since the film was released  the theater was hardly packed  but it was clear that the people around me were in similar states of shock this is a comedy worth celebrating as soon as i left the theater i wanted to see it again pardon the clich theres a reason we have themin mccarthy portrays susan cooper a cia analyst who spends her days acting as the welltrained ear to 007esque field agent bradley fine jude law shes been stuck at her desk for years aiding him on each and every mission  its only inevitable that she a lonely heart who hasnt been in a relationship for a while  fall for his charming ways but after an incident leaves him out of the picture susan realizes that she would make for a good she is knowledgeable when it comes to the field and knows quite a bit of self defensereluctantly her supervisor allison janney agrees with her suggestion sending her to paris to thwart a terrorism plot involving powerful criminals sergio de luca bobby cannavale and rayna boyanov rose byrne constantly interrupting the mission is rick ford jason statham a rogue agent who lets his ego get in the way of successful plotting though initially nervous susan finds herself thrilled by her new job  she might even be dare she say it better than fine paul feig the man behind bridesmaids and the heat mixes action and comedy with such skill that we almost forget that seeing mccarthy convincingly fist fight with a baddie should seem strange  but mccarthy thanks to a terrific comedic performance and feigs screenplay is never anything less than a wrecking ball of laughs she can sell a barbed insult as well as she can make the most of her initially mousy faade  mccarthy is one of the greatest comedy actors of the 2010s its easy to forget that fact when she heads bombs but when films like come along we begin to realize just how wrong we were to ever underestimate her for once though mccarthy is not the only actor providing the majority of our abdominal pain the responsibility is shared by a fantastic sometimes surprisingly so ensemble byrne an underappreciated straight woman murders her role as the bighaired villainous miranda hart as mccarthys ear is a fine combination of bumbling and shrill janneys no nonsense portrayal provides for some of the most hardhitting laughs in the film but best is shockingly statham who lampoons his image so hilariously one can only wonder whats been keeping him out of the comedy world all these yearsi loved i dont go to the theaters often  money you see is too sacred to constantly spend on entertainment  but i havent had this much fun in the cinema chair for what feels like years sometimes its good to laugh until you cry sometimes its good to want to turn around and see the movie all over again netflix is cheaper i know but dont wait to see go out on the town with your friends ending your night with it i guarantee youll still be laughing for the next few days,comedy
ok melissa mccarthy is funny she has her scenes where you laugh out loud so badly that your stomach starts to crunch up hoping that this movie would cause the same reaction wasnt asking for much i mean bridesmaids the heat and mike and molly provide this reaction quite often i hate to say it but this movie did not provide enough laughs to cause this reaction unfortunately melissas chemistry with the fellow actors statham law and hart provided some spark throughout the movie but i was reminded to often about the lack of well written characters what was stathams relevance in this movie in the trailers he was portrayed as acting sideby side with mccarthy but this wasnt the case statham was a nobody throughout the film and probably couldve been left out the worst issue with this film is that it was very predictable from the beginning to the end i knew exactly what was going to happen without giving out any spoilers i knew that it would end like that if you want to laugh maybe 15 minutes or so during a film and not care much about the actual story then this film if for you for all the others who want an actual storyline with characters that matter skip this one and wait for a real melissa mccarthy comedy to come out,comedy
ok so this looks like an interesoh my god its another bloody bond parody seriously yes the modern age feminist hipster paul feig takes a swing at the bond genre and oh what an original concept that is gee i wonder what well see hereughso naturally its an adult comedy with lashings of semiserious action cgi blood swearing and a whole heap of melissa mccarthy and other actresses basically the plot revolves around mccarthy playing cooper a desk jockey cia analyst who helps the very suave completely clichd character of fine played by jude law yep if you ever wanted to see what it would be like having jude law as bond well here you go after a botched mission fine is supposedly killed off and the cia need someone to take his place an unknown hence they cant use statham who plays another totally clichd agent character weve all seen before we then follow cooper around as she slowly but surely sinks deeper and deeper into a mission which she was never really suppose to get into in the first place she was only meant to be surveillanceoh geez where to start the plot is unoriginal sure we all know that but how about some original ideasoh too late from the very first scene i had a good idea what this film was aiming at and how the characters would play out spoiler alert but the minute you see law as this debonair you know hes obviously gonna die early on hes clearly the plot setup for mccarthys cooper i mean come on who didnt see that but wait as the film progresses and more and more characters are introduced we start to see double agents and characters popping up outta nowhere who are suddenly spies or assassins all of sudden characters we saw at the start who appeared to just be the butt of a joke or background fodder are now main characters out to kill the protagonist its at this point you know that anyone is fair game and anyone can surprisingly come back from the dead when you thought they had been killed off so i quickly realised that jude law probably wasnt dead at all seeing as we didnt actually see him die clearly he can come back and he didgroanthe plot is a mess of characters bouncing back and forth between the goodies and the baddies seriously there are characters popping up all over the place getting whacked and then replaced minutes later by new ones only to get killed just as quickly the ones that dont get killed you just know are probably gonna turn out to be secret agents but on either side i honesty thought laws character of fine was gonna keep flippin sides he was a goodie then a baddie then a goodie again but at this point i genuinely suspected he would turn on cooper yet again right at the death and then get properly killed off amazingly the film beat me on that one but this film could of kept spinning these characters round and round one double agent twist after anotherthe actual characters are a completely mixed bag of nuts that all had one thing in common none of them managed to actually make me laughat any point mccarthy waswell pretty much like mccarthy is in every bloody movie shes ever done whilst looking oddly like dawn french at one point whilst her sidekick played by brit miranda hart was just simply annoying and unfunny i swear an early scene near the start has mccarthy and law in conversation at dinner they are both talking about themselves and offering basic foreshadowing of things to come now initially there are moments that made me smile as there were throughout this film but this obviously intended funny sequence just went on and on and onit just didnt fcking stop like seriously the moment has passed the joke is over its not funny anymore its just awkwardly embarrassing stop flogging this dead horsethe only characters that did offer some genuine giggles were statham as a dumb cocky but tough agent nothing gobsmackingly funny mind you but reasonable next to him i quite liked peter serafinowicz as the slimy italian yet another secret agent aldo who cant keep his hands off the ladies sure this character felt like a cheesy carry on character something i would of thought was beyond the realms of acceptance for feig but his antics were amusing other than that everyone was just there doing exactly what you expected them to be doing with these character types get a load of law by the way how much flippin makeup oh and both statham and the main baddie fall into the lake from that helicopter at the end so why does only statham survivei know this movie was relatively successful but i dont really understand why yes some parts were good such as the gadgets sequence near the start which is obviously yet more parodies of a certain franchise and i did quite like how the main female villain was a spoilt bratty princess type although again that did become annoying at times too but in general everything just felt very generic to me and relied far too much on feeble visual gags including male genitals and slapstick lots of profanity and lots of weightlooks shaming jabs even the inclusion of lots of blood and a bit of gore didnt do anything for me that just felt unnecessary and shoved in to appease the male audience i would say this was more enjoyable than the heat which was pretty dire but at the end of the day i found this to be an infantile factory assembly line cookie cutter of a flick4510,comedy
popular but witless lunkheaded actioncomedy starvehicle for melissa mccarthy whose reign as the female adam sandler shows no signs of slowing downher budgets keep getting bigger yet her fbombheavy scripts are growing dimmer mccarthy plays cia employee susan cooper a deskjockey and onetime promising trainee whose crush on a field agent gets her involved in his latest lifeanddeath case concerning the daughter of an arms dealer whos incahoots with terrorists mccarthys shtickthe withering barrage of egodeflating putdowns peppered with expletivesstill gets laughs but here the comedienne is nearly swallowed up by the ridiculously complicated plot and busy direction both of which are more exhausting than hilarious writerdirector paul feig obviously adores his starand indeed the picture would be absolutely nothing without herbut surrounding mccarthy with snipers and bombs of the exploding variety or putting her in a kill billstyled fight scene probably sounded a lot better than it plays out supporting cast including jason statham jude law rose byrne allison janney and 50 cent  looks properly embarrassed miranda hart playing an overeager nerd shows some comedic flair but doesnt have the funny lines to put her role over  from ,comedy
this was one of the best films i have seen in a long time the movie will have you laughing from the beginning to the end every character and storyline is well thought out its not a film where you see female spies running in high heels or dressed for prom while still a comedy it does not leave the audience feeling intellectually insulted the comedy and writing was great enough but this is one of the first films where you actually see an equal distribution of male and female actorsit is not just an androcentric viewpoint but much more realistic most films with female protagonist usually make the mistake of using one or two main female character while the rest are still male this one has male and female characters evenly distributed in all roles paul feig did an amazing job,comedy
the people who did not enjoy this movie either have no sense of humor whatsoever or they have a huge stick up their butt this movie kept me laughing the entire time i had no idea jason stathom could be so funny if you want to see a movie just for the enjoyment of it this is the one i think the people on here who didnt like it must have been looking for some deep epic movie instead of a comedy the lines that melissa mccarthy and jason stathom pull off with straight faces are comedic genius i admit the addition of 50 cent is a bit odd but even that ends up being funny relax people take it for what it is  a comedy stop looking for some deep dark meaning and then complaining when you dont find one and all the people referencing melissa mccarthys weight have a problem,comedy
hollywood has a film for you she is a spook yeah taht is spookyif you enjoy big women also consider ghostbusters the last jedi and of course shallow hal,comedy
feigs take on the james bonds of the genre is impeccably impressive with faulty gadgets dull mobile questionable action sequences and slow chase scenes whod have thought that compilation of these disasters is whats going to elevate the film into a hilarious zone his film shines only when he fumbles deliberately though and his commitment on mapping out that entire structure for the sake of a laugh is surprisingly admirable the plot is his weak point though whenever the storyline advances further there is a sense of disappointment in the air as you want to stay on that lane only and enjoy it thoroughly as much as possibleand this makes the last act a bit low on humor for the time was running and feig had to bring out the news table where the flips and the turns and petty twists are barely the highlight of it the physical sequences that it thrives upon is carried out brilliantly by mccarthy she is just delightful to watch body shaming herself and demoralizing others with her uncouth language she makes you fall out of your chair as you burst out with a roaring laughtersupporting him thoroughly on that very note is statham as a boasting guy that praises himself with various references that just keeps getting funnier and funnier personally his amiability to keep himself superior than others steals away the show for me law byrne and hart gets few lines to draw in the laughs but another surprising winner is serafinowicz as a constant flirt in the screen that charms his way out no matter what mccarthy says his petty notions might get by unnoticed but his absence plays a much vital role is the least a ever can be or pretend to be but there is no secret that the laughter comes in handy in here,comedy
was a decent parody of typical films and has a few laughs jason statham was definitely my favourite part often making fun of characters he has played before this genuinely made me laugh quite a few timesrose byrne as one of the villains was great as well overall the acting was quite good from everyone nobody ruined any parts of the film with their performances some of the cinematography was good nothing phenomenal though however some jokes did fall flat or were just over used the film does try to parody films but ends up sticking to common tropes instead of commenting on them i would think adding more commentary on these tropes would add to the comedic tone and maybe give more heart to it but not every film needs to do this definitely give it a chance you may be surprised,comedy
this is hardly the first or last parody movie some nail it johnny english and some miss badly the austin powers sequels this one was just plain perfect theres nothing original but every cast member  mccarthy especially  nails every part comedies like this work best with real characters and unreal plots paul feig clearly gets that i laughed a lot,comedy
unassuming analyst for the cia susan coopermelissa mccarthyhas her wildest dreams come true as she volunteers to go undercover in this james bond spoof susan has worked diligently with her partner bradley finejude law tracking and guiding him on his missions when fine is either killed or just missing in action miss cooper is the only agenton paperthat has not had their identity compromised by an international arms dealers organization the improbable assignment has a tenured agent rick fordjason stathamresign in disgust but his jealousy and ego will have him try to spoil coopers investigation and search for the missing agent and find the location of the arms dealersome heavy action along with situational and sight gags plenty of foul language that at times is too much and offputting i do have to admit i found a role by mccarthy i actually liked she by all means is not your typical image of a leading ladymatter of opinion of course stathams role is nothing for him to be very proud ofrounding out the cast raad rawl rose byrne sam richardson miranda hart jessica chaffin and allison janney,comedy
i was reluctant to go but then was happy i did the cast is brilliant especially melissa is making the movie worthwhile i was really not sure about the plot but the twists in action witty comments and the plot keep you entertaining for the whole time i cant wait to buy a dvd actually all the people in the cinema were laughing hard for the entire duration of the movie so good will keep recommending to family and friends there were many scenes where the unexpected happened and the unexpected was said making you laugh with tears in your eyes the main character plays this middle aged woman who decides to change her life running after a potential love and things dont turn out quite as she imagined her friend is so funny too realky worth watching if you want to go to the cinema and have a good laugh then you should highly recommended,comedy
previews for this movie made it look fun and initially it was as well as a pretty good james bond spoof it could have easily been made with a pg13 rating and teens would have loved it an underlying message could be empowering for women andor the overweightinitially i thought ok i can put up with ricks constant profanity most significantly the fword because he was such a jerk but about halfway through the film it seems the original writers quit and were replaced by illiterate buffoons whose vocabulary is limited to the fword and some of its variations tiresome and disturbing the addition of bathroom humor and sexual innuendo was distracting and unnecessarymccarthy does a good job and her character is refreshing except for the pottymouth the plot twists are good and the humor is genuine the film seems to go on a bit too long to suit me but maybe thats because i got so tired of so much profanitythis could have been a decent comedy for families at least those with older children i dont see why the producers chose to limit their audience and offend some of the rest of us the liberal use of the fword adds nothing to the film and detracts from what could have been a good comedyspoof that seems to be lacking these days,comedy
the comedy in the movie is great the movie did a great job on entertaining the audience and it makes it a fun movie i was shocked because the serious actors that we knew in other movies is very funny the movie is probably not the most funny film but it is entertaining throughout the moviethere is violence comedy and action the setting is great camera angles are fine lighting is good and acting is a bit weird for some but its still okay if you had a bad day i recommend watching this movie for good vibes it makes your mood better,comedy
that sums it up for meall the characters were awesome and the action is pretty good yes perhaps some of the humour is crass or gross but it is still funny i found it also a nice coming of age story i know she is nominally an adult but as she says she fundamentally hid where her mother wanted her to hide in a basement blending in and letting others win the characters and their interactions are great in particular like other have said jason statham shines with his ott tales of masculine toughness and courage immediately followed by some blunder and their arguments are the funniest in particular the one in the casino,comedy
i was looking forward so very much to this movieit sounded from the reviews that it would really be funny  witty and since it was my birthdaymy family and i decided to attend a vip cineplex theater in toronto where you are served food at your seat if you desire the theater was greatthe food was deliciousbut the movie wasin my opinion atrocious  not very funny i loved melissa mccarthys serious role in st vincent in this movie although she played her part wellthe film itself was silly  actually boring the actors played their roles wellbut the scriptincluding bathroom humourstupid dialogueand not being very credible was so mediocre that at one point i actually fell asleepmy grown son kept hoping it would soon be over there have been so many intelligent parodies  witty comedies in the pastsome like it hot from 1959 by billy wilderall the pink panther moviesjohnny english with rowan atkinsonmr beanand the list goes onthe only interesting thing for me was the traveling to the different locations please dont waste a penny on this stupidunfunny slapstickfoulmouthed so called comedy luckily we had free tickets with our scene visa card but it was still a complete waste of time,comedy
i have problems with comedy genre because too often i dont find big hits funny at all  my favorites were always some offthewall left field forgotten camp treasures that no one has ever heard of and im glad to say that for once finally i enjoyed a new cinematic big comedy hit it is hilariouswhere this year we have kingsman the secret service that pokes fun at james bond genre offers different approach  here the main hero who is james bond wannabe is unlikely plump and clumsy melissa mccarthy who is absolutely adorable head over heels in love with secret agent jude law who naturally is not even aware of her when her object of desire disappears in action mccarthy somehow wiggles herself into action and creates mayhem everywhere she turns up  more or less all the comedy is about poking fun at her being such unwitting heroine of action but instead of cruel jokes we are actually laughing along with her because mccarthy shows unexpected bravery and is bouncing enthusiastically at enemies in the best cinematic tradition she even gets herself a sidekick who is far clumsier than herself excellent miranda hart and there are some brilliant parts by peter serafinowicz  jason statham and fierce spoiled heiress rose byrne i dont remember when was the last time i laughed so much out loud during the movie,comedy
just when i had given up on hollywood ever producing a decent movie againthey surprise me with this gem the negative critics must be devoid of any sense of humour it is extremely well directed with great script and great action the acting is brilliantparticularly from melissa mccarthy the stunts and effects are both brilliant and hilarious the comedy is superb especially in the second half of the movie it has been a long time since i laughed so much at a movie do yourself a favour and go see this movie you will not be disappointed,comedy
good laugh great characters especially melissa and the 3 leading guys were fantastic making fun of male characters in action movies  jude law makes fun of bond jason statham mocks his too fast too furious character and peter serafinowcz is perfect as aldo the italian lover what makes me laugh harder are comments coming from men complaining about the movie being explicit  indeed for a split second you see a penis there but not a single pair of boobs cause you know totally naked women in the movies are perfectly fine but making fun of mens anatomy is wrong right grow up  the movie is fantastic i dont go to the cinema often barely 2 times a year and i dont regret i chose ,comedy
well heres a disappointment after reminding us that half the worlds population was being ignored in mainstream american comedy with bridesmaids and reminding us of the comedy timing of sandra bullock in the heat paul feigs third collaboration with melissa mccarthy is a bit of a dud not terrible but no better than something like say last years lets be copsthe trailer would have us think this is a contrived fishoutofwater farce in which mccarthys character susan cooper is woefully out of her depth and bumbles through her mission to stop a nuke falling into the wrong hands it is contrived but the whole truth is more refreshing  she is actually a very capable whos been unwittingly prevented from progressing by her james bondalike partner bradley fine jude law all susan lacks is confidence and she finds it when staring down the barrel of conniving rayna boyanovs rose byrne gun  even if this confidence is essentially a rerun of her sweary cop from the heatthe eurohopping plot is okay with some fun twists and feig has no issues getting decent performances out of his very fine cast the problem  and its a crippling problem  is the script which relies too heavily on fbombs and unfunny similes and includes too many deadend setups without a punchline it indulges the worst impulses of modern american comedy movies scripted situations but few actual scripted jokes or so it would appear  if they are scripted then gawd elp usthe cast do their best to elevate this rawest of material mccarthy who really deserves better by now is reliable as always but the revelation is jason statham playing himself up as the stupidest agent in the cia  hes the kid in the playground or indeed the adult at the dinner party who always has to oneup someone elses story hes utterly superfluous to the plot but it appears that what may have once been a pointless cameo has been elevated due to the deficiencies around him meanwhile peter serafinowicz has a riot as italian stereotype aldo and he gets the best final punchline of anyonesadly the central pairing of melissa mccarthy and miranda hart never comes alive they never come across as real buddies harts deadpan delivery is unsuited to the madcap nature of the action around her there are flashes of what feig is trying to get at  a kind of french and saunders vs james bond vibe  but the dialogue is too brash and the slapstick too broad to match the elder duos best sketcheshow about the omens for the upcoming ghostbusters reboot well the action is reasonably well choreographed the timing usually lands and the necessity for a pg rating should ensure that resorting to dull crassness is not an option but feigs ability as a screenwriter is evidently questionable his last writing credit was the doomed i am david in 2003 we live in hope  but a little less hope now,comedy
is a gem its a little movie that feels like a james bond and yet it stands on its own sure the humor can be crude and the language can be vulgar but show me a comedy these days that doesnt have swearing in it it is almost a must it seems to see which comedy can out swear the other or vulgarities galore seth rogens meet the neighbors had more vulgar behavior then and yet is almost a classy movie its a spoof on all the james bond flicks but what if 007 this time around is a agent who hasnt left the cia basement in ten yearssusan cooper is the voice in secret agent bradley fines ear and his eye from the sky working as a team its susans intel that makes bradley fine look so good but when bradley is murdered by the daughter of a mad man who had a dirty nuke for sale and hid itonly problem is bradley killed the father before they could find out where the bomb is  and since the daughter announced the names of all active field agents its time to introduce a new agent to the field susan cooper susan has no experience in the field and whatever skills she has are rusty but she is soon on the trail of the bad guys determined to avenge the death of bradley fine when things suddenly dont seem like they are and susan has to rely on people she may not trust to complete the mission including a rogue agent played by jason stratham who is a pure delightis this movie for everyone  no but it was funnier then i thought it would be and i laughed out loud  which to me means the film was a success,comedy
is a movie that starts out good but looses its way in the middle it has got laughs but the weak plot brings the movie down that would be my short summary of im not going to go into more specific plot spoilers but after the first half the story and character decisions stop making any sense it feels like the kind of hollywood script that was rewritten a dozen times until all thats left is pieces from wildly different stories i might have given 6 stars instead of 5 but i personally didnt like the way some characters turned out and some parts of the film felt condescending comedies typically start out with a ridiculous premise but it must remain grounded enough otherwise the story stops feeling real and you stop caring about it which was my experience of it lost all touch with realitysusan cooper was a likable character for me but the problem is she doesnt grow or learn through out the film like in say kingsman she just abruptly turns from a clumsy beginner to a competent agentso after bashing the film i have to say that despite its plot problems it was still very funny and overall i enjoyed my movie experience,comedy
melissa mccarthy always plays the same character a funny self conscience middle aged women but that does not mean that this movie was disappointing it was a spoof of a old james bond movie at the start ie the opening the special equipment made for her to use if she needed but went on to be a funny movie yes  she swears a lot the second half of the movie got a little long and the end was a little disappointing i still enjoyed it and laughed if you are a fan of melissa mccarthy you probably liked the movie dont expect to see a serious movie with her in it the locations were beautiful and suited to story to a tee you dont have to look like a to be one,comedy
it was a big year for movies in 2015 kicking off with the fantastic kingsman in february and then hitting us again at the start of summer with the surprisingly hilarious and simplytitled from director paul feig is basically a big budget spoof of franchises like james bond jason bourne and mission impossible it pulls the inspiration for its gags from the well trodden tropes of the genre feig was responsible for one of my favorite comedies of 2011 bridesmaids and brings along frequent collaborator melissa mccarthy as the unlikely hero in the film mccarthy is susan cooper a cia missionoverseer i dont recall if they actually give her job title but it essentially boils down to her sitting at a computer in some big cia control room giving intel instructions and assistance to her assigned agent in the field her agent happens to be the debonair though not as much as he might believe bradley fine played by jude law when fine is killed on a mission to retrieve the location of a stolen nuclear weapon from the daughter of an international arms dealer cooper volunteers to go into the field to complete the mission seeing as how shes spent her entire career behind a computer theres no chance of being recognized as an agent by the enemy now shell have to face assassins international criminals and the incessant advances of a libidinous italian agent if she wants to get prevent an explosive terrorist attack and avenge the death of her unrequited lovei was surprised at how funny i found im sure it stems primarily from my love for the 007 franchise and the fact that a great many jokes in the film are pokes at that series bradley fine is very much a 007ish character suave and deadly even if his intelligence comes into question within moments of meeting him when he refers to a fine wine as baccarat jude law gets to stretch his comedic chops as the ditzy cool guy of the film but theres enough there to see that he mightve actually made a pretty effective james bond if given the chance aside from laws character the film gets more mileage from the bond films and one of its biggest rises from me during the q sequence when cooper is provided her laughably lame equipment from the cias quartermaster madtv alum michael mcdonald in a great cameo no laser watches or aston martins for cooper nopeshes got to have gear that suits her cover her horribly depressing cover once the film gets going and cooper is dispatched to europe on her mission the 007 jokes peter out and it turns into a rather effective film that just so happens to be played for laughs take out the humor and could almost work as a perhaps somewhat generic secret agent movie i can appreciate how the jokes are built around the story instead of vice versa never goes off on a tangent to deliver some forced punchline instead feig and his cast find the most hilarious ways to make the events and people in the story itself absurdoddly enough mccarthy is the straightwoman to the film reacting to the zaniness going on around her she has a few moments where her usual boisterous self comes through but she mainly generally plays it pretty normal here giving others the job of being strange to the point of cartoonishness and i dig it the best running joke in the film comes in the form of jason statham as rick ford a cia agent who goes rogue when cooper is assigned to the mission instead of himself feig lets statham play off his toughguy persona using his action movie heritage to deliver the joke when ford goes off on a rant about the insane conditions hes encountered and come out on top before immediately stumbling over his own two feet melissa mccarthy is the star of but because she plays it so lowkey her performance as good as it is is drowned out by the ludicrous characters surrounding her still shes the hero and does a great job in the starring role i wouldnt mind seeing a sequel to in the future with cooper now an established agent taking on another mission im afraid to say too much about because i wouldnt want to ruin any of the best bits but rest assured if youre a fan of the genre or the work of paul feig is a pretty safe bet for a fun time,comedy
i started watching this movie and in the beginning i thought oh its not that bad then after she got accepted to become a field agent i had an urge to shoot myself if i wanted to watch a fantasy i would watch lord of the rings or watch the star wars movies but to see an obviously overweight woman be disgusted to sleep with jason statham and gets whistled at for wearing a new dress then when i saw that she learned to fly a jet in 15 seconds and she memorized a map of italy that she never looked at made me go crazy the plot twist was great even though it technically was not a twist what so ever the character build up was smooth except they forgot to show us where mrs cooper got her superhuman abilities the ending made me want to personally punch the director in the gut,comedy
i was not a fan of melissa mccarthyuntil this movieif you support some jokes and silly speeches earlier in the film youll see right away that this is a spectacular comedy that mocks movies and action moviesmccarthy is probably made perfect in a role tailored for herstatham is hilarious mocking their own old characters from crazed wayi do not understand why so many people have made such harsh criticism this moviecriticize profanity sexism the fact that the main character being fat and this is the main joke of the movie  as if none of this existed in other films like newthis film is a triumph for the excellent performances by the well interconnected dialogue the jokes that move between the funny and the bizarre in a few secondsi highly recommend this movie had long since i laughed so much and for 2 hours straight,comedy
written and directed by paul feigstarring melissa mccarthy jason statham jude law rose byrne miranda hart allison janney and bobby cannavale her roles always root for the underdog and i felt it is always leading towards a major movie where she is the star that laughs at everyone else in gilmore girls identity thief the heat snl etc she always spins the negative attitude towards peoples opinions in she does just that on a grander scale this is not a revenge of the nerds type of movie this movie shows that what you make out people to be is only your vague opinion in melissas character is seen as unable to go on a mission just because her weight and that is an awful stereotype the time has finally come where melissa mccarthy showed those people a taste of their own medicine yet in her kind way this movie is humble and points out everyones flaws and that makes it all more honest therefore all the more funny honestly if issues like this are not discussed people will not get better this movie presents a powerful message of peace and love it is about how no one should hold grudges because words and opinions are all silly and should not be taken seriously or to heart this movie starts off with a bang jude law as bradley fine a james bond character and susan cooper melissa mccarthy guiding him on a computer that sees heat waves of people in his location to guide him then someone points out that the rodents that are bats in the office pooped on susans cake that she made for someones birthday only to distract her with her loud normal office complaints in an odd situation where they are spies and agents susans friend and coworker nancy b artingstall miranda hart constant excitement over the whole issue makes this movie all the more real and fun a spoof with a purpose that purpose is to change peoples perspectives of stereotypes while laughing at those stereotypes at the same time showcases an honest portrayal of everyone how susan is awkward clumsy insecure shy and reserved at first particularly when she went on a friendly outing as a thank you for saving his life with fine then he gives her a cake necklace unknowing how insensitive that is she lets it slide and then tomorrow will be another day at the office then later on in the movie as susan was guiding fine there were technical issues and she could not help him and suggested it might be too easy and that he should back away yet he did not so she witnessed his murder or so she thought then the woman in video rayna boyanov rose byrne who shot him later stated all the agents names as warning of their fate that amplified susans emotions and made her want to go out in the field to make that woman pay for what she did to her crush so susan goes to a meeting after fines memorial service in that meeting there is one of the agents that is still living rick ford jason statham as a not so bright aggressive macho character susans boss elaine crocker allison janey informs them all about the video and how he cannot go to help so rick mentions the movie faceoff which elaine points out is not a real thing and he states how two american guys claimed that it is a real thing this is a nice spin of stereotyping people for example athletic guys are seen as less intelligent and how americans are seen as less intelligent or refined this movie is payback for all british people can do amazing comedy lots of when elaine said they needed someone invisible susan jumped to the chance because that is how she feels and how she really is elaine reluctantly agrees only to discover a decade old video of susans training where she was surprisingly good and aggressive unlike her looks as elaine even stated how she comes across around the office as tame and unable to hold a gun then elaine asked why and susans answer is fine suggested it and that it is better for the team and elaine said he sniped you women rolls her eyes and moves her chair the other way that shows how many times elaine has seen this and is bothered by this this is meticulous directing as well as a script the actors are an amazing cast that scene shows how strong women who dont let men put them down become the boss and how women like susan remain in the background despite their intelligence and amazing capabilities susan suddenly becoming the warrior that she is and dresses the way she dresses refusing to play these geeky undercover roles they give her then refusing to stay in the sidelines just track and report she knew as her friend nancy told her she plays it safe melissas real life husbands cameo as an annoying tourist asking a silly question at a bad time is an issue that happens however in her case shes trying to chase the bad guys that was a clever joke the film is clever and concise particularly with the snappy dialogue this movie deserves a 455 if not a 9510 because some parts were far fetched like the office bat issue and ricks character falling unconscious for no reason these parts were not needed the movie can be subtle and still funny enough it does not need to rely on cheap antics to get a laugh funny movie would recommend it,comedy
director paul feig and actress melissa mccarthy continue to make magic together their third collaboration is definitely more enjoyable than the heat and in many ways measures up to bridesmaidsmccarthy owns this film feig actually wrote it too unlike the previous two films but its clear he did so knowing mccarthy would take it over shes dynamic sassy lovable and foul and its delightful to watch even if its messytitle alone tells you that is meant to be a riff on classic films specifically the james bond series but its not a parody rather feig plays with conventions especially as they relate to women and even pokes at what other directors writers and producers might do if given the same premise of a cia desk jockey launched into the field to stop a scheme involving a nuclear warheadin fact the deception goes beyond the appearances and into the plot somehow feig keeps the story fresh and intriguing even when the film descends into goofy preposterous chaos its impressive how good of a tightrope act it manages between stupidity and sharp effective humormccarthy toes that line too at times shes just a vehicle for improvised shenanigans and at others theres something genuine in her character susan cooper its hard to pin down the characters qualities when shes constantly changing appearances and even personalities but never for a moment does it seem like shes trying to hard and failingwe do get to watch jason statham try the same thing however and make a total ass of himself the star of actual movies does have some funny dialogue at times but his character is a screwup who talks a mean game this idiocy is part of the conventiontwisting in but there are times he just seems like an idiot its more fun to watch peter serafinowicz as the outrageously lewd aldo  an italian agent who susan encounters in the field at various points in the film  than watch statham flounder jude law even does a nice job though his character isnt called upon for muchrose byrne as rayna boyanov the films antagonist  a role she seems to excel in when acting for feig continues to nail her comic bits with such incredible poise shes both a bonafide villain and a funny caricature of one rayna isnt hollow which would render byrne unfunny shes multidimensional enough to really work off of mccarthys susan feels like a multibout boxing match between a stupid genre spoof comedy and a professionally improvised fresh twist on a stupid genre spoof comedy every time you prepare to role your eyes and deem it a joke of a film it comes up with something hysterically clever to pull you back in not many films or filmmakers can do it and thats what makes the feigmccarthy duo one to keep an eye on for the long termsteven cthanks for reading visit movie muse reviews for more,comedy
i waste my time to watch this bad movie i only watch this because of jason jason and jude they underrated yourself acting in this movie and to spend 65m to make this bad movie with poor comedy is absurdlybad move for jasons career maybe you dont know what to do whit all that money you have but this is very bad way to spend on project like this and i must to say rating of 72 very good for this movie its overratedalso i want to say something to american directors i begging you to save us of comedys like this and movies like this even james bond is a bad movie uk queen toy,comedy
seems that the majority of all the prim and propers in the world have seen this movie and didnt like itso what if its clichd and has loads of swearing in it its just funny as hell ive not laughed so hard all yeari watched this with no real knowledge of the story line or fluff which you pick up with advertising and thoroughly enjoyed it films like this arent made to provide intelligent dialogue but for shts and giggles which are plenty in the moviestathams character is just one big dig at his normal run of the mill movie characters and is a constant menace in the film whilst being a bit tasty with what he does he still manages to do it badly and you get to see him with hair on his head too which is novel the very last scene after the clips is funny as sin too so keep watching,comedy
normally this isnt my type of movie but is well above average for its type because i liked the lead character she was funny but it left me thinking if only if only theyd have been more bold this could have been a great movie if they wouldnt have been afraid to go allout and use her to her fullest ability yes more fat jokes they could have made an absolutely hilarious movie instead they played it safe and did a lot of different types of jokes for standard cheap laughs when they utilized their main cashcow no pun intended it was very funny but everything else was standardthis could have been a great movie they could have kept the plot the samebut they should have added about 10 more fat jokes they had a few subtle jokes about looks and weightbut to be really funny they should have added about 10 bold jokes like i said im not one for slapstickbut for a movie like this you have to do it big dont be afraid like instead of making lame jokes about random stupid things simply have a few chairs explode when she sits on them instead of her hanging onto a helicopter have her pull the dang thing down with her weight instead of using karate have her squash people stuff like that that would have improved this movie from 510 to at least 710 or even 810 dont get me wrong there were some decent jokes with her the subtle jokes were still funny i liked the lead ladybut utilize her more,comedy
i love melissa mccarthy let me start off by saying thatbut lets not make her out to be lucille balllucy had a sophistication and class and was still able to get laughs without having to play blue resort to perverted jokes or foul language in fact lucy is still making people laugh it doesnt matter how old you are or how long ago lucy was on the air you tend to like lucy if you have a sense of humornot so with mccarthy i like to think i have a great sense of humor and while i like mike and molly i tend to not like her movies i find her much more funny in mike and molly where she has to be more reeled in because of the fcc standards on network televisionthis movie was one or two big laughs mixed with a few smaller chuckles among a bunch of  seriously moments some of the attempts at laughs were unnecessary like the big penis selfie it was not only not funny it added nothing to the moment and was there for the cheap and quite forced laugh the audience when i saw the movie seemed uncomfortable and werent quite sure if they were suppose to laugh or not when you fall to cheap laughs  its because the writingacting isnt strong enough on its ownand you know you may be dropping the fbomb too often when you have 50 cent doing a cameo and hes the only one with a clean mouth you also know the movie is in trouble when side characters who pop in and out on occasion to drop a joke like the ones played by statham and law are funnier than the leading character i actually anticipated the moments statham would appear i also enjoyed laws characterid say its funny enough to see  but you will not want to own this one on dvd or really feel like seeing it again say for example you have a friend who hasnt seen it and wants you to come along youll probably politely decline and say saw it already once was enough i give it a ccif theyd have dropped a few more jokes instead of fbombs i think it could easily have been a better movie but they were pushing blue too many times for a cheap laughi really really really wanted to like it more than i did but alas the funniest scenes were in the commercials,comedy
my wife and i could not even finish this movie it was so bad we thought statham who she loves might make for a good time instead were watching utterly outrageous unfunny nonsense where every man is a bumbling fool or dead and this obviously outofshape morbidly obese woman is flipping around like a ninja its so obviously a normalsized athletic person in a fat suit its not even funny the attempts at witty quips and jokes are literally painful to watch and hear there is more cringe in this movie than youd find at a my littly pony conventioni dare you to try to make it through the whole thing no i take that back  i wouldnt wish that on anyone,comedy
i read some of the reviews posted here both before and after watching the movie and tend to come down more on the side of the negatives than the positives i saw melissa mccarthy in her two previous films and quite liked her ive seen miranda hart on english tv and quite like her too so i figured what the hey lets give it a whirl for reasons not explained in the script miranda hart retains her english accent despite working for the cia in the us at times i got the impression she was allowed to write her own dialogue as well for theres more than a trace of her quirky style in evidence in terms of chemistry however m and m are about as tight as oil and water im certainly not against james bond type spoofs but derek flint james coburn and matt helm dean martin have already been there done that and got the tee shirts not exactly a waste of two hours but neither a eureka moment,comedy
it seems from the imdb score that a lot of people have a much higher opinion of this movie than myself melissa mccarthy plays susan cooper who is an office cia agent helping field agent bradley fine jude law having vowed to never watch a jason statham movie this is the second time recently that ive been shocked to see his name pop up on the opening credits i suppose its fair to say that he does play a very particular type of character and if you like that then you will not have the same reservationsas for the film itself it does have its moments but falls somewhere between austin powers and james bond not as funny as austin powers and not as entertaining as james bond anyway judge for yourself as its clear that many people enjoyed the movie,comedy
is a blandly forgettable name for a film but in their third outing together director paul fieg and his muse melissa mccarthy strike comedy gold yet again mccarthy plays susan cooper a cia analyst who works behind a desk partnering with a smooth talking debonair field agent who goes by the aptronym bradley fine jude law unexpectedly hilarious cooper nurtures a massive crush on fine who seems completely oblivious to the point where when he is murdered she offers to go into the field herself to try and avenge his death of course all sorts of complications spring up but despite having spent most of her years as a desk jockey cooper proves herself to be preternaturally adept at the game and her quick wits confidence and brusque attitude always are on hand to help her save the day the script is pretty solid delivering up enough twists and turns to keep things interesting but the real treat of the movie are in the performances by now everyone knows that mccarthy is an oscar nominated comedienne but i could not have predicted such hilarious performances out of jude law or jason statham who absolutely kills it as one of the cias ultra serious field agents who is completely over the top but cant see the humour in his own ridiculousness also great allison janney in a small role as the head of the cia british comedienne miranda hart as susans bestie and rose byrne as a bratty villain,comedy
im asian i watched a lot of englishamerican movie so im getting used to every joke they make and they did really make me laugh a lot for every punchline i dont know why some of the reviewer keep talking about feminist thing but this is just a fiction aint i right its just a movie for us to have some fun and i really do have a lot of fun and good time melissa mccarthy did a very good job depicting an out of all place woman who just become a field agent and never forget the hilarious jason statham he is so funny and i dont know if this is the first time he is actually acting rather than just become a mechanic transporter and anything else because he did a really good job miranda hart rose byrne peter serafinowicz and like every character in this story are so funny and paul feig you are genius nice action and twist the funniest action movie ever so far,comedy
saw too many 1 star review which honestly is not fair yes this isnt as great as some other comedy out there may be not even as good as bridesmaid which seemingly is the benchmark now but this isnt another sisterhood movie this is a funny spin on a flick shot people personally dont mind it and yes could it be better oh for sure as a comedy there are still a lot of blanks for humor in but at times when it happens i feel the make up for it not all humor had work for sure too but i feel there is enough balance to not make things too over the top and the ones that worked just did perfectly plus there is a lot to be loved about the movie beautiful scenery  people  outfit  cars  planes awesome cast when you think about it overall funny story line and scenes it seems it is a movie that while the plot doesnt take it as seriously but still put in the effort for a good movie,comedy
this movie is based on a nice comical idea  in a james bondesque world of supermen and supermolls a chubby middleaged underling has to mingle in unfortunately the fun stopped at the idea and never translated into a proper script with witty dialogues for large parts of the movie we see melissa mccarthy as efficient deskworker susan cooper bumbling alongside the evil dreamboats jude law cia superagent bradley fine and rose byrne as sexy supervillain rayna boyanov for example there is one trustbuilding scene in which rayna tells susan that she reminds her of her mother which susan fails to take as a compliment that scene drags on for what feels like 10 minutes with rayna describing her mother in increasingly grotesque ways its like one of those jokes among colleagues that take a terribly wrong turn where noone wants to lose face and simply end itto really mess up the comedy the producers decided to pull a kevin james on us and try to make us believe that at least for a fleeting moment susan is not just a nice but average person but that she really is on a par with her supercilious competitors that the reason why she didnt cut it as a superagent is discrimination and a lack of selfconfidence that there is a snowballs chance in hell that jude law is sexually attracted to her simply because she is such a good chum jude laws flirtations with her are shown not as friendly but inconsequential but as deceitful weve seen this makebelieve plot a hundred times before with an average guy being chased by perfect 10women this time its the other way around but it doesnt make it any betterbridesmaids was crass and super funny but theres nothing left of that in paul feigs latest offering ultimately its maybe 10 minutes of fun and entertainment in a 90minute movie,comedy
my favourite person over the last decade has been the late christopher hitchens  divisive  polemical and explosively controversial he was best known for taking on the men of god and constantly winning in his own take no prisoners style  one almost forgotten polemic is his vanity fair rebuttal that women are not funny  suffice to say i didnt disagree with this opinion and do recall getting in to something of a heated internet debate on this  no hard feelings on my part because its just the internet and isnt all that important but i still stand by with what i said in that i dont find women funny and does absolutely nothing to change my mind and that hitchens is right its interesting that much of the marketing material in britain has made a big deal about starring well known names of statham  law and byrne  a clever marketing ploy because melissa mccarthy will be treated with blank expressions and mutterings of who    after seeing all i can say is her relative obscurity this side of the atlantic is well deserved and hope it continues for a lifetime  ms mccarthy is chubby  unattractive and uses her as a star vehicle to deconstruct the james bond franchise and all those other espionage thrillers  she also constantly puts her metaphorical foot in it  swears a lot and is probably even more unfunny than the other 35 billion woman walking on the face of planet earth today  that is really saying something believe methis is a pity because as a spoof sp works relatively well  i saw the straight laced  po faced survivor last week and truth be told i probably had more fun watching than i did watching that  the espionage element is fairly well done  tough you have to suspend disbelief that a cutie played by byrne would be in league with the murderous misogynists of al qaeda but youre not supposed to take things seriously here  and jude law and jason statham have a whale of a time sending themselves up  a fact that theyre able to communicate to the audience and i wonder if this has everything to do with being popular with critics  regardless of this suffers from being a comedy vehicle for someone who simply is not funny,comedy
i loved this movie a friend recommended it and laughed the entire way through i have since then passed the love on every time i watch it i catch little hilarious nuances i missed by probably laughing too hard i highly recommend this movie just do yourself a favor watch it without any expectations and see it for what it is hilariousmelissa mccarthy really demonstrates that she can handle the starring role and brings the comedy jude law plays a on par with bond but with humorous parody jason statham is so unexpectedly funny its refreshing and delightful i cant wait to see him in another comedy peter serafinowicz from shaun of the dead plays aldo who is an italian she ends up working with made me laugh constantly i dont want to give away anything so i cant say much morena baccarin firefly and stargate sg1 has a small but fun part shes always fun to watchdont look for a deep philosophical or high brow comedy its funny and uncomplicated enjoyable,comedy
just when i was ready to give up on melissa mccarthy for running her shtick into the ground she surprises me this gem of a comedy melissa mccarthy stars as susan cooper a single woman who works behind a desk for the cia when the identities of all active agents are compromised she enters the field to track down an arms dealer looking to sell a nuclear bomb movies dont really rank high among my favorite genres although daniel craig as bond is definitely changing that but this s main selling point among many is that it knows how silly it is and just plays along if one were to critique on its plot of course one would conclude that its convoluted and nonsensical however the comedic writing and performances are all topnotch here making considerations of plot almost irrelevant my main issue with mccarthy before was her excessively profane loud and obnoxious screen persona thankfully she tones it down a lot here and goes for a more subtle approach her character does kind of become more outre as the film progresses but it was organic to the central theme of a woman coming into her own in a maledominated profession in terms of exploring that rose byrne neighbors plays very well opposite mccarthy as the arms dealer that cooper is after even though theyre on opposite sides of the law they share a bond over being taking seriously as professionals in their respective fields so to speak there was even great comic work from noncomic actors like jude law and jason statham who is essentially parodying his action star roles it was overthetop but oh so funny i also liked alison janney as susan coopers cia boss outside of the writing and acting all of the technical bits were welldone if unspectacular and the action was wellchoreographed there were a few moments where the cgi didnt look so great but the cheesy nature of the effects kind of fit with the overblown satirical comedy that film was going for finally there was some pacing issues towards the end of the second act and the beginning of the third maybe 510 minutes could have trimmed but i was laughing so much i barely noticed overall is perhaps the second best comedy ive seen this year behind kingsman it was able to take a comedian who i was beginning to tire of and make her funny again it also was just plain hilarious the whole way through and definitely worth your timemoney,comedy
the sooner someone stops paul feig from making films the better if we get rid of him we get rid of mccarthy as well now isnt that the kind of world were all striving to live in,comedy
i know melissa mccarthy since gilmore girls but never thought she would rise this far especially to dominate in a movie with the presence of the big names around her that too in an action film equivalent to top quality shes one of my favourite actresses even i enjoyed thoroughly her underappreciated tammy so this is where the action stars become comedians and comedians action stars indeed it worked out so wellit shames comedyflicks like the pink panther johnny english etc from the director of the heat helmed another perfect female oriented comedy jude law was a decent as usual but jason statham was unbelievably awesome in his tiny part i had plenty of good laughs the loud ones after a long time i still remember the unicorn joke and i cant stop laughing and roof over a bike gadgets and so on i find melissa mccarthys line deliverance are so funny and i enjoy her films specially for that reasoni know they used a stunt double and bluegreen screens in the crucial segments for a better result but still she excelled in all stunt sequences that required physically herself in front of the camera one of the trivia says after the end of each day shooting she looked like fell down an elevator shaft her hard work definitely paid off very wellthere are lots of adult oriented comedy so strictly it is for grownups only and may be matured teens ill be definitely disappointed if they wont make a sequel for this if they do i hope they retain all the cast especially statham along the lead actress and finally im looking forward the directoractresss the third collaboration ghostbusters710,comedy
review by mike smith a deskbound cia analyst volunteers to go undercover to infiltrate the world of a deadly arms dealer and prevent diabolical global disasterjude law jason statham and    melissa mccarthy from the looks of this movie it was going to be a agonizing flop but to my surprise this movie was fun and i cannot stop recommending itthe cast is an unlikely grouping but they all work awesome together after the last couple of melissa mccarthy films ive seen i was not looking forward to this one but she did a really good job if felt like she toned down the bumbling kevin jamesness unlike she has done in the past yes its still there from time to time but not overdone the one person i loved in this film is jason statham this is a different roll for him he is really funny and i feel like some of the stories he tells are things that happened in jason stathams other filmsthe story is good but not really original and the film is forgettable although has a great mix of comedy and action the laughs are strong and are non stop i was shocked by how good melissa mccarthy did with fight sceneswith a fun story good laughs fun action and jason statham like you have never seen him before is a good watch and you shouldnt let this movie pass you by cheers and remember life wont suck as long as there is a good movie to watch85 out of 10 edited by samantha locke twitter fatmiketpkfacebook page facebookcomfatmikesmoviereviews,comedy
this movie was absolutely one of the most funniest movies i have ever seen i mean the jokes were hilarious the characters were hilarious and the fighting scenes were hilarioussurprisingly jason statham was the funniest character in the whole movie with melissa mccarthy being right behind him statham said some stuff that would just make you crack up and give you tears like i said mccarthy was right there with him as her jokes were just laugh out loud funny rose byrne miranda hart and peter serafinowicz were also quite funnyanother thing that made you crack up were some of the fight scenes mainly the ones with mccarthy the stunts and moves they did on people gave you a laughand a lot of the jokes were just absolutely hysterical they are so clever that you cannot stop laughing after you hear it and you wonder how paul feig came up with such a jokefeig did an outstanding job with directing and writing along with the great performances from statham and mccarthy go see this movie if you love for your cheeks to be sore and have tears in your eyes from laughing,comedy
i dont understand all the bashers many of them claim that the movie is lame and stupid i agree the movie isnt deep it doesnt make a person think hard the plot isnt dark or complex and there isnt much character development but thats not what kind of movie is it is a james bond spoof thats all and it succeeds in this very well my wife and i laughed hysterically throughout the entire movie we watched it in the theater last year just watched it for the second time last night and loved it both times we are melissa mccarthy fans shes living proof that you dont have to be stick skinny to be successful and i think thats pretty cool we also liked her in the heat although we liked this movie more and we watch mike and molly every weekim taking away one star for the cussing as others have said i think they overused it and they really overused it in the heat im not a prude but it does get irritating after a while and i believe the writers could have omitted quite a bit of it and the movie would have been better especially toward the end of the film so if you want a lighthearted relaxing movie and dont expect something earthshattering give this one a try i think youll find it fun,comedy
frankly i gave it an 8 because i thought the 7 rating given by the users at large is accurate  not bad but not high art either spoiler alertthe movie is basically a satire of other films especially the earlier sean conneryroger moore james bond era the film involves the search for a miniature atomic device which was a lift from thunderball and never say never again for example the movie also seems to take inspiration from an old tv series called search in that the mccarthy character seems to have a photographic memory and is linked to a headquarters by wearable sensors melissa mccarthy  yes she is heavy  but she represents an anti hero  someone who we think is incapable of doing what she does because of her weight i realize that most people do not think she is capable of doing these things but remember she does do her own stunts which are quite physical the film uses a lot of swearing  frankly swearing is absent from james bond  and the characters are somewhat more realistic because of itstill  it has a lot of action and is pretty tense at times its enjoyable to be sure,comedy
2015hilarious drop dead funny start to finish this is a madcap takeoff off the standard movie complete with portable nuclear bomb gadgets that do amazing things handtohand combat and a motor scooter prepare thyself the movie opens with jude law as a slim bondtype in a hot situation and then there is the sneeze but this isnt a bond spoof its not jude law but melissa mccarthy who runs the film and she has comic timing and that underdog toughness with a firecracker behind every comeback to make this film pop at every turn if you arent laughing at her face or her wisecracks youll be laughing at the situation and the plot that never stops giving its all nonsense of course thats the point this is in the vein of the airplane and austin powers kind of comedy where a situation is created that allows for all kinds of absurdity its a gold mine characters get to say things we all wish we could say word play is a big part of it so keep your ear tuned and the supporting cast goes with the implausible flow especially the evil woman rose byrne and a couple of mccarthy sidekicks jason stathamwho is director paul feig a television director and an actor who went to my high school who made his true breakthrough recently with a string of three melissa mccarthy films including this one they have hit a stride that you need to see to appreciate and they both know itworth seeing and worth seeing twice,comedy
it is truly surprising to me how many positive reviews this film has accumulated this movie is as bad as an adam sandler movie and it has the exact same type of humour this movie is not funny not at all i mean seriously a fight scene where two people are vomiting on each other is supposed to be funny does paul feig think his audience is in grade school how this film is getting positive reviews is beyond me there is not a single clever line not one funny joke that justifies a positive response i think i laughed once at the very beginning but it was more of a snort as what had happened was more surprising than funny i seriously want to know why this film gets a pass at being juvenile and unfunny and why adam sandler movies get crapped on for doing the exact same thing im not defending mr sandler either his movies are plenty atrociousbut at least everyone knows it and the people who go and see and dislike his movies have no excuse this film there are excuses people are actually praising this trash and calling it original what how is that possible someones getting paid off by paul feig again,comedy
i ever had any intention of watching this film but decided to after my oldest daughter convinced me to give it a try after all melissa mccarthy has made a few films that just irritated me and i was not in the mood for more of the same fortunately while the film is far from perfect it surprised me and mccarthy didnt play just another buffoonwhen the film begins a super agent for the cia jude law is in the middle of an important mission while his assistant susan mccarthy stays back at the base as usual watching and assisting him hes somehow hooked up to some sort of closed circuit television and much of the success of his missions seems to be the result of susans very quick thinking however this one does not go well and the agency is soon having a funeral for the guyand the nuclear weapon they were trying to recover is still out there and the woman who has it seems more than willing to sell it to the highest bidder however they cant just send in agents to get her and the weapon as the vicious lady with the bomb knows the identities of all of the field agentsso they need someone unknown to find her and since susan is unknown outside the cia she might just be able to do the missionthough the folks at the agency certainly have their doubtsin many ways i liked this film much of it was because of susan she was not a typical character sure she had a few dopey moments but mccarthy was not playing yet another stereotypical fat broad instead she was often extremely clever resourceful and even dare i say macho i actually would mind seeing a sequel with this inexperienced but competent agent i also liked some of the charactersparticularly susans assistant as well as the crazy bald agent and the italian guy see the film and youll see what i mean unfortunately the film did have a few problems too often while generally a very intelligent film it also too often took the low road with ample jokes about feces hemorrhoids vomit and incredibly crude language with less of this and more of the super agent stuff youd have had a much better filmthough on balance its still well worth your time,comedy
the main point is for the movie to make you laugh the plot maybe as what youd expect but it is really funny my family and i had a good laugh and we liked it although i wont probably go out of my way to see it again id recommend it to anyone whod appreciate a good laugh if you havent seen it give it a chance and watch it then decide for yourself if i have just believed every bad review about the movie i would have not found out how funny it was its really not how the actress humiliated herself by choosing to play this character nor how redundant comedy movies are its about how much the movie entertained you and made you laugh its not that complicated and viewers are not being asked to evaluate a sophisticated art its supposed to make you laugh and thats what it did kudos,comedy
is the kind of film that youd recommend to anyone who likes to laugh its a terrific actioncomedy that is high on energy humour  entertainment i dont remember laughing so hard in a film in such a long time as much as i did while watching synopsis a deskbound cia analyst volunteers to go undercover to infiltrate the world of a deadly arms dealer and prevent diabolical global disasteroozing james bondpink panther fanaticism is a thoroughly enjoyable joyride that delivers even more than whats expected from it writerdirector paul feig is in topform his screenplay is packed with superbly done jokes  the narrative moves at a brisk pace a special mention for the undeniably crude yet funny dialogue his direction on the otherhand is excellent cinematography is lavish editing is razorsharp art  costume design are flawless actionsequences are impressively executed as well performancewise melissa mccarthy is extraordinary the supremely talented actress delivers a superior comedic performance that definitely ranks amongst her best to date rose byrne is topnotch her comic timing is simply fantastic jason statham sportingly spoofs himself  brings the house down on numerous occasions jude law is efficient in a cameo miranda hart is outstanding she stands out bobby cannavale is decent allison janney shines as always nargis fakhri is winsome in her bit on the whole is flat out hilarious the comedy of the summer,comedy
first of all it is a copy of many moviesbe it the style be it the music and be it the acting and the heroine mannerismit is just a time pass if you have nothing else to do a fat lady in bond suit is the best you will get in this movie with jude law almost a guest artist the story is simple and not mentioning telling as all can guess gadgets were old and villains are dumb only the acting of the lead role is worth mentioning just chew your pop corn and let the movie endhowever it will not endit will drag you from country to country from budapest to rome and so onactions are clumsy and thats why i am forced to give a rating not more than 5,comedy
this film was so amazing melissa mccarthy is one of my favourite actresses and this film is really funny i couldnt stop laughing throughout the film it gives you more to laugh at and it doesnt stop there even though some scenes are meant to be serious like solving an issue its tremendously funny by the way they do it and the fact that this is jason stathams first comedy film i have to say he was absolutely brilliantly funny i have never seen miranda hart acting so bizarre and strange it was that funny i have fallen in love with this movie and i would 100 recommend it if you needed a laugh i have to rate this movie 10 out of 10,comedy
i watched this movie during the first couple of hours on a flight over the atlantic  despite the loud flight engine and constant interruptions from the message system i laughed hard and had tears runningthe movie makes fun of all the established movies where the hero have to be perfect handsomebeautiful slim fast know everything have perfect mannersand it start with this  a perfect male make the intro but soon the main actor melissa mccarthy play this short overweighted infatuated shy rude who do all wrong and right at the same timethere are so many unexpected scenes that takes you by surprise contrary to other movies you are not prepared and you just have to laugh as it get funny and hilariouswarning if you are put off by rude language you might not like it it is not all over the movie but in some scenes the use of the rude language is partly a cover for the but also our main actors personality when she is cornered  like a small dog barking ,comedy
i watched this movie in the cinema last week with my brother and cousin i have to admit it i didnt expect much from the movie but im very glad that i saw the movie anyway i liked this movie i didnt expect it to be that good but it surprised me with melissa mccarthy as the main character the movie didnt disappoint me a bit she can always make me laugh the movie has an awesome twist just when you think its over  its not great actorsactresses also funny movie to watch and lets not forget about jude law god damn hes fine overall give it a try i dont regret watching it and id sure not regretted that ive paid to watch this movie ,comedy
this is an amazing movie it is almost perfect for any situation almost any way if you are a big melissa mccarthy fan you will not be disappointedi think this is a excellent combination of actors character and different moodsmelissa mccarthy is a brilliant actress and it shows how fun she thinks it is to film movies and in this case she has done it again there is a sense of passion and sense of humor in this moviefor the people who love too laugh with their friends and family i really recorded this movie it will for sure bring your mood up,comedy
i love melissa mccarthy  rose byrne so my expectations were already very high for this movie the cinema was full with people excited to see and it was a great environment overall this is honestly the only movie ive ever watched who had me laughing from start to finish nonstop all the jokes were hilarious melissas delivery was on point with every character she played and rose byrne as the villain was just perfect youd think im a little biased as i love these women so much but it was amazing to see the whole room laughing so loud at each joke we had people crying from laughter throughout the whole movie and it was just an amazing experience overall felt like an incredible therapy session id advise everyone to see this movie in groups it is an amazing experience to share with other people as it also provides a lot of content for inside jokes so happy with how the movie turned out and i hope theres a lot of movies like this one coming out soonno exaggeration from my side funniest movie ive ever watched,comedy
please please ignore all negative reviews or anything rated 1 this is one of melissa mccarthys best work as she make us laugh out loud even harder than her other films the film has a brilliant cast as it includes rose byrn jason statham and miranda hart in which all actorsactresses portray a role in which is very unique for them and yet they can still amaze us with their humour and amazing skills there are jokes after jokes after jokes that leave you lying on the floor laughing some of the funniest scenes are when melissa mccarthys character is given a secret identity that she truly hates and refers to herself as looking like somebodys homophobic aunt and so many more running jokes play out through the movie and they get funnier and funnier so i highly recommend this film as its a true masterpiece,comedy
a really great movie action  comedy and some scenes will make you laugh so hard  it is more comedy for me than actionthe movie did a great job on entertaining the audience and it makes it a fun movie i really like jason statham character in this movie he is really funny  i will not write any spoilers or scenesjason statham he did a great job i really like this actorif you had a bad day and you want to laugh i recommend to watch this moviethis is my opinion about the movie thanks for reading my review,comedy
we were expecting another raunchy average spoof but it was so much more im compelled to sit down at the computer and give it high marks the melissa mccarthy character is likable relatable and unknowingly funny the script takes stereotypes such as arrogant hot shot secret agents mysterious beauties lonely cat lady and mousy secretary and displays them all for us to see in a most hilarious light its refreshing in that it comments on the inner strength within us  as shown by the insecure eager to please character susan cooper each performer is compelling susans tootall side kick and best friend is a perfect matchthey remain vulnerable and smart as they bumble their way through social scenes and finesse their way to success the best aspect of this film though is the nonstop laughs i want to watch it again,comedy
when melissa mccarthy is involved in a movie you already now its going to be a good one  and has pair it never failed to do that  its such an hilarious movie to see  basically a sweet love story about the extreme lengths you would go to for the person you love and in this case and undercover but not any ordinary  jason statham was absolute belly ache he had me in fits he played his part so well an undercover with the extra added storys that he has done  bit of a jackanory 1010 from him  then we have miranda hart she basically plays herself the classic miranda shes just pure comedy as it is but when 50cent is involved and being tackled to the ground by her its not to be missed  jude law as well wow he looked great such a charmer  he played the bond agent who susan aka melissa was inlove with  just a really enjoyable movie to watch you wont be disappointed by it  melissa mccarthy is a full on legend  if you havent already seen it or even if you have watch it again ,comedy
not too many actioncomedy movies can pull off both its genres requirements easily and it will be a lot harder to maintain proportions between the conflicting elements and still able to come out with something thats both fun and crazy but a deliriously hilarious comedy and an exhilarating action extravaganza is a standout exceptionsusan cooper melissa mccarthy doesnt strike as someone fit for a field agent work shes fortysomething and fat she might prefer the term bbw and shes stuck behind a desk at a basement in a cia headquarters for many people she may seem nothing but for special agent brad fine jude lawwhom she works for as his eyes and ears using every possible technological marvels to relay realtime informationshes a fatal weapon being stuck on that job works fine for her but when fine suddenly gets assassinated she volunteers to be sent to the field so she could avenge her partners deathmay come across as a kingsman the secret service reminiscence it teems with brutal action and bloody stunt demonstrations but presents an even more nearfatal doses of comedy that would surely send you to the edge of your seat while laughing your ass off melissa mccarthy proves to be the strongest asset of this movie coming out as fully capable of carrying out the demands of her role her transition from a timid analyst to an aggressive and cunning secret agent is fast and seamless but once shes on duty she becomes something impeccably ready for deadly action however it wouldnt feel right to dismiss the efforts of her equally capable costars jason statham is a delight to see as the irritable and churlish agent rick ford he possesses an irresistible charm here pulling him out of the shadow of the totally opposite vengeful character he played in furious 7 miranda hart as nancy who takes susans role when susan takes fines provides unmissable comic efforts while rose byrne rayna boyanov and an equally dangerous bunch of villains are on the other side to make the level of threat at a steady high level jude law has a shorter exposure as field agent but his deadly verve and intellect reminiscent of james bond is enough to leave a lasting impact his early demise would actually be the one thing to propel our heroine susan into action these actors prove the juggle of action and comedy an easy task making their spotless effectivity transcend past its somewhat flawed storyline the narrative tracks a deteriorating trajectory but its easy to drown this flaw out once the excitement and deafening laughter dominate theres a plenty of humorous displays even at moments when death is uttering hello at the scene both mccarthy and statham are both stand outs delivering these efforts and so is law being able to toss up themselves into the claws of danger while still able to make fun of their incredibly gruesome situations this proves the film of having an outstanding grip of its elements managing to keep the proportion between the action and comedy acceptable the incredibly wellchoreographed fight scenes and exquisitely captured settings add up to the level of greatness that this film has to make it arrive into something never less than satisfying theres no telling whether the showcase of fun and action is going to end  nor theres any hint of it slowing down at any moment its insane i mean with all those surprising twists and turns you wouldnt expect its beautifully insane in the end regardless of its narrative shortcoming emerges in its strongest form being able to deliver no less than pure fun and actionmay be easily branded as merely another attempt to duplicate the successes of its predecessors an action comedy flick with heavier leaning on the funnier side but is also everything else its a suppressed love story about a fat middleaged woman harboring an intimate yet unrequited feeling for her partner its also a story of an inferiors struggle trying to get past a career level where shes been long stuck at the development in the latter proves to be a lot more rewarding for susan as it transforms her to something shes long wished to be giving her the chance for her talent and skills to be demonstrated this rings truth for mccarthy too who surfaces here with her most impressive comic showcase yet this is 810 for me,comedy
i avoided this bomb for 3 years but with little other choice of things to watch and my sister saying she had enjoyed it i gave it a chance full of things even a child would not find funny the likes of fart jokes and excessive profanity but unfortunately completely void of humour and they are considering a sequel,comedy
writerdirector paul feigs comedy is a homage to secret agent films starring a bumbling female named susan cooper played by melissa mccarthy i liked this movie better when it was called austin powers i mean susan cooper international woman of mystery ok i am just kidding did not turn out to be a bad filmmaking mission but i did not think it had enough creative mojo for top ratings as it received from many critics again mccarthy stars as susan cooper a desk bound cia analyst who volunteers to go undercover to prevent global disaster yes we have heard this premise before but feig keeps it moderately entertaining and it does help that mccarthy does a commendable job in her starring performance as cooper rose byrne brings some fire into the picture also as the fem villain rayna boyanov byrne and mccarthy again bring some solid chemistry in scenes together jason statham was hilarious as the foulmouthed rick ford even though feig criminally underused him was not a master production but its worth to go on that possible mission of getting under your covers and taking a peek at it  average,comedy
i havent laughed this much at a film in a good while top notch film that plays off of the interplay between the evil villain rayna boyanov rose byrne and the good susan cooper melissa mccarthy im not a melissa mccarthy fan at all and was amazed that mccarthy and this movie hit a home massive home run on this onefor those wanting to get valuable feedback you should know that the negative reviews are way off the mark and possibly and written by stooges for a rival film studio or something or people seriously lacking in any sense of humor whatsoever i highly recommend this film,comedy
reallife link well this is far from reality and its is very unlikely that someone out of training for ten years like susan cooper turns out to be the she is it is also unlikely that a skilled woman like susan cooper sacrifices her career for a men and love so there is no actual link to real life and there is no clear message that can be identified however the movie is very enjoyable the intention is not to preach real life but to entertain and so it does there are a lot of scenes when you have to laugh out laugh like the one when jason stathams coat gets stuck on the door and it is quite interesting since it has a story that keeps developing and keeps you interesting the casting is just amazing miranda hart is just fabulous and so is jason statham i would definitely recommend it,comedy
every character in is spot on kudos to the casting departmentmelissa mccarthy is one of my favorite actresses in she is very entertaining as usual i read that she did her own stuntswhat jason stathams character is a delightful change from what im used to seeing him do jude law is a hoot i havent seen miranda hart before but will be sure to watch her from now on shes great peter serafinowicz had me cringing which was what his character was supposed to do the entire cast is wonderful and their chemistry seems to be fun and relaxed comic timing is excellent writing and directing couldnt be better the premise and execution are perfect this is the most entertaining movie ive seen in a long time,comedy
unfortunately after almost a year since its release the rating of this film and the positive reaction of people are still flabbergastingi watched this comedy about a month or two ago with a friend hoping for a good laughoutloud since it had a rating of 72 i think at that time well what we got was a very predictable clichd mess it starts out decent right up until a character dies first 1015 minutes or so and no its not a spoiler and guess what our nooneseesmenoonelovesme field adviseror whatever she was becomes a why because she went berserk some time ago and apparently thats how little it takes to be sent on a stakeout i for one was not expecting that kind of turn of events so coolso needless to say everything goes downhill from here you can figure out the whole movie from the first 20 minutes thats how good the plot twist is mainly because you have seen this so many times before in the same belowaverage comedies sure you squeeze in a chuckle or two but thats about it they try really hard to be funny but the jokes are used up and constantly swearing is not a gogo in the world of refined sense of humor unless your humor has its capital in adam sandlerville71 people come on i still have hope for humanity dont take that from me i give it a 4 and thats me being a really nice guy about it,comedy
my quick rating 7310 a very impressive movie to say the least melissa mccarthy again is hilarious and does so by juggling the part of a midwest everyday women and immediately changes on the fly into raunchy oneliners so well the ease which she shows on screen is wonderful and so fresh in seeing what she calls big women movies as not being some stupid vehicle or drawback just another performance along the way in good performances is jason statham completely making fun of his own characterreal life persona he is typecast into it is obvious to tell he enjoyed poking fun at himself just the beginning of course since the story itself was a nice throwback to the genre movies with double crosses and who is on whose side twists not saying any were all that surprising but still added to the entertainment value the action scenes are nicely edited together and make sure to be just unbelievable enough to also illicit a laugh from them overall along with sprawling scenes around the globe and production values being top notch it is hard to find flaws in such a surprisingly good flick so leave it at check this one out  you will not be sorry,comedy
in a world where people are fighting against misogyny and sexual dominance this movies takes a step back from all that and actually portrays melissa mccarthy as a unseeded rock stariam serious she is just fantastic in the movie and makes you carries the movie from the start to the end when i saw the trailer i was wondering if they are gonna make a slap stick comedy and just add a element to it but hell no you get more refined educated and thought out comedyi was surprisingly laughing out loud for many comedy relief and the timing and length of comedy were just perfect the premise looks like a entourage movie but ends up being a funny movie more a like a buddy cop move with much more heartthe characters are very well used jason statham jude law rose byrne placed perfectly and take their time in pacing things just to give you a feel for the characters which is fantastic sometimes i thought jason statham was over the top but he was so annoying and the movie made good use of such a a clever characterisation kudos melissa mccarthy was just very cool i could see her as a back office operator could see her as a a friend you name she kills it every role that she portrayed was just fantastic it was just like a get smart but without the obvious overhyped totally unwarranted portrayal of the spies i can watch this movie again and can easily watch with my friends around i saw the plot twist coming so no real surprises there but again the only downside with such movies has always been the end and this movie suffers that as well when the bag of tricks are all over the movie comes to a screeching halt with loud noise and mindless chaseshowever that should not even bother you with the movie experience as a whole a fun movie with witty jokes very likable characters who have justified their roles with their innate acting skills,comedy
i had a good time of laughs with this movie melissa mccarthy is a good physical comickind of like lucille ball shes got good comedic timing and facial expressionsyes she capitalizes on her looks but it didnt and doesnt take away from her talent but adds to it imo some things are just funny to seelike a heavy girl on a motorbike falling over thats in the trailer so no spoiler here ok the language is rough but no rougher than any drama out there these days its where we are as a society so unless you want to hide out in the hills its what you hear but gosh to hear it coming from melissas mouth  it is funny because you know its a put on by her characterjason stratham well he definitely makes fun of himself nuff saida fun time at the movies  i dont take it more serious than it was supposed to be,comedy
comedy and now action director paul feig is back at it again with his newest movie is definitely the most funny mission movie out there and there is actually some very entertaining action in it both categories are handled expertly and by the time the movie finished it had exceeded my expectationspaul feig is a natural comedy director and there is no shortage of comedy in this movie it leaves plenty of room for action but the comedy is ramped up and ready to roll right when the movie starts melissa mccarthy is a natural comedic actress and she is certainly funny in this movie but surprisingly jason statham was actually the funniest person in this movie his character is almost a spoof on his previous movie characters because he always plays badass serious men in he plays a over the top version of himself which is hilarious statham really nails it on this one the supporting cast is not only funny but also extremely well chosen by the casting directorsthe storyplot is actually quite generic but considering that this is a comedy movie it almost makes it seems like a spoof of classic movies basically mccarthys character has to go undercover to find a nuclear bomb and stop bad people from using it to blow up the world a small gripe i have was that the movie dragged on just a little to long especially in the third act its all made funny and entertaining though with the barrage of comedic relief and action that is present in the whole moviesurprisingly the action in this movie is really well done i was expecting this to be more focused on the comedy and the action would be toned down but instead there was very enjoyable action throughout the movie from intense and silly carscooter chases to silly gun shootouts this movie packed in quite a bit of actionin the end had a great humor and a nearly perfect cast the plot was generic but still fun and the action was extremely entertaining my expectations were certainly blown away by this hilarious summer action movie,comedy
excellent parody of action movies delightful comedy the acting is of superior quality top notch directing i vote for best comedy in the past 5 yearsthose who criticize this movie ahave no sense of humor bhave a totally different sense of humor cwere expecting a serious action movie dhave a high level of intolerance to cursing estrongly believe that the movie makes distasteful fun of fat people actually it makes fun of everything handsome guys with no balls tough guys barking dogs dont bite beautiful girls who think they know better and no dear dislikers those who gave a high rating to this movie are not dumb stupid or uneducated rather the contrarylaughter is age culture and educationsensitive moreover comedy is one of the hardest genres to create not everyone laughs at the same jokes some of the jokes in the movie are plain silly very in your face others are extremely refined the combination is exquisite,comedy
what is better than a very wellwritten raunchy comedy with the heat and now this flick feig has made melissa mccarthy the star in his movies and let her go absolutely ball nuts which is a joy to watch i didnt think bridesmaids was that good though and the movie is peppered with tons of witty lines psychical crazy comedy and an amount of splatter as well her character susan cooper starts out as very sweet and innocuous at first but later on becomes more violent and fouler in mouth but what is so brilliant is that even then she still manages to make the character admirable and some of the innocence is still there even then miranda hart is also doing an equally terrific job as nancy susans friend who ive got to say is just as adorable as mccarthys character is just as much did i highly enjoy rose byrne as rayna who even in her nicest moments had an insult in charge for nearly every sentencebut as much as i love mccarthy in the movie and i really do jason statham stole the show the way he plays a parody of pretty much every tough character he has been and does it with such flavor too is priceless yes i see what other people mean when they point out how inconsistent his character is at first ridiculously skilled then the clumsiest and stupidest person ever but he was so marvelously goddamn funny that im willing to overlook thatoh and how did i forget peter serafinowicz as aldo he was hilarious at first i thought he would only appear in one scene as some random wacky ladies man susan meets on the street but when his role got bigger i was pleasantly surprised and best thing of all his schtick gets even funnier instead of too oldi cant remember the last time i laughed so much when seeing a movie at the cinema im terrible at remembering quotes and then i still actually recall a few from this moviethe direction itself was very creative too the action scenes were intense and deliciously violent and some of the camera pans looked really cool this is how you do action unlike coughmcgcoughbut do you know what really surprised me the writing was actually incredibly clever i wont spoil anything because this review is really just for people who havent seen the movie its the kind of comedy where you need to hear all of the lines while watching the movie for maximum comic effect and not have them spoiled before you do thats just how funny it is i will just say that some of the twists were whut enough that it made for an intriguing story how often do you have a comedy with a great twisteven so this movie is not complete perfection a couple gags were dragged out for too long the amber valentine line was only funny one single time and only got less and less funnier for each time and the inclusion of 50 cent is albeit amusing shoehorned as fuckbut trust me you can easily overlook those flaws recommend this movie to your family and friends youll truly have a blast,comedy
i dont know why the level of vitriol for all the reviews of this movie actually i do and it reflects poorly on the reviewers some hate on the lead because she doesnt suit their idea of what a movie star ought to look like others hate this movie because it isnt art with a capital a some people seem to write hateful reviews because they are compelled to put something down in writing and they arent clever enough generous enough or willing to see a movie for what it isi got news for you folks not every writer is a shakespeare and not every artist is a picasso theres room for norman rockwell in the pantheon of great artists never mind the critics this is a fun movie you spend your twelve bucks youll be entertained ms mccarthy is charming sweet and funny shes perfect for this role the concept is funny stratham is hilarious the only minus was a lot of curse words  if it werent for that id have loved to take the kids to see itif youre only interested in movies as art stay home if you hate people on the basis of an unrealistic demand that they all look a certain way stay home if youre a blushing wallflower that cant handle rough humor or curse words stay homeif youre interested in a wellmade funny movie that you can watch and be entertained for a while go youll be glad you did,comedy
i dont get where out of the blue a creature on earth decides to make something this stupid i seriously would like to see just how stupid you must be if you made a movie like this i truly would you couldnt even be a human youd be some other mutated genus that is unidentifiable every species i think of wouldnt make a movie this bad not dogs not cats not giraffes not gazelles eagles turtles frogs dinosaurs no animal can be as stupid as the human race is here there was a time humans would never have pulled this stuntthe movie in the trailers already is lame looking we used to have lord of the rings brilliant movies like master of disguise mission impossible star wars harry potter pirates of the carribbean so you the director decide to not honor the tradition of great movies you make garbage like this i wonder if its for like hoodlum nine year olds who actually like this kind of stuffi dont know if plenty of people lined up for a movie like this but it looked boring from the trailer and man was it boring to see film makers must be getting desperate nonstop rudities and vulgarity that was not the least bit attractive or funny and this woman who plays the is not funny i hope she doesnt come in more movies very annoying to see,comedy
is a good movie with a very well written storyline and a terrific comedic cast its a very funny clever parody of the genre as we see melissa mccarthy in one of her funniest performances to date forced in on a real super mission mccarthy is also joined by a stunning cast that includes rosa byrne jude law alison janney jason statham and the hilarious miranda hart director paul feig takes big advantage of these actors willingness to improvise and ad lib i felt that jude law was very underused i loved the way he portrayed this character i would liked for bradley to have had a bigger role his characterisation was brilliant and the long period in which he was absent disappointed me some of the humour was immature at times which is the main reason i dropped it from an eight to a seven featuring fart jokes bats in the workplace characters pining over mccarthys character some of the humour was so clever that the jokes like that really brought me down it may have its flaws but is good fun and its talented cast certainly shine i would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy susan cooper is tasked with a real mission beyond the grounds of her office space best performance jude law,comedy
this show brilliantly uses the best comedy elements of wit satire observation comedy and slapstick then delivers them with so much heart and style that this film has earned my 10 star ratingim normally put off by vulgar language because its generally used to generate an awkward nervous laugh for an example reference the entire career of dane cook but instead of handling it like a bludgeoning weapon the script treats its subdued use of profanity like a scalpel delivering oneliners which me and my wife will be quoting each other for weeks as well as brilliant banter exchanges which showcase an amazing comedic chemistrythe show is smart confident quirky fun and most of all hilarious every scene with melissa and miranda playing off each other is cinematic gold without contest this is the best movie ive seen all year ignore the sad trolls giving 1star reviews most of whom im certain havent bothered to actually watch the movie theyre reviewing and go see this movie,comedy
a cool and good movie good actors alomst like james bond and kingsman all the locations were wonderful and paul feig is a great director he should make the next james bond movie i liked that the woman in this movie had to be different persons to be invincibleits better than a lot of the bond movies and as good as kingsman i give it 1010 i hope there will be more moviesall the male actors were also really great the actions and all the funand i liked the scene were he faked his death but she didnt knew that was the best part when you see him again the song was wonderful could have been a bond song i love these kind of movies,comedy
wow this movie might very well compete for a good spot in my top five of 2015 i loved almost every minute of this fantastic comedyspoofaction film lately as much as i began loving melissa mccarthy when she arrived on the scene it actually takes some convincing as of late to see one of her films ever since she took over the obnoxious tammy role  even before the movie tammy came out ive completely disliked her repetitive nonsense of a nasty woman now i must always put the disclaimer when shes brought up oh i do love the nontammy mccarthy mercifully she completely abandons that tired and repulsive character here and we can see true comedic talent and timingshe was excellent here stealing every sceneeven from some talented and great actorsaction stars she opposites the movie itself was hilarious but she truly showed perfect timing and ease in a character that was supposed to be anything butwhat was truly refreshing was that this was an absolute spoof off of the james bond series and yet was an action comedy on its own it begins telling you this is a mockup of 007 and then becomes a standalone i loved that bravery and originality in a spoofwhile not 100 perfect and a few scenes couldve been reduced it was so incredibly entertaining and downright hilarious the greatness outweighed the bad by a landslide highly recommended and cant wait to buy on bluray once available cmonsequel,comedy
writing a review of a film for which i have no strong opinion is always  something of a tedious task but less than 48 hours after sitting  through 20th century foxs i find myself having trouble recalling  more than a handful of moments that truly resonated with me the film  marks the third teamup for director paul feig and funny lady melissa  mccarthy  the duo previously worked together on the heat and  bridesmaids which served as mccarthys breakout role  and the formula  is definitely beginning to wear out its welcome  this time around mccarthy is susan cooper a cia agent who spends her  time behind a desk as the handler for bradley fine jude law a  dashing james bond clone with whom susan is smitten when a mission  goes wrong cooper volunteers to be sent into the field to clean things  up  much to the surprise of her boss alison janney and fines rival  rick ford jason statham  cooper is tasked with keeping tabs on the daughter rose byrne of a  wealthy arms dealer as she partners with an intermediary bobby  cannavale to secure the sale of a nuclear weapon if youre familiar  with mccarthys other work then you can probably guess that she  bumbles and fumbles her way through the mission getting herself deeper  entrenched in the dangerous world of espionage  the film takes a somewhat surprising twist around the halfway point  with susans personality undergoing a dramatic change that makes her  interactions with the other characters infinitely more entertaining  this is also around the time that significantly ramps up the  action including a wild chase scene through the streets of budapest  complete with plenty of mayhem and collateral damage and a hilarious  handtohand combat sequence in a restaurants kitchen  unfortunately it takes entirely too long for to get to this point  and sitting through the first hour is an exercise in perseverance the  action scenes and the added humor are a welcome addition but as with  most other movies about secret agents the third act pulls out a couple  of implausible surprises that strain credulity  even for an absurdly  comic outing such as this one  but the biggest problem with isnt the length or pacing  although  both of those are big issues  its that most of it feels bland and  unimaginative take for example susans lecherous italian wheelman  peter serafinowicz who cant seem to keep his hands from wandering  to her breasts and buttocks every few seconds its mildly amusing  if  not a little creepy  the first time but it quickly wears out its  welcome by repeating endlessly it just feels lazy as if the writers  couldnt be bothered with giving the character any personality traits  other than this one  mccarthy is about as good as can be expected but shes not really  stretching the limits of her range here and law is wellcast as the  mischievous and debonair secret agent archetype but the films  funniest moments come courtesy of byrne and statham the latter of  which is at his absolute comedic best in a role that can only be  described as a swaggering foulmouthed version of inspector clouseau  is neither a great film nor a terrible film  it merely exists  and seems to perfectly comfortable with that achievement alone moments  of vapidity and comic brilliance are doled out in equal measure with  enough to ensure that audiences wont regret buying a ticket but they  likely wont be terribly excited about spending that ten bucks either,comedy
so here is really a good comedy mix with action actually it is comedy that a fat women doing a good action but really i like this movie women is pretty smart much fat and also very powerful action was amazing i am surprise how did she did it thats nice she is in cia and just doing good work to beginning to end i dont know what is need of jasan stathom here he dont need to do a fool role side role in this movie its just like he is making his image bad i know him as a father of action when he do something like this its really not good here he is trying to do comedy but i wanna say he is not good at comedy he is only and only for action well movie is pretty nice and she is really much smart in this movie she just making rumor to a big women willan with just some images memory thats one part i like it much,comedy
it seems this is the year of films but this one plays it a bit differently as is a straight up comedy and i gotta say it does its job really well and is a great film the premise of this film sees a nuclear bomb saleswoman get all the names of the cia agents so to track her down they send in a complete unknown agent i have never been a huge fan of melissa mccarthy but in this film she totally works she is really funny in this film in different types of ways you like her character and believe in her character as she goes on her journey and adapts to the different situations the supporting cast is also just fantastic rose byrne plays the villain and just like she was in bad neighbours she is hilarious and plays the villain up perfectly for this film jude law is great as a sort of james bond ripoff and plays it up really well throughout the film the real show stealer in this film though is jason statham who plays a complete parody of him in every action movie he is in he monologues about how tough he is and it is utterly hilarious and watching him in action was the best part of the film with his chemistry with mccarthy being great to watch the journey that the characters go on is really cool and as i mentioned before it is great seeing melissa mccarthys character adapt and change as the movie went on and i liked that however if you have seen any films before you have seen all the twists and turns before and it doesnt hit the emotional impact that it wants to hit the script is really really funny with all the dialogue that is intended for humour really hitting its mark and should make you laugh allot however the film tries to hit a bit of a dramatic level and it just is basic and easily is the weakest part of the movie the style of the film is great i couldnt believe how good the action scenes were and how cool they made these characters overall is a little bit below kingsman but it is still great and definitely worth the watch,comedy
if you fancy a good giggle then i recommend you get to see the latest offering from director paul feig and brilliant comedy star melissa mccarthy susan cooper mccarthy is a deskbound cia analyst who volunteers to go into the field following the disappearance of a suave superplayed by jude law and stop the black market sale of a nuclear bombthis is a great spoof film and i was relieved to see that mccarthys character wasnt a female johnny english she wasnt the bumbling fool who doesnt really fit in but a fieldtrained agent who knows exactly what to do and carries out her mission with determination resourcefulness and the frustration of having to get around cocky overconfident agent rick ford played superbly by jason stathamthere were times during the movie when i felt that the director had given the actors the synopsis of the scene then sat back watched and probably laughed like the rest of us as they just did what they do bestjason statham played on his toughguy action hero persona with a straightface and such a deadpan manner that the comedy was much funnier than had he tried the slapstick approachthe rest of the cast were terrific and it was all in all a good movie with some good action pieces and some great comedydefinitely worth seeing,comedy
its a good one time watch with some scenes which are down right hilarious but the rest fall flati give it a 5 but 2 additional points only for statham  every time hes on  you simply crack upjude law is decentmccarthy overdoes it in partsbyrne is superbaction scenes are overdone with forced humour infused in though its an ok spoof lady jamesbondish attemptover all time pass,comedy
another comedy that pays tribute to the 007 genrethe story is somehow nice susan cooper melissa mccarthy is a proper hero and not a mr bean johnny english kind of thing it has its moments and mccarthy and byrne deliver their characters nicelyjude law is not colin firth kingsmans movie but he is doing ok statham tries to be funny but for the first half of the film he is overacting and is subpar later after you acknowledge that his character is ridiculous you might have some fun with but he is not an asset for the filmit is a well thought comedy and it shows it isnt boring and you might have a couple of surprises as you go plus there are some violent moments that you might overpass while you are watching it as a pure comedyoverall recommended it is not kingsmans but you might have fun with the overthetop 007 genre once again,comedy
hilarious thats the only way i can describe it was so refreshing to finally see a movie that gave me some great belly laughs and was super fun to watch from the beginning to the very end i felt like i wasnt just watching the movie but it felt like i was riding along on the adventure the chemistry of the cast was perfect and i hated it when the movie finally ended luckily they actually set it up for a sequel which i hope comes relatively quick since great comedies are hard to come by latelyif youre going to let your kids watch the film just be warned that melissa mccarthy uses some pretty colorful language from timetotime but it really isnt anything kids dont hear at school and among their friends i am sure jason statham was a pretty intense and funny field operative and i can honestly say that his character really added the perfect balance to the overall story as far as jude law is concerned i have only two words james bond jude could be the next bond one day he played a really self obsessed that was oblivious to the obvious yet intune with his skills overall this movie was a blast and i would highly recommend it to anyone that want a great comedy,comedy
outstanding and hilarious in all way i absolutely loved it this movie is beyond beyond funny the plot was good enough and melissa mccarthy took the movie to another level she was hilarious and acted brilliantly so far its one of the best comedy movie i have watched this year i laughed a lot when i was watching this movie i loved this movie because of melissa mccarthy she was unbelievably much hilarious in this movie loved the plot as well and the casting was great too direction was appreciate able melissa is the best part of the movieshe is like the soul of this movie she absolutely nailed it such a great actress statham did good deal with this movie rosy was fine i seriously watched this movie at least for 10 times and every time i loved it equally i still remember the fight scene of melissa mccarthy it was something else must watch movie,comedy
this one really surprised me getting into it with such low expectations that it couldnt go anywhere but up but i was still surprised while i can get why there is a lot of people that hate this movie i find it to be quite entertaining brilliant and unexpected casting for every single role in it except maybe jude law jason statham is hilarious theres something i never though id say and as for melissa mccarthy lets just say im not such a big fan but after this movie i might be converted as for the movie itself some might call it naive impossible and unoriginal but it has its moments some twists and turns i really did not see coming and it literally made me laugh out loud on several occasions sure id make it 20 minutes shorter but that is not really an issue all in all dont go into too deep and start looking for a meaning or anything artistic cause youre not going to find it if youre just looking for a laugh and have 2h to kill with nothing better to do look no further,comedy
greetings from lithuania2015 is a very entertaining spoofactioncomedy it features great acting seriously for this material i mean by everyone involved but kudos to melissa mccarthy rose byrne and jason statham yes jason statham in this movie he kinda plays himself or his heroes from previous flicks but this is very on point  it is hilarious performance plot is very generic but it is also on pointoverall features some truly funny moments and there a lot of them great acting and overall pacing at running time 2 h is almost flawless there is a bit dragging in second part of this movie but ending is very good and funny if you like some good action spoof comedies is not to be missed,comedy
is everything this years hot pursuit wished it was a giant femalecentric laughoutloud action comedy thats sprawling in its setpieces yet shining in its silliness through its physical comedy and unexpectedly cool combat scenes it still manages to feel like a screwball comedy throwback with stellar verbal sparring between the great actors so its not groundbreaking like mad max fury road or mindboggling like ex machina but those arent the goals will simply make you happy nothing more nothing less and sometimes thats really enough much of that pure joy comes directly from the cast from top to bottom these gals and guys propel to higher levels than movies of its kind often get everyone just seems to be having an absolute blast and that fun is contagious janney and byrne stand out as solid and strong comedic presences hart and statham steal every scene they are in each playing with their own hollywood identities to great effect at the center of it all mccarthy and feig steer the ship swimmingly often managing heartbreaking honesty and sidesplitting hilarity all at once this mixture can at times make the proceedings feel more cute than lol funny especially as the movies somewhatlong runtime feels its length however as you settle into the world you cant help but love the ways in which it takes the selfrighteousness out of thrillers by highlighting the hilariously mundane minutiae will it change your world or even really challenge you intellectually not in the least but it will undoubtedly make you laugha lot,comedy
i found it hilarious within the first minute and was laughing heartily throughout the entire movie but theres no denying that the action sequences are incredibly well done specifically the fight between susan cooper mccarthy and a female assassin in a kitchen the opening sequence of cooper alerting bradley fine law where enemies are while fine sweeps them up in a rat maze full of baddies and the scene with the car where cooper mops the floor with a handful of terrorists with little to no effort the best part was melissa mccarthys role she was too funny if you are melissas fan dont miss this movietruly recommend,comedy
let me be honest i love films which cleverly parody a genre it almost doesnt matter what the genre is i just love them this is one of those films yes its not especially subtle but its bloody funny its rude its violent it has its tongue very firmly in its cheek and it really doesnt care who it offendsis it oscar material no not even nearly but its clever it has a plot which while not particularly sophisticated still works and it has some great comedy from some unlikely actors particularly jason statham who is so ridiculously over the top that he stole the show for meive never been a great melissa mccarthy fan sorry but in this she was excellent,comedy
this was great i was laughing so hardi especially enjoyed the kitchen fight scene i thought it was very well done funny good action and i loved that it was in a kitchen v subversivei loved how in the blink of an eye melissa mccarthy went from mildly cringing innocent bystander who happened to save the life of an evil rich lady to bodyguard hired by said ladys late father and who doesnt give a s anymorealso the writing made so many nods to things that happen in movies and in real life to women mccarthys boss allison janney hooray wasnt always nice to her but she made a point of giving her credit for her work the field mccarthy worked with for twelve years was actually not as nice as he seemed faking her out with a crummy present in a fuzzy hinged jewelry store box but even worse convincing her to remain his handler when she could have been a field agent years ago so basically sweettalking her into letting her career stall for his benefitanyway nicely done i hope to watch it again in a few years with my son when hes old enough,comedy
loved this movie silly funny and raunchy melissa mccarthy was a totally quick witted badass,comedy
jason statham hilariousmelissa mccarthy so funny rose byrne excellent funny miranda hart classic funny peter serafinowicz funny sleaze bobby cannandale jude law allison janney everyone was fantastic and had such a big part in making this movie so much fun brilliant lines great fun so many laughs we busted our guts laughing i cant believe some people gave this one star  im so glad those people arent in my life they must have no sense of humour btw we are a couple in our 50s so dont think for a minute this is a young person moviebrilliant lines story acting action and ridiculous hilarious fun we hope for 2 and a proper face off machine,comedy
so i didnt like melissa mccartney i thought she was crazy i watched the heat and i didnt like it despite the fact that im a fan of sandra bullock but the trailer looked funny so here i am the whole cinema is empty i sneaked in during office lunch hour most of the audience were caucasians which was weird for singapore however when the movie starts i couldnt stop laughing everything was so funny and not even in a stupid waythey are genuinely funny melissa was not overthetop and shes pretty good at fighting i like rose byrne ever since she became pretty and acted in insidious didnt like jude law because i couldnt buy him acting handsome one complaint is that i dislike the guy characters susan was a strong heroine and somehow she couldnt stop men from making advances and why did she sleep with her enemy in the postcredits scene that was unthinkable,comedy
turns the whole world of international spies on its head and gets great laughs in the process of course those who love the bond movies just might get miffed since they are the ones being skewered bond could not hide anywhere in the world without someone recognizing him but susan cooper no one would ever suspect her of being a for those who could only see a fat lady trying to be a they need to get a life high fashion and size zero models are just as ridiculous when it gets down to it and this movie plays off of that theme to great effect its about time those folks got a comeuppanceno this is hardly great literature but so what i loved this and was rolling in the aisles many times during this movie the only negative i could see what far too many uses of the f bomb it was totally unnecessary might work better without them since they seemed to stick out like a sore thumb,comedy
i honestly refused to watch while it was in theaters cause i just thought to myself man is this gonna be another typical melissa mccarthy comedy cause her characters actually really started to annoy me but this movie was differentit surprised me to see melissa mccarthy in a really funny role again i thought she was great in this one she had great chemistry especially with jason statham and rose byrne i will say this however jason statham is the best part of the entire movie he steals every scene he is beyond hilarious i liked that this movie had an r rating and that it actually goes for it cause the movie is rude violent and i just really liked those aspects of iti do think however the movie is flawed first off even if this is a spoof to other movies youve seen the plot before theres just no avoiding that by now also some of the comedy aspects dont always work there was this one character that plays like mccarthys best friend and she didnt really do anything for me i really thought most of her comedy was pretty forced also a movie like this should never be over 100 minutes long that being said the last 20 minutes of this movie or so felt just forced and not all that funnynevertheless i enjoyed the hell out of it was really funny and i would definitely like to watch it again some time,comedy
is a comedy for those who like to have a laugh and just be plain silly paul feigs bridesmaids was the start of something special 2013s the heat was a successful dive in to the overused buddycop genre is just as engaging as these and carries just as many laughs melissa mccarthy has perfected her comedy satire her characters far less irritable than those in tammy and identity thief in a role that fits her personality mccarthy shows a combination of frailty and bravery as a desk jockey for the cia shes the eyes and ears of agent bradley fine jude law when all agents are compromised susan mccarthy enter the field placing her undercover reaps some of the best laughs of 2015 so far mccarthy may be on fire but its another particular person who crashes in like a blaze of glory jason statham his supergives it large reeling off all the brave acts hes committed i watched the woman i love get tossed from a plane and hit by another plane midair i drove a car off a freeway on top of a train while it was on fire not the car i was on fire when in actual fact hes a clumsy buffoon he makes life very difficult for susan which for us is a treasure to watch when hes off screen hes wanted back when hes on stage we dont want him to leave miranda hart rose byrne and jude law also add flare in one way or another is huge fun and a barrel of laughs even with its clich setups and stereotypical characters doesnt try to be anything other than entertaining and for that it receives great credit,comedy
similar to us seeing peak jim carrey in dumb and dumber or seeing peak will ferrell in anchorman we have seen peak melissa mccarthy and it is glorious is a cluttered ridiculous spoof action comedy that doesnt quite set a consistent tone but gives mccarthy the role of a lifetime and in return we get the performance of a lifetime even though you never quite know if you should ever take any part of seriously the movie entertains thrills and has a shocking amount of gruesome action to coincide with the plethora of jokes flying left and right throughout the two hoursunder the helm of paul feig which has mccarthy as his muse ala woody allen with diane keaton providing the writing and directing is a wildly violent and relentless sendup on action movies of all types from movies to the physicsignorant statham flicks that weve seen in the past decade what starts off as a whereisthebomb plot dwells deeper with twists and turns and has the mildmanned susan cooper usually working behind a desk traveling to europe to complete the missionthe cast is what ultimately delivers and carries this movie past any potential setbacks melissa mccarthy is phenomenal as her blend of sarcasm physical comedy and biting insults with perfect timing works perfectly here unlike most of her previous work she was not just the overweight woman in an unlikely situation there is much more to her personality in that makes her much more likable and much easier for us to root for her we see much more of her when compared to bridesmaids and the heat and it gives her a chance to truly stand out and shineand she does not disappointbut kudos to everyone else especially rose byrne as one of the antagonists and jason statham as a spoof of himself a good comedy relies more on chemistry and talent level on screen above the script despite that breaking most screen writing rules in the spectrum has the caddyshack syndrome whenever the storyline starts to drag at the slightest the movie does get unnecessarily complex you have the cast keep you engaged and entertainedwhat sets apart from the spoofs is the surprising amount of action we are treated to car chases brutal fights shootouts and even a big final rousing sequencealbeit having an unexpected ending what also allows to stand out is the abundance of strong powerful women from susan cooper herself to her coworkers her boss and even her adversary it is a welcoming change and a drift from the norm in this genre of filmeven though mad max fury road may have stolen some of its feminist thunderthis is paul feigs best work mccarthys best performance and one of the best movies of the year funnier than youd expect more actionpacked than you would anticipate and then throw in jason statham tossing some of the most astonishingly hilarious work out of any noncomedic actor ive ever seen this film is a hoot plain and simple and should finally allow us to take mccarthy much more seriously,comedy
the genre says action comedy crime it pulled out all of those things it was a solid film i wouldnt be surprised if they made a 2 later down the road all the characters did well jason statham was the funniest character always good to see actors that can ease into a other genres we all know how comedies are introduced nowadays the good ones are always rated r there is always nudity etc the only frequent thing in this film was the cursing which audiences will get over or find funny rose byrne did a wonderful job as well playing her role as well overall the film does what it was suppose to do get laughter with action,comedy
greetings again from the darkness melissa mccarthy and writerdirector paul feig are back together in hopes of recapturing their bridesmaids comedy and box office magic they are also reteaming for next years allfemale ghostbusters remakethis time its a parody of james bond films  right down to the elaborate and creative opening credit sequence recognizing that combining action and comedy can be a bit challenging feig enlists the help of jason statham and jude law statham parodies his well known uberintense characters with a running dialogue of his bravery and heroism while law is clearly having a blast as the ultrasmooth agent bradley fine think pierce brosnans bondin spite of the gentlemen this is ms mccarthys film and she is believable as the frumpy cia analyst who is the voice in the ear of super agent fine law he maneuvers the front line of dangerous assignments as she provides lifesaving hightech guidance from the relative safety of the vermininfested basement cia lab of course we know mccarthys agent will end up in the field in her attempts to avenge a mission gone wrongits mccarthy in the field that will either make or break the film for you her scenes with rose byrne and peter serafinowicz worked best for me while her jackie chanstyle kitchen fight scene and her chase scenes were a bit more difficult to buy off on it can be confusing as a viewer when we are constantly bombarded with pc rules and then feig and mccarthy dont hesitate to use her heft for laughsother supporting work is provided by british comedienne miranda hunt another fish out of water agent morena baccarin as a strutting super agent at the level of statham bobby cannavale as a wouldbe terrorist and allison janney as the cia supervisor while each have their moments its mccarthys visit to the gadget department that provides the best laughsthe actioncomedythriller genre is pretty sparse and as you may expect comedy is the priority for most scenes mccarthy does well in her first true film lead though my prediction is that her value as an actress will ultimately come from playing characters who are more real  like her role in last years st vincent,comedy
i love this movie its the best it was especially hilarious before the mouthy swearfest when her cover is blown im in no means a prude but there is nothing funny to me about this degree of foul language but if you skip over that part this movie is hilarious i loved melissa mccarthy in gilmore girls but not so much of the movies shes been in while i still commend her on excellent acting most of her movies werent my tastecant wait to buy this so i can watch it 1000 more times  this was the first movie ive watched with jason statham and adored him in this role bobby canavale whom ive loved for years is the only actor that i feel couldnt pull off his part well  i didnt enjoy him in the movie at all rose byrne  she was excellent in her role  omg that hairthank god your hair broke your fall,comedy
i liked melissa mccarthy in gilmore girls im a 46 years old male and i kinda enjoyed her other movies but im not a fan of heri heard everybody telling how good and surprisingly funny this movie is and decided to watch it rather than mad max my wife isnt interested in mad max and i was happy about my decision after i left the theaterthe beginning builds up slowly with a few jokes which made me smile but nothing uncommonthen the action started and it was hilarious i didnt dare to eat my popcorn because i was afraid of choking so hard i laughedthe second half of the movie is one huge firework of extremely funny one liners and action comedyi watched it with hungarian dubbing so maybe that added to the fun even more because hungarians can make a movie 10 times funnier just by translating it with more artistic freedom for example while jay and silent bob strikes back or asterix and cleopatra are boring in english and german they are amazingly creative and funny in hungariananyway watch it if you can,comedy
sure the movie is pandered to a very wide audience with broad comedic tastes but that doesnt make the movie inherently bad any movie that can keep me laughing from start to finish is a decent comedy no matter how childish or silly it may be at times the dialogue was actually more impressive than imagined and given melissa mccarthys recent sad excuses for films i was pleasantly surprised upon watching this some punchlines were delivered solidly and the action wasnt all too bad eitherthe movie wasnt anything special nor anything super memorable but i really enjoyed it all in all,comedy
i went into with low expectations but it ended up being hugely entertaining the plot is a send up of clich movies melissa mccartney plays susan cooper a cia analyst who supports suave field agent fine jude law soon enough fine is captured and killed by rayna rose byrne and cooper is sent out in the field in an attempt to track her down and prevent her from selling a nuclear devicemelissa mccartney often plays the role of a crass loud mouth boorish women but this role is a bit different susan cooper is at least at first a soft spoken and shy woman who pines after agent fine and avoids the spotlight there are moments of boorishness but its not overwhelming the real highlight of the movie is the supporting cast the obvious standout is jason statham he steals absolutely every scene he is in and his line delivery is nothing short of amazing rose byrne is great as the icy rayna and plays off of mccartney really well as does miranda hart who plays coopers friend and cia colleague the film altogether was incredibly entertaining my only issue was with some gratuitous gross out scenes and that the pacing could have been better at the beginning but otherwise it is worth a watch for statham alone,comedy
i registered because i felt so compelled to say this dont waste your time or money this one of the worst movies ive seen in a long time maybe everboring that its not even funnyhow the heck did this piece of utter nonsense has got a 710 rating is beyond me did they hire some company to spam review sites with fake positive reviewsits hard to find a good movie to watch nowadays  that said this movie is not just a bad half baked movie its horribly terrible in an indescribable waysigh,comedy
im giving it 3 stars for the opening sequence at which my husband said maybe we should by this dvd and the 3 or 4 truly funny moments the rest of the film deserves a 5 stars for the potty humor constantly throughout the film along with not a single character having the ability to string together 3 words without inserting the fbomb at least once some sentences are nothing but low language this film had genuine potential melissa mccarthy really shone in the action sequences a number of which i thought were truly funny but then she spoke again sigh and the penis sex and fart jokes detracted even more remake this film as a true james bond spoof with the witty dialog you see in those films and it could be a true winner in other words keep it in the vein of the opening sequence and id love it,comedy
the movie is nice and funny but it contains millions of offensive words each minute of it contains at least 10 bad words despite the porn ideas and intimations they have sent through all the movie simply it is not a movie to relax your mind with your familythe woman on the movie is really funny it is some how like mall cop but i couldnt finish it since i felt insulted from it it doesnt worth watching from my point of view there are a lot of movies out there has the same idea but much cleaner than this one and i really regret the minutes i wasted on it it would be much nicer and much much more beautiful movie if it was clean,comedy
this is one of my favorite comedies in the last few years genuinely funny all around my favorite melissa mccarthy performance as the likeable everyday hero jason statham and allison janey provide a hilarious contrast often stealing the scene with their supporting work plays out like a espionage thriller with an deft comedic touch this movie surprised me with its humor and heart and if you missed it definitely check it out,comedy
i actually really liked it until she started acting really tough and just spewing insults about 23rds of the way in i guess the idea is that she couldnt think of anything else better to do and was pretending this was her persona but at the same time it felt odd and pushed and like it was only chosen as her persona because the director couldnt think of anything better to do either if nothing else the insults were just too forced and too far but otherwise i found it surprisingly good and it wasnt just another one of her fat girl femaleversionof zachgalifianakiscomedies of course it had a lot of her classic type cast laughs but she managed to do something different enough that you didnt feel like you were just watching another movie with her as the fat weirdo sidekick i think part of that is because this character was pretty smart it helped a lot to make it less cringe and more endearing,comedy
this is one of the funniestsilliest yet cleverest spoofs on all things james bond some of the gags strained credulity but overall just about everything works from the opening featuring action and danger to the theme song to the gadgets and farflung locations  everything was spoton all the actors delivered with tongue firmly in cheek and jude law was surprisingly james bondishtrue as someone said the language is pretty salty and a few might find it offensive but theres a solution for that dont go to the movies problem solvedyoure welcome,comedy
is one of the best comedies of 2015 so far the film is just a giant spoof on films this is probably one of the best performances that melissa mccarthy has given since bridesmaids one person that i was surprised to see in this film was jason statham this is something new for jason statham and once he was on screen he would steal every scene because his character was very funny paul feig is starting to become one of my favorite comedy directors because hes probably the only one in hollywood who makes great comedy films i think everyone played there part well and the whole film wasnt just about melissa mccarthys character because when shes on screen in most of her movies she always steals the show but when there are different characters and are actually funny you actually have a great comedy film now in near the end of the film it started to lose some laughs which is the only negative part of the film if your a fan of action films this is a film that you should check out or if your a fan of melissa mccarthy you wont be disappointed after seeing this film im really excited to see what paul feig will bring us with ghostbusters 3,comedy
10 june 2015 film of choice at the plaza dorchester tonight  melissa mccarthy jason statham and jude law star in this james bond homage the format is pure 007 from the opening sequences leading into the opening credits which are an entertainment piece in themselves leading into the film proper thats where the similarity kind of skews off to the side dont expect to watch a classically written script with an award winning storyline because thats not what you will get this was simply the funniest film i have watched in a long long time ten years after joining the cia susan cooper is a brilliant analyst totally desk bound in a bat ridden cellar and completely in love with the agent she supports when the opportunity arises she goes out into the field and completely rewrites the rule book for undercover agents also starring the wonderful miranda hart this film entertained from start to finish and the audience laughed out loud all the way through if you are at all prudish about bad language please dont let it put you off there is plenty but try and go with an open mind i kind of think it was necessary for the plot go see this film funny funny funny,comedy
it seems as though lots of negative reviewers on here dont get why this is such a funny and brilliant film the director is way more intelligent than to just want to make a james bond spoof this is a breath of fresh air for people who are sick of films that serve male tastes and interests the feminist jokes go further than the absolutely brilliant lead played by melissa mccarthy with concomitant jokes about her being a very unlikely cool and genius successful for british intelligence theres the whole angle of her male companion who is at a loose end and trying to get in on her mission who cant help boasting about what hes achieved in the past jumping from high buildings using his jacket as a parachute for example and then she later shows him up and completely dumbfounds him with a line about how he might have two as his guns protruding from his back pocket his face as hes dumbstruck by this idea is priceless frankly im dumbstruck by the brilliance of everyone who made this film the timing is everything in comedy right well by some sleight of hand theyve managed to make an absolute symphony of action and jokes i dont know how they did it and im so impressed that i reckon ill remember this film forever its one of my greats absolute appreciation to everyone who made it thanks,comedy
in what is quite possibly melissa mccarthys funniest film to date pokes an obvious finger at the james bond empire offering up a great mix of hilarious gags likeable characters and well executed action scenesand it is with the latter that i enjoyed the film even more as mccarthy takes what screen time she can in getting her hands dirty and doing a lot of the action herselffor me its rare today for a modern comedy to have me laughing continuously the whole way through but does this over and over againyes its camp its rude its silly and features a cameo by my favourite eurovision winner but it works action hard nut statham takes the piss out of himself with glee as the rest of the cast enjoy playing larger than life characters that bounce off each other well whether viewed in its theatrical or extended version  just never lets up with memorable moments and quotes coming at you every few secondsif you dont find this funny maybe you need to have your chuckle muscle checked,comedy
even if i ignore the boring plot which was probably done in countless movies before the so called jokes are so bad theyre basically just insults and threats aimed at everyone you will be asking yourself when is the funny part coming,comedy
much has been said about mccarthy an amiable plussize lady as a viable movie star but there is no longer any question brash bold and believable at every turn is a showcase and a celebration of her as a performer,comedy
not bad at all 119 min well spentits hard to find movies these days but some how made it the humor is good without too many slapstick and melissa played the female role nicelythe use of f words by susan and ford is also very entertaining and not offensive guaranteed to make you lolthe hitech gadgets is surprisingly funny but yet useful during the missioncant wait for the sequel and hope 2 will be as good as this one with more f words,comedy
this movie brought immense enjoyment we missed it during its first round in theaters and the raving reviews piqued my interest after watching it on board a flight i believe this warranted an 8plus on imdb this was an ode to the uncool nobodies who got belittled and bullied all their lives as well as to the underdogs who did the donkey work while the lucky ones got all the credit and glory here the director painted a parody of the overrated and muchfantasized life in the world of secret agency and caricatured his supposedly cool field agents  the boastful the crazy the egoistic and all these suave and graceful creatures fell prey either to the brute force or the charms exerted by our overweight motherly chief protagonist improbable as it may seem she was more lethal than the whole good looking lot added together there was incessant laughter throughout even the antics by the britishitalian sidekick was amusing the acidic and fiery yet sincere interaction between the two lady characters was quite successful in creating an intriguing bond one would say almost a quasisisterhood the soundtrack was sizzling hot and seeing the oncejustashot jude law make a fool of himself was paradoxically still a turn on and the moral of the story in this secretive world was incredibly downtoearth believing in oneself is the key to success,comedy
ok so if the godfather is a 10 and plan 9 from outer space is a 1 this movie is a solid 8 is it groundbreaking  no is it making an important statement on the social and political issues plaguing the world no it is a comedic spoof of the movie genre so if you go into this movie expecting to be challenged emotionally or psychologically you will be disappointed but if you accept that what you are going to see is a silly comedy with some action and cameos from big stars then you will get what you paid for it is an entertaining silly comedy im guessing thats what they were going for and they succeeded,comedy
as 2015 will definitely be the movie year with the release of the blockbusters mission impossible rogue nation and the new james bond movie spectre it would be unfair to not have a spoof to celebrate the genreso here is a comedy about spies really weird and clumsy ones with melissa mccarthy taking the leading role knowing the comic potential of miss mccarthy i expected to have a great moment and i did but leave your brain home this is all about laugh and fun there is no plot just gagsmelissa stars as cooper a cia analyst secretly in love with the field agent she works with and is desperately trying to convince her boss that she can work in the field when her beloved agent is killed during a mission and the identity of the remaining field agents is disclosed cooper is sent for the first time in the field to infiltrate and neutralize an arms dealing organization as well as to recover a nuclear nuke before it fells within terrorist handsit is fun seeing melissa mccarthy playing the newbie with funny outfits and gadgets but the others cast members are also having a lot of fun playing their roles the most surprising one is jason statham who is more familiar with action movie than a spoof he was probably making fun of himself and its working miranda hart is also very funny as melissa mccarthy best friend who is as clumsy as her jude law is very sexy as a james bondesque even if we dont see him muchbeware though the language used is really crude and probably a lot of people would not like it but it is the new comedy standard we love more and more hearing rude lines in comedies just ask seth mcfarlane but you will still have a great moment watching this movie it would have been better if it would be shorter 130 minutes is quite long for a comedy i give it a 8 out of 10 for the great laughter and smile this movie brought me,comedy
jason jason  jason i expected melissa to be funny not you i expected you  jason to be allaction hero not melissa what a great example of trading places wow the comedy was lighthearted and fun  just like identitythief i love jude law can we give him a nickname like jay eldouble u great fun outside of aldowhen you throw him in its a laugh ride minute the cia agent in the ear was a great device that started out as a gag but ended up being a very useful tool i love it and when they turned it on melissai was in heaven nice use of the genre a little romcom maybe a little action  yep except scratch a little no major explosions fast car chases or other usual devices this was melissa playing against type and jason playing against type and aldo playing all types with a nuclear weapon thrown in just for giggles  by the wayfight scene with the knife and frying pangenius ubergenius what a great fight scene it was wonderful bravo i loved it and went back to review it again and again who told melissa that she could fight i hope that she asked for it i know that i would have i love movies like this and want to see ms change of identiies  do more globe trotting like mrbean im sorry johnny english can we hook her up with maxwell smart the rock and johnny english let that be the end of the trilogy and i will be a very very very happy movie watcher more melissa please please thank you,comedy
those who are familiar with the fruits of paul feig  melissa mccarthy cooperation should be prepared for the basic atmosphere and joke objects yes there is again some vulgarity and focusing on appearance but thanks to good pranks targeted on serious films and elaborated characters and performances valid for all main cast beginning from melissa mccarthy as susan cooper and ending with verka serduchka as himself bring forth multiple giggling momentsthe thriller elements are sophisticated as well and a certain duel in a kitchen can be easily regarded as distinctive as for related movies of course not all scenes are smooth and meaningful and many mccarthys characters achievements are evidently accomplished by stunts but still is a good entertainment with dozens of distinctive performances and a good example that a wellnourished person can successfully manage in the leading role as well btw also in 2015 forbes named mccarthy the third highestpaid actress in the world,comedy
my college showed this movie during orientation week i did not know what to expect it was sooo funny it may have been the best comedy movie ive ever seen the main character was so relatable and so awkward in all the situations she was very overweight and just so funny the action is actually also very well done at points it was like a james bond movie they obviously spent a lot of money on cinematics i highly recommend although it is extremely inappropriate i was sitting near some girls and some of the sex scenes just made me uncomfortable for a good laugh few movies can compare to the main character is just like a silly overweight middle age woman yet she wields a gun and knows how to use it,comedy
i went in to see this film with zero knowledge and zero expectations  i dont even think i saw the trailer i laughed the entire timethe movie plays out as a parody of james bond films and even pokes fun at the jason statham breakneck action type of movies featuring melissa mccarthy in one of her best roles yet as far as i can remember this is melissas first role in which she does not play the gross clumsy fat chick but instead portrays a fiercely intelligent tough 3 dimensional woman who ends up in ridiculous situations and ends up being incredibly skilled at fighting off gangsters sure  it may be unrealistic but it makes for a great interesting comedy susan melissas character is a relatable middle aged woman who is feminine takes good care of herself longs for unattainable love has a close girl friend who has her back and works her ass off you root for her you laugh at her shockingly good insults and comebacks and you understand her motives for her actions some of the characters seem to be poking fun at their stereotype in other movies of their career jason statham like i mentioned before is mostly cast in highspeed intense action films  and in his character goes above and beyond this ford stathams character believes himself to be so intense and invincible that all the other characters roll their eyes at him and basically tells him to just calm the eff down he ends up getting in the way and causing more problems than actually doing any good a fact that i personally loved to see play out give it a shot im buying the dvd as soon as it comes out,comedy
director paul feig and actress melissa mccarthy make one hell of a team since bridesmaids this duo have struck box office gold it seems like feig loves putting mccarthy in very similar roles particularly a character who works for law enforcement or some government intelligence agency in bridesmaids mccarthys character was a cia analyst who had the codes for all the nukes in the heat she was a hardcore boston police officer and detectivenow in shes an fbi agent with the previous two films there wasnt a element to them but with feig made his very own james bond film complete with a killer opening song and animated opening credit sequence but instead of daniel craig we have the wonderful melissa mccarthy well before we get to mccarthy we have jude law as bradley fine in an american accent the closest thing we get to 007 mccarthy plays susan cooper who is set in the fbi office in front of a computer giving fine directions in his ear piece to keep him from harmdue to some unfortunate circumstances with fine susan must go undercover to find a man named sergio bobby cannavale and an evil woman named rayna rose byrne who are in cahoots to acquire a nuclear weapon little did anyone know that susan is in fact a badass in the field and can take out a few bad guys of her own even if her undercover alias wears cat sweaters and old lady wigs susan going undercover truly angers rick ford jason statham another fbi agent who is a complete badass because he feels shell just get in his way let me just say this right now this is the best use of jason statham in an action movie ive ever seenin the beginning of the film mccarthy is as always funny but her trademark r rated dialogue doesnt kick in until she she lets loose in her awesome black outfit and she shows that she can kick some serious ass the laughs keep coming throughout the film from mccarthy statham byrne and mccarthys friend at the agency nancy the awesome miranda hart i know feig lets mccarthy let loose a lot in the form of improv and here she just kills it i was laughing so hard i had tearsnow since this is a film in the very same vein as 007 james bond there are in fact quite a few suspenseful moments homages to the bond movies some great twists and turns and some awesome fight sequences all in which were filmed very well with mccarthy in mind speaking of mccarthy she plays an excellent character here her performance here is among my favorites of her resume because she delivers a realness to her character with flaws and all everyone else turns in great performances as well here specifically jason statham who might be my favorite character in a movie this yearis another victory for the feig and mccarthy team its hilarious from start to finish and quite fun if bond ever met susan cooper he would have his work cut out for himhighly recommended,comedy
well seeing some negative reviews that go about it like this was no movie etc i am really really confused about what would these viewers would expect to happen when they saw the movie poster its crystal clear that this is a parody of a movie and not some tom cruise action movie like mission impossible this movie is what it claims to be and more its a parody but its really lifelike and shot really professionally with no less than a real movie of the genre the action scenes are awesome and theres also the humor built within what more can you ask of ok at some points they may get carried away or drag the jokes out too long but overall its a good attempt the lady rocked it although i think shes too fat for the part and i dont like her as an actress but she was more than ok jason statham was phenomenal as was jude law this was an awesome movie for its kind that made me laugh hard more than once and this was actually what i was looking for when i pressed play so nice movie laughs time wellspent moving on,comedy
i was in the mood for a great comedy and rottentomatoes had me convinced i would find it with melissa mccarthys newest alas rottentomatoes you failed me by no means a bad film but this film truly disappoints as a comedy most of the film is fairly mediocre mediocre script mediocre direction and probably mostly less than mediocre comedy which is really what this film tries to be in the end the fight scenes the car chases all mediocre ive always found mccarthy at her best when she plays a strong aggressive letitrip kinda gal and when those moments come in this film she was truly hilarious sadly that persona doesnt show up until past the midway point of the film and worse she does it only sporadically through the rest of the flick as a result only sporadic laughs the rest of the film and only making it worse i couldnt stop thinking about how large she is ya im going there shes uncomfortably large and it distracts sometimes kind of the way it use to affect me when i watched john candy on film when an actor gets that large it really affects your ability to buy into the notion that shes a cia operative and that she could do anything that shes shown doing on the screen the rest of the cast was mostly solid jude law was his usual charismatic self and rose byrne was a hot as ever but neither were given characters worthy of their talents even allison janney wisely chose to go uncredited ok i dont know that she chose that but if i were her i would unfortunately this is a meh film with comedy that mostly falls flat,comedy
i had a fantastic time watching this movie i think ms mccarthy has finally found the perfect groove for her brand of humor the movie was funny exciting a little gorier than expected and just a raunchy good time i sincerely hope there are more of these in the works because i would watch hours and hours of susan cooper kicking ass and creatively insulting peoplei was genuinely pleased with the action scenes they were very well done jason statham was utterly hilarious which was a nice revelation jude law with an american accent is a little creepy thoughthere were kids at our showing like under 10 and i think thats a wee young considering the cussing gore and brief flashes of frontal male nudity there were also a lot of senior citizens there too im a little in awe of the breadth of ages that were thereanyway funny from start to finish definitely stay for the post credits scene i cant wait for the dvd,comedy
the sad bulgarian clown story alone deserves 10 stars ive been watching this movie repeatedly for the past few years only recently did i see all the negative user reviews and am feeling a need to come to its defense most seem offput by any vulgarity and dont seem to know its a parody when they complain about the plot im pretty sure this crowd still considers oscar wilde a gold standard of humor worthy of their intellect the seemingly crude jokes in this movie were beside the point what is most hilarious about this movie are the characters major and minor and the crowned jewels of this movie were its stars melissa mccarthy and rose byrne just about every exchange between them is golden,comedy
i marveled at this films perfect balance between goofy comedy and drama normally when this is attempted the drama is destroyed not so here melissa mccarthy is the most entertaining comic actress working today and shes in fine formone aspect most people probably dont think about is the propaganda like much of hollywood especially tv dramas these days this movie is big time propaganda its a feel good story for the disgusting cia it also reinforces the fraudulent idea of terrorism all of which is state created furthermore it conditions us to the idea of a nuke in a briefcase and places the blame on rogue terrorists for those unfamiliar with the outrageous ugly truths of political reality i suggest you tune into fetzer and barretts false flag weekly news of course reading barrys conspiracy world would not do you any harm either,comedy
one of the best comedies to be released in the last years a leap forward for melissa mccarthys comedy a major show for paul feig a win for every single person involvedif this movie cant be faulted for something that thing is being low on laughs in some way the filmmakers find a way to make every single scene in the film culminate in at least one laugh that definitely speaks to the brilliance with which feig directs the film there are only two brief moments in the movie where i was taken slightly out for the rest there arent dull moments he doesnt resort to cheap or dull filmaking and injects every frame of the film with something to be absorbed and with vibrant energy be it slapstick or dialogue comedy this film has iconic moments in both and really teaches a lesson in how to do comedy right there are multiple jokes that i couldnt catch because i was laughing from the last one this film is also very very smart and treats its audience with respect delivering many jokes that take brains to get yet still have the same effect of the others stathams character is comedy gold and statham himself plays him to perfection with some of the best comedic timing ive seen really without exaggerating there was something about him that cracked me up every time he opened his mouth and his running gag is definitely the best one rose byrne is as always magnetic on screen and further proves her comedic chops melissa mccarthy doesnt resort to the same old jokes she stared with and continuously surprises with perfect timing jude law as always impeccablethere are only a couple of things that stop from being one of the great recent comedies and join the club of something like 21 jump street firstly and most importantly with the exception of jason statham the characters are more staples than funny but interesting characters to hang out with yes there are a couple of side ones that have a fun beat but for the majority it has a hard time defining its characters and i believe that is vital for a comedy especially for the rewatch value moreover there are jokes dispersed around the film that kind of fall flat there arent many but still they do come sometimes and make for a brief 23 minutes of dizzy watch before getting back on board finally a couple of dont running gags simply dont work and dont have any kind of brilliance for them to fit into what is for the rest comedic goldi strongly recommend not to miss this one in any way it is both a blast to watch and a tour de force on how to make comedy right,comedy
the movie was one of the funniest ive seen in a long time i watch mike  molly and enjoy it as well it really makes me angry to see comments made about melissa regarding her weight i dont even see her that way she is a talented funny woman who deserves all the accolades she gets people are so superficial and petty its brutal they only wish that they the same amount of talent that she has in their pinky fingerand for those reading this and thinking shes overweight too i am not and it shouldnt matter if i was anyways the cast was excellent and it had action and a god script i hope she makes lots of money good on her,comedy
absolute borefest i know people have already vented out their anger of how ridiculous this movie is with apparently no or very slim laughtersim just compelled to write this review and have got nothing new to add about this terrible terrible film honestly it has made it in my top 5 films i loathehaving said that i think ive rated it a bit higher trust me 5 is way higher but then i realized and maybe i enjoyed jason statham in his new act being his fan and all 5 stars for your role on breaking the stereotype hell i may want to come back some time later  probably change the rating because im fresh of watching jason in his funny guy persona when this wears off  id open up to the nightmare i just witnessed spanning over almost two hours idk what im going to do rate it a 1 no even that would be blasphemouslike many debated how this film got a 72 rating on imdb is beyond my comprehension and by every logic know to man filmmakers perhaps rigged and bribed their way to the top wait did i just used the word perhaps isnt this obvious that they most definitely employed such underhanded tactics to make this washed up piece of trash stay afloat and fool audiences in to watching annoying melissa mccarthy or that fat lady from bridesmaidsomg a 72 tell me that wasnt real o gosh faith lost it needs restoration i better sign off and put on nargis fakhris you guessed it that hot chick who can fight starrer madras cafe instead,comedy
im not quite sure why the reviews have been so negative i dont think ive been to the cinema recently and laughed that much seriously there was not a scene where i didnt laugh yes some of the humour is bathroom humour or physical but that doesnt mean its not funny jason statham stole the show for me he was absolutely hilarious and the recipient of many laughs i saw this with my friends all 20 year olds in a packed cinema with people of all ages really or 15 and up and everyone was laughing i think its a movie that no matter your taste in humour you will at least chuckle a friend of mine wasnt too keen on seeing this movie as he felt melissa mccarthy wasnt funny but he laughed so much and at the end of the film he thanked us for making him come and see it as he thoroughly enjoyed it if you are looking for a serious accurate film isnt the one but if you are looking for an easy film to watch and make you laugh is definitely the one and im dragging the mother to see it tonight well worth a watch,comedy
is yet another 2015 actioncomedy starring melissa mccarthy as susan cooper shes a desk jockey at the cia who never did anything with her life and now lives vicariously through the earpiece in superbradley fines ear fine is played by none other than the suave jude law a bond candidate at any stage of his career cooper monitors the s missions from a dank and ratinfested basement at langley along with her friend and fellow misfit nancy miranda hartwhen resident alphabitch and european villain raina boyanov rose byrne obtains a portable nuke cooper is tasked with her first field work ever essentially rayna knows all the top agents identities the likes of which include law jason statham and morena baccarin so cooper must go on an observe and report mission to prevent the sale of the deadly devicewhat follows is an occasionally complicated game of cat and mouse vs  whatever you want to call it its the story of a woman who believes shes nothing special and who must rise to the challenge of becoming a foulmouthed badass as only mccarthy can do director feig very clearly has an understanding and appreciation of the genre and pairs it nicely with mccarthys klutzy selfconsciousness and mouthy confidence there are a couple of gags that feel repetitive like the touchy feely italian guy but one element that stayed fresh and ultimately became funnier as the movie went on was the overthetop antics of jason statham throughout he makes progressively more and more outrageous claims of his exploits in an effort to overcompensate in the face of mccarthys unexpected success just some of his tall tales include posing as barack obama stitching a torn off arm back on with the other arm and surviving a complicated chase sequence that he flawlessly executed whilst onfire statham is just one member of an otherwise stellar supporting cast jude law is a solid choice as the insensitively narcissistic agent fine rose byrne delivers an atypical role as one of the bitchiest characters i have ever seen and even 50 cent shows up for a cameo ok so that last one isnt one of the bedrocks of the film but i laughed most heartily mccarthy is solid throughout but i dont know if shed be able to support the film on her own so hooray for supporting actors all together i think feig does a lot of things right with this comedy but it does tend to get bogged down occasionally with the complexity of the story im not saying its on the order of something like inception but the frequent inclusion of double agents and more traditional espionage story elements just doesnt really gel with this type of comedy if the comedyaction spectrum is tethered between spies like us and skyfall then this film is more like get smart with raunchier humor youll laugh a bunch but it does tend to stretch on a bit too long and frequently features unnecessary or tired jokesread the full review and others like it on the drivein zeppelin website,comedy
after reading the reviews of this film and watching the first 10 minutes i thought i was in for a treat to match goofy comedies such as naked gun johnny english and hotshots however the scriptwriting seemed to be caught in perpetual and unnecessary use of the f word not really sure why as this being a comedy the use of such vulgarity did little to raise a smile and actually became tiresome and offensive i did like the overall premise of this movie that a dowdy office agent gets put in the field to infiltrate a criminal plan bravo to melissa mccarthy for an entertaining performance ably supported by miranda hart and a nice hammed up cockney turn by jason statham just disappointed by the script given the box office success id imagine a sequel is in the pipeline i just hope they provide a few less fs and more laughs next time ,comedy
this is the biggest surprise this summer is a witty engaging and just plain goofy piein theface to the genre but its parody is so lovingly done by paul feig it could work as a standalone crime thriller this is melissa mccarthy in prime form contrary to what you might think her human punching bag days are over you could forget tammy and identity thief ever happened because this movie hones in her skill as a comedienne an actress and a force to be reckoned with perhaps almost as well as she did in her debut in bridesmaids her camaraderie with everyone on screen works so well because her charm wit and honest to god beauty is undeniable if theres anyone else to talk about its jason statham who steals the show in every scene hes in he knocks every laugh out of the park the advertisements serve the film no justice for i was skeptical too judging by how poorly they looked watch it and have a good laugh,comedy
since she started working for the cia homely and obese agent susan cooper has been content to be the unseen and unheralded desk support partner of superbradley fine in one operation gone wrong raina boyanov a ruthless international nuclear arms dealer takes down fine and threatens all the known cia field agents knowing her anonymity is the cias best option cooper volunteers to track boyanov down from there cooper awkwardly and fumblingly goes around europe disguised as frumpy matrons in order to stop boyanov and her evil plotsmelissa mccarthy totally owned this film as her own in her previous films her characters were very brashloud and quite unlikeable but here in you immediately take a liking to her delightful susan cooper and you will be rooting for her for the whole film make no mistake the familiar foulmouthed mccarthy persona does make an appearance but here it is in line with her undercover dutieseven if the marvellous physical comedy skills of melissa mccarthy is front and center on display here you also cannot ignore the comedic talent displayed by the other actors in the cast many of whom are more known for dramatic roles rose byrne was so on point as the megasnooty raina boyanov so funny in her straightfaced overthetop alphabitchy mode the rich comedic rapport mccarthy and byrne had with each other as mortal nemeses certainly buoyed the middle act it was so surprising that this glamorous actress is not averse to physical comedy as evidenced by byrnes comically painful scene as her character was pinned down under two heavyset men while her private plane was having antigravity issues my unexpected favorite in the cast is jason statham and his uncharacteristic portrayal of abrasive cia agent rick ford we usually see him as the strong and silent macho hero taking up the cudgels of the oppressed in his many action films he is still strong and macho but whoa statham is definitely not silent here this must be the first time i have heard him deliver lines in mileaminute speed as he proudly relates his many incredible career exploits never thought statham could ever be funny i really enjoyed his scenesjude law was right in his element as bradley fine a suave tuxedoclad secret agent and charming ladykiller allison janney plays coopers no nonsense boss elaine crocker gangsterish bobby cannavale plays the glamorous terrorist de luca tall and mousylooking miranda hart plays nancy susans supportive friend and coworker in their ratinfested cia basement roguishlooking peter serafinowicz plays aldo susans overly amorous italian backup agent all of them stood out in their respective portrayals helping mccarthy generate more laughs in their scenes togetherthis is the third time writerdirector paul feig is working with his favorite actress melissa mccarthy in bridesmaids mccarthy was funny as part of an ensemble of comediennes in the heat she was funnier sharing the screen with sandra bullock in mccarthy is the funniest she has ever been 810,comedy
it seems many reviewers here are having a bad day or um bad week if you want an entertaining wellmade movie this is the one for you dont be put off by pretentious wouldbe intellectuals who wouldnt know humor if it came up and kicked them in the ass there have been a number of spoofs made over the years this has to be one of the funniestfor the reviewer who didnt see the significance of the bats and mice at cia hq  the moviemakers are making the point that the cia is infested by rodents during the past week the national airport security service allowed almost 100 percent of contraband  including bombs on board aircraft despite literally spending billions on the security services they are sadly lacking in providing either security or service that was the point made in a very amusing way which proved too subtle for some go see this movie,comedy
hi guys the movie is not yet released for most countries so i will do a spoilerfree reviewacting good acting from the main cast they were witty emotional and good overall 810plot it was really a generic actioncomedy plot really nothing special some girl who never gets into the action finally does gets sort of badass then not and finally she does safe the dayyou knnow these kind of movies already but it was well executed 610scenerycamerawork good camerawork nice shots no shakycam just the way i like ithumor a lot of slapstick humor not my favourite though mccarthy did do some great improvjokes at least thats what ive read so 710 for the humor overall and mccarthy herself 810action 610 some funny action scenes but its limited to funny and not spectucular as you would expect so overall 6510 for me this movie had mccarthy and paul feig written all over it but not as funny as bridesmaides to megreat effort though,comedy
i laughed out loud so much in this movie my cheeks hurt this was hilarious i cant wait to see it again melissa and her sidekicks do a great job of entertaining you throughout the whole movie if there was one negative id say the use of the f word it wasnt needed to make the movie funny id take all the young adults i know if it werent over the top with f but other than that its very funny my sides and cheeks hurt at the end her hubby always plays a funny role and this was no different i enjoy seeing him as well loved it well done melissa,comedy
it seems this was the first big budget movie direction for this guy the lack of good direction was slightly alleviated by some better than average acting by most of the cast jason stathams character was rather forgettable but thats the writers and the director allowing that script to go ahead jude law surely would have been shuddering at the premiere of this and crawling under his chair when his character was on screen the character of aldo was quite funny all in all a typical ott movie in the realm of the naked gun series of movies melissa mcarthy did an average job but this whole movie was badly let down by people off screen,comedy
a very poor attempt at making a comedy moviethe worst comedy movie evereven epic movie and disaster movie were more bearable than this there was no originality or natural feel in even one of the comedy scenes in the movie it seemed as if someone was forced to create some comedy scenes at gunpoint quite probably the most overrated movie everi you are a jason statham fan or if you like comedy or action genre then stay away from this i cant comprehend why the actors would even agree to be in this movie especially jason statham,comedy
how the  can this be for 12 years and older there are closeups of penises in this movie this should be in the adult section that stupid penisscene does not even add anything to the movie the rest sure is pg12 i dont see why that pervert scene is in this otherwise enjoyable movie we liked it particular the slapstick the unexpected crazy narratives and the over the top bondstyle altogether well worth seeingi vote a 1 just because you can not allow children to look at mens erect private parts,comedy
reviewed by dare devil kid ddkrating 395 starsthe ace partnership between writer and director paul feig and actress melissa mccarthy evolves into something formidable with this raucous action comedy which simultaneously spoofs the espionage genre while providing some genuine thrills and scores of belly bursting laughs along the way it also manages to come across as progressive and unique without trying to shove an underlying feminist ideology in your face  a rarity for a simple actioncomedy trying to make a statementand thankfully it looks like hollywood is gradually figuring out what to do with melissa mccarthy she shines in this clever star vehicle showcasing her prodigious copious funny talents its a refreshing return to form for mccarthy and also features a hilarious supporting turn from jason statham a ribtickling espionage spoof that gives a confident femalecentered spin to the traditionally ultramasculine actioncomedy genre  offers further proof that melissa mccarthy and writerdirector paul feig bring out the best in one another,comedy
i know that the genre is as old as the hills thanks to the everlasting bond franchise so much so that even movie parodies have become commonplace therefore my hopes were only relatively high that melissa mccarthy could pull one off with little more than having a female as the lead being the main noticeable difference she plays a cia agent who spends her career sitting behind a desk providing intel for the real played by jude law however in a turn of events that is there to simply move the plot forwards she ends up being sent out on a mission and for once the hilarious consequences promised in the trailer actually prove to look trueonce shes unleashed on the world armed naturally with all the latest qstyle gadgets every must have in their handbag its pretty funny i was really enjoying the film especially her interactions with jason statham now whereas mccarthy is well used to comedy statham is hardly known for his sense of onscreen humour however he stole every scene for me and even though hes in it a fair bit he wasnt in it enough for my liking however as stathams involvement was decreased so did my enjoyment of the filmive seen a fair few films which i would describe as films of two halves normally theyre a bit slow to start but once they get going really do pick up and entertain sadly in my opinion was the opposite i was really enjoying mccarthys trademark foulmouthed banter and despite the plot hardly being anything original ie parody i felt the jokes hit almost every timehowever the longer the film went on the less jokes there seemed to be or if there were jokes they didnt seem half as funny as the first halfs offerings the film kind of moved away from comedy and went more for straight movie by that i mean the plot took over which was just about as generic as they come you have the baddie with the nuke and the doublecross and everything youd see in either a bond film or any other parodyoverall its not bad its just one of those films that i feel would have worked better as a standalone tv show where the jokes could have remained tighter throughout the whole runtime instead of seemingly running out of steam midway through diehard fans of mccarthy should probably enjoy this more than most and it was fun to see jason statham making fun of himself for a change but apart from that its a film that id rather watch on tv than actually pay full price for,comedy
2015 12 melissa mccarthy rose byrne jude law miranda hart allison janney jason statham morena baccarin peter serafinowicz will yun lee bobby cannavale hilarious highconcept action comedy with drab cia drone mccarthy a stitch beginning to end who steps forward to be in the field when a botched assist with her fellow agent law causes her guilt to unleash a heroic streak a mile wide director paul feig  who also penned the profanity laced yet hysterical screenplay  reunites with mccarthy and costar byrne as the bitchy villianness whose vulgarity is only matched by her killer fashion tastes love the do while the vehicle built steadily for its star is tailormade and a complete hoot statham has fun aping his action hero egoism by being inonthe japes and jokes with a deadly deadpan and nononsense embellishments of his feats of strength talldrinkofwater hart steals the film as the british cohort of mccarthys with a visual of mutt  jeff teaming of par excellence and serafinowicz libidinous italian colleague is a laugh riot all to himself,comedy
a deskbound cia analyst volunteers to go undercover to infiltrate the world of a deadly arms dealer and prevent diabolical global disaster is directed by paul feig and stars melissa mccarthy rose byrne jude law and jason statham this film is a pretty clich movie regarding the plot weve seen it all but i enjoyed it anyway female focus allows for a different and more knowing kind of parody surprisingly there are good action scenes as often in comedies they got the job done somehow and were all here for the jokes moreover mccarthy is extremely lovable here with a sweeter softer performance very different than what were used to from her shes a genuine force of nature there should be a hurricane named melissa shes funny and she also can be mean and angry from time to time plus theres a certain progression of her character as she gains confidence through the movie which gives her her most nuanced role to date ultimately mccarthy kicks some ass as well as jason statham who is flatout hilarious in his deadly serious chuck norris like monotone monologues  i was crying with laughter  which contrasts beautifully with her expressive energy finally you can see coming the third act pivots from miles away but intentionally so adding to the humour a series of breathlessly entertaining scenes that make you realise how rare the combination of female hero and female villain is on screen without ever making a big deal of its gender dynamics is an empowering breath of fresh air for female driven comedy overall melissa mccarthy is very funny i enjoyed the back and forth of the movie its en exciting good time,comedy
like most people i was introduced to melissa mccarthy when bridesmaids came out i laughed like crazy during that movie and then laughed even harder when i saw the heat this new movie the really delivered the goods this movie was so funny that i could not even keep from laughing this movie is about a james bond kind of guy that goes missing melissa mccarthy has to go undercover to find him there are tons of funny sayings in this movie and a lot of good humor one of my favorite parts was when mccarthy started cussing out raina that was really funny jason statham really was funny to he was always really mad and angry but he was just so good and funny the cameo by 50 cent was good to or as they called him 50 cent piecemy friend jake saw the sneak preview to this i dont know if he liked it as much as lenny and i did but we really love it way to go melissa mccarthy we need more female funny ladies like youdj,comedy
is an espionage spoof staring melissa mccarthy rose byrne jason statham jude law and so on basically is about a deskbound cia analyst melissa mccarthy that volunteers to go undercover to infiltrate the world of a deadly arms dealer rose byrne and to prevent a global disasternow if anyone was actually thinking this film was going to be amazing probably needs a reality check this melissa mccarthy driven film is to be fair at times funny but overall is a dumb comedy with melissa mccarthy spurting loud mouth foul language in order to gain a laugh when half the time it falls flat the thing that made for me is undoubtedly jason statham and peter serafinowicz who were both very very funny is this film these two men have the best lines throughout the whole movie and were consistently funny unlike melissa mccarthy and miranda harts characters as a comedy id say is defiantly a successful one especially in comparison to that catastrophe of a film tammy this is a huge step up for melissa mccarthy is definitely a watchable film like you could sit there and watch this film not hating yourself although a watchable film however certain things happen throughout the film that beg the question was that really necessary and make you think twice about whether or not that was stupid or funnylook all problems aside id say check out besides some stupid moments this movie really isnt that bad and at times is quite enjoyable i wouldnt give this film any higher than a 610 it has its moments but ultimately isnt really that clever or original of a filmthanks for reading and have yourself a wonderful day,comedy
the idea of having melissa mccarthy as an action hero would already make everyone predict that will definitely pander the comedian to be just the funny fat woman who may screw up her own mission caused by a number of outrageous antics but the approach of the actual movie turns out to be a little smarter yes its a comedy that somewhat mocks the genre especially james bond which one of the characters is basically a parody of him but aside from that its just another movie but with an odd choice of a hero its pretty silly but the movie doesnt go lazy with this idea is a little too long than it deserves and the plot doesnt get much of the focus but when it sticks to its own laughs and movie tendencies it actually worksunlike many comedies today this one doesnt go as overthetop cartoony as lets say kingsman the main plot doesnt exactly matter if you can follow it or not and the movie does acknowledge it the real story here is how the main hero doesnt seem to cut out to this job the film doesnt downgrade this character either susan cooper is actually good at being a deskbound analyst and she really takes her job seriously its just that the agency dont wholly trust her due to her physicality and behavior that she ends up being given with unimpressive identities shes clearly not that professional in the field and that also lead herself in some awkward situations but you can see that shes really trying to make things work again the film doesnt pander into obvious humor maybe sometimes but thats not the exact punchline in fact we do see the character grow into this duty that it almost seem to be an origin story and thats definitely the case its trying to make her a new action hero for a franchise but still sticking to the comedy roots of courseif the movie isnt being funny then the action movie side is still worth watching if the plot was a little careless but there is still some interesting elements in it the action scenes are actually well done and surprisingly violent regarding this as a silly comedy there are times the movie gets unexpectedly grim but it strangely helps building tension since this is still an action movie the acting really brings it to the table while many people are getting tired of seeing melissa mccarthy as the obnoxious comic relief character that her recent films have often treated her this movie manages to slightly moderate that side of the talent and establishes more of a real character out of her jason statham stays with his usual character but he finds a comedic sense to it which delightfully stole every scene that hes inkeeps things basic it doesnt need to completely make fun of the genre until it becomes totally otherworldly the real center of the movie is apparently its main character learning to fit in to this dangerous side of her job in spite of her appearance and attitude but in a naturally amusing way the plot is still overlong and forgettable but as long as you focus on the characters humor and action its quite entertaining the main concept may not sound exciting but the film just handles it pretty well,comedy
to be honest i didnt expect much from this movie the poster really put me off it but the trailer hooked me in enough for me to give it a goi was pleasantly surprised on several fronts from a comedic standpoint this movie had plenty of laugh out loud moments from unexpected jokes to cliched jokes done well enough that they were still funny to some degree i felt the movie was laughing at itself and pulled this off less astute viewers might miss this and feel that the movie is using them for the sake of trying to be clever but in my opinion that was an element of its brilliancefrom an acting point of view i felt that melissa mccarthy and miranda hart delivered the best performances of any movie that i have seen them in and felt they worked well together also notable was jessica chaffin and jason stathamas for the script i felt it moved the story along nicely a great balance of comedy action and drama well paced through out the movie this movie was beautiful to watch in hd with some lovely locations and sets which added to my overall enjoyment this is a movie i will enjoy watching again one day and would risk watching a sequel should they ever make one,comedy
susan cooper melissa mccarthy is a deskbound cia analyst with 10 years of service who has been integral in assisting cia fieldagent bradley fine jude law in completing his missions by being the voice in his ear when fine fails to complete the mission and with all other fieldagents already being compromised cooper volunteers to go out into the field to track down rayna boyanov rose byrne and prevent her from selling a nuclear weapon to a group of terroristsgiven the fact that this is intended as a spoof of films i presumed that the forerunning theme would be to send an agent out into the field who is clumsy and incompetent and yet they believe in their own mind that they are brilliant  this worked well in johnny english and get smart the problem here is that susan cooper is neither incompetent in her deskbound job and nor is she incompetent in the field this approach doesnt serve the film well and at times it feels too much like youre watching a regular film than a so called spoof of a filmanother issue i had with this film was the decision for cooper to not have a partner for large portions of the film i always feel that spoofs thrive better when there are two very different people thrown together to complete a mission  this creates a dynamic and camaraderie and having two conflicting personalities at each other throats will more often than not make a film of this nature much funnier statham plays rogue agent rick ford who is effectively the thorn in coopers side but he isnt permanently partnered with her and i found that he seemed to drift in and out of the story willynilly this is a shame as writer and director paul feig set both characters up perfectly but for some reason chose to keep them separate for the majority of the film the reason i say its a pity is that i thought stathams character was funny  his bs stories become increasingly ridiculous and exaggerated and i found it very hard not to laugh at his rather tall stories the only slight problem i had with his character is that hes only shown as being incompetent now and again rather than being totally incompetent meaning there was no real consistency with his characteras ive mentioned the biggest mistake that was made here was the decision not to have cooper and ford working as partners which is what ultimately weakened the film feig does partner cooper up with artingstall miranda hartlater in the film but hart doesnt have the amusing material that statham had to work with which meant that hart  mccarthys scenes were nowhere near as funny as statham and mccarthysthe plot is fairly generic which wouldnt be a problem if the film was actually funny but most of the funny moments were between statham and mccarthy but again they werent on screen together often enough which is why the picture was short on laughs in fact the first laugh i got from this film was when statham first showed up on screen which just goes to show that he should have been used morethe performances were all very good jude law seemed to have fun being a james bond type character melissa mccarthys energy and enthusiasm is infectious and probably makes the film more tolerable than it should be after seeing rose byrne play many nice and likable characters i was unsure how good she would be playing the super bitch but shes excellent and she looks pretty good in this film too after years of playing serious tough guy type roles it was good to see statham sending himself up and he looked like he was having fun herethe film works quite well when statham and mccarthy are sharing the screen together and i could see that they shared a quirky and rather interesting dynamic however feigs decision to not have them working together throughout the film was a big mistake the result of this miscalculated risk is a generally humourless film that is saved from the doldrums mainly thanks to great performances from the main players and jason statham who managed to generate a laugh from me in nearly every scene that he featured in,comedy
ridiculous that some give this 110 i guess everyone is entitled to their opinion it is a very funny movie very entertaining and well made probably melissa mccarthys best comedy plenty of laughs comedies are meant to be funny and this film certainly is not sure why others would rate it so poorly but really doesnt make any difference pity for them have seen this several times now in fact watching it right now with my wife stumbled upon it again while flicking through the channels on tv and it still makes us laugh a lot dont listen to the haters great movie hope they make a sequel,comedy
what begins as get smart for women swiftly becomes something much much more by the time the end credits have rolled quite possibly one of the funniest entries in the genre this is coming out in a year where there have been too many releases in the same genre and though this is supposed to be played for laughs it makes a perfect companionpiece to mathew vaughns kingsman going all the way rrated as well melissa mccarthy has definitely found her niche playing her comedic role completely straight ensuring that we not just laugh at her character but also empathize with her completely not an easy feat to pull off for anyone especially given the conventional definitions of beauty and heroism that abound all over us not to mention the mainstream movie realm that glorifies and revels in the conventional definition of beauty miranda hart is also the perfect voicetheear foil to mccarthys field agent and their chemistry evokes the numbers of years that they may have known one another been each others friends from as simple an exchange like in a bar along with the gorgeous morena baccharins character surprisingly even the onthesurface thinlywritten roles for the likes of rose byrne and bobby canavale ultimately turn out to have more meatondabones than initially surmised jude law looks weird but does a good job with what he has i thought his characterization would be the surprise package but that honor actually went to someone else jason statham playing the straightlunaticsuperstupidto melissa mccarthys wouldhave beenbumbling but is actually an antithesis to the suave superis in his element and owns every scene hes in his characterization his delivery of the lines written for him are pitchperfect and justifiably evoke maximum laughspeter serafinowicz since his intro to the end maybe especially at the end is a hoot or am ithe q scene is a hoot and q himself perfectly cast michael mcdonald absolutely fantastic in his 1 scene as he was in the hilarious web therapyone more point of note in other spoof movies with spoof being the singular objective a character like stathams would not have been included even within the writing stage it is a testament to the strong writing and stellar execution paul feig  bridesmaids the heat ghostbusters that they incorporate this and several other touches that elevate this higher than many other works in this subgenre all the technical departments support the main narrative with score cinematography setproduct design and location work along with the action choreography complementing the core of the screenplay however not all the cgi sticks and this is the same problem both get smart and feigs the heat both have though not to the extent that most of mainstream hollywoods action movies have i understand the going digital is cheaper but it doesnt have to look cheap in this movie though as in get smart or feigs the heat thats a minor nit to pick since the overall content more than makes up for itanother scene worth a mention allison janneys a great addition to any ensemble here playing the equivalent of m disdainful refrain womena whole lotta fun at the movies worth repeat viewings sit thru the endcredits for a whole lotta funny mission briefs for either the interval between sequels or hopefully more material for future sequels kinda like what 22 jump street had going for it,comedy
middleschool humor with a lot of sexual innuendos double entendres uncomfortable situations and outrageous puns but it was excellent if you cant lol at what made you lol when you were a teen then im sorry to tell you but you have grown up into a boringas adult people who are offended by excessive swear words choose to be offended maybe you prefer jokes written for five year olds good clean fun only for you stupid prudes the plot of this movie is fairly simple following cia agent susan coopers journey across europe in an attempt to stop the sale of a nuclear bomb it is a parody so of course it uses all the movie clichs the fight scenes are brutal as is most of the violence hello awesome that is what actually goes down in most movies and i appreciated that they kept that aspect of the genre there are two fight scenes in particular that had me exclaim holy f every actor seemed to hit the right notes with their timing and delivery even some of the minor characters like anton or colinfrederick i was never a fan of melissa mccarthy but she was excellent here and won me over i will definitely be looking forward to more paul feig movies although i will keep my expectations low for the new ghostbusters movie as i feel it wont live up to the original unless the plot is fresh,comedy
susan melissa mccarthy is an administrative stuck behind the desk as support for another jude law until the plot puts her into the field jason statham is her coworker who resigns his position because he doesnt think she can do the job rose byrne is great as the femme fatale who is annoyed by everything around her madness ensues its a comedy so take that into account when the movie seems unrealistic i wrote this only because of the really bad reviews i saw ive seen plenty worse movies melissa rose and jason are all pretty funny its not perfect and it could have been made much better but i liked it,comedy
id be lying if i said i was ever expecting anything from this spoof  due to a combination of its marketing the behindthelens talent and even an overall lack of enthusiasm of its pastiche prospects since most in that particular subgenre are indeed subpar id also be lying if i said i wasnt pleasantly surprised by 2015 though because while its predictable and predictably clichd in both its narrative and overall execution the feature is actually rather entertaining and even sort of endearing in its own albeit slightly neutered and kind of cringeinducing way its not particularly funny though there are some jokes that land amidst the many that dont and theres a narrative element that takes a certain character and their arc in an annoying direction one that actually goes so far in that specific direction it almost runs counter to itself but theres plenty to like here your mileage will vary though depending greatly on how empathetic you find the characters and how funny you find the humour 610,comedy
trailer looked exciting i like mccarthy but i like statham more he made the movie worth watching there are instances where you can loose your instances but mccarthy and stathams comedy chops will keep you going just bear with some of the clichs there are ups and downs the twist im sure people saw it coming but was funny none the less,comedy
its pretty difficult to perfect the art of parody the glorious comedies of the era crafted by mel brooks are long gone and i doubt that any kind of renaissance is ever going to come back any time soon clichs already have destroyed any shred of originality it probably has left pair that with one of the most despised actresses in the cinema game so far and you may have a recipe for quite the disaster what was given instead was a well rounded fun romp of a adventure that has just enough melissa mccarthy that doesnt causes a great deal of stress for those who only like her in little treats like this also jason bloody stathem steals this film by becoming the best parody of himself since his role in the expendables series really the film is not only a good parody but its just a good movie in general i may not have enjoyed tammy but i am certain that mccarthys star quality that many actors these days dont muster up this here is mccarthys best movie and id be happy if this was the last movie she does for a while and others will probably agreethe clichs that plague the film are far too easy to spot you know the superis gonna betray our heroine spoiler alert you know the hero and the villain try to make up and be friends like in the interview spoiler alert you know that jason bloody stathem is going to screw this up despite all of his badass boasts spoiler alert honestly if youre surprised about any of these spoilers then you really need to see more movies because it gets really bad with it herethat is however up until the 3rd act when becomes a truly fantastic film the plot starts to straighten and a couple plot twists are thrown in to give the movie a kind of unique spice the final twist being a pleasant surprise and the ending was making me laugh like a hyena mostly involving mccarthys character jason bloody stathem also 50 cent piece is in this film and hes actually far more tolerable than his real life counterpartyes curtis 50 cent piece jackson is actually a surprisingly funny asset to the movie at first it feels like a onetime joke but its soon revealed that he ends up aiding the good guys in the most 50 cent way imaginable solidifying to us all that the rap genre is now the most parodied thing in our cultures recent memoryits a fun movie that has a lot of bumps at the start but that road smooths out near the end and ends up with a bang a big bloody bald british bang see it if you havent yet4 stars aranking,comedy
unaccompanied minors director paul feig has been grooming plussized actress melissa mccarthy for the big time since he cast her as the loquacious scenestealing puppynapper in bridesmaids meantime when she isnt costarring in her primetime cbstv series mike and molly mccarthy has been landing bigger roles she was hilarious in identity thief with jason bateman and she held her own with superstar sandra bullock in feigs female police partner yarn the heat in those movies mccarthy proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that she had usda approved comedic chops nevertheless she has confined herself to playing second fiddle roles like those reserved for hangover star zach galifianakis indeed mccarthy amounts to a female equivalent of galifianakis although it was a stab at stardom tammy found mccarthy confining herself to a similar galifianakis role except her name appeared above the title if anybody doubted the stout stars ability to shuffle off her comedic coil and play it straight they need only observe her in the superlative bill murray arthouse comedy st vincent where she restrained herself and shined all the brighter for her discretionary efforts now in feigs sixth film mccarthy has finally arrived watching is like watching the evolution of cinematic comedy if this audacious but formulaic espionage spoof doesnt solidify mccarthys status as the first fat lady of laughter nothing will think about it has hollywood ever given a big gal a shot at superstardom she is the whole show not the sidekick or the scene stealer represents the zenith of mccarthys career as a leading lady mind you she is still a big gal but from now on she will be the big gal and everybody will be strumming second fiddle to heras fortysomething deskbound cia analyst susan cooper mccarthy toils tirelessly without recognition from a vermininfested basement in langley virginia she makes it possible for one of the top field agents bradley fine jude law of cold mountain to survive perils galore in a snappy opening shootem up sequence set in faraway bulgaria the debonair fine decked out like a dapper james bond dodges an army of gunmen while he searches for a dastardly villain who has stolen a tactical nuclear bomb cooper serves as fines liaison communicating via satellite by means of hightech surveillance equipment consisting of an earpiece and a tiny contact lens camera that fine sports susan provides him with deathdefying reconnaissance she warns him where his adversaries lurk charts evasion routes and feeds him on the spot information about anything he encounters during a mission together nobody can thwart them not surprisingly susan has an obvious crush on her attractive colleague eventually bradley confronts his chief adversary eastern european arms dealer tihomir boyanov raad rawi of traitor and threatens to shoot him refusing to reveal the whereabouts of the nuke boyanov calls bradleys bluff unfortunately for boyanov bradley suffers an attack of hay fever that makes him sneeze so that he accidentally shoots tihomir in the head later bradley renews his hunt this time he pursues boyanovs haughty daughter rayna rose byrne of bridesmaids but she gets the drop on bradley and kills him naturally susan has a ringside seat for this startling occasion and watches in disbelief as rayna murders bradleypredictably susans superior cia deputy director elaine crocker allison janney of juno finds herself in a fix because the opposition knows the identities of her surviving field agents this doesnt deter brash loudmouthed rick ford jason statham of the transporter movies from demanding that crocker assign him to the case with a different face mistakenly ford believes the cia possesses a miracle machine that enables agents to change their faces like john travolta did in the 1997 john woo extravaganza faceoff so he can save the day livid that everybody has lied to him about such a gizmo ford storms out and crocker decides reluctantly to send susan out into the field to follow rayna and locate the bomb susan is dying to play but crocker saddles her with a variety of unflattering aliases that take advantage of her frumpy figure nevertheless despite these derisive disguises susan embarks on a european outing that takes her from paris to rome and finally to budapest not only does she manage to track down the wicked rayna but she also fools her into believing she has gone rogue later she finds an elusive al qaedaoriented terrorist sergio de luca bobby cannavale of snakes on a plane who wants to blow up new york city with the nuke along the way susan runs afoul of ford he claims he is shadowing her to save her life but she winds up saving his life the best fight scene in has susan contending with an indestructible female adversary kia nargis fakhri who doesnt flinch even after our heroine shoves a knife through one of her hands susan winds up commandeering motor scooters cars jets and a helicopter to preserve civilization from the enemyundoubtedly brawny action star jason statham delivers the second best performance nothing prevents him from ridiculing his own tough guy persona with a heretofore unbelievable sense of abandon statham is shameless as mccarthys egotistical counterpart nothing in stathams cinematic resume will prepare you for his madcap antics indeed this is the farthest afield the buzzcut british actor has gone with his image especially after his wicked villainy in furious 7 as susans cia basement colleague nancy b artingstall british actress miranda hart of the call the midwife television series knows how to steal scenes too basically nobody gives a bad performance in this exhilarating action comedy furthermore writer  director paul feig doesnt pull any punches characters get their heads blown off in halos of blood and politically incorrect laughs ensue feig stages several bulletriddled shootouts and mccarthy gets to beat the stuffing out of several robust ruffians altogether qualifies as a riotous saga with mccarthy dominating the shenanigans,comedy
review i really enjoyed this movie i laughed all the way through this far fetched comedy and the mixture of top class actors gave it the shock factor the funny script and impressive action scenes were great and it was good to see the funny side of jason statham melissa mccarthy plays a desk bound cia employee susan cooper who guides her partner bradley fine jude law through his various missions and secretly has a crush on him whilst on a mission to retrieve a nuclear bomb from tihomir boyanov he accidentally kills him without getting the bombs location the only other person who might know the bombs location is boyanovs daughter rayna rose byrne so fine goes to her house to try and gather some information on his entry rayna kills him while susan is watching and she tells susan that she knows the identities of all of the agents susan then volunteers to become a field agent so she can takedown rayna and revenge fine so her boss elaine crocker allison janney agrees on her terms as long as she doesnt have any contact with rayna one of the other agents rick ford jason statham is disgusted with elaines decision to put susan in the field and he quits his job and leaves the agency susan is then sent to paris to on sergio de luca bobby cannavale and she bumps into ford who has turned rogue and has no faith in susan completing the mission the next day susan sees an assassin exchanging fords bag with a bomb so she tells ford about the exchange and then she takes chase against the assassin who she kills by pushing him off a balcony susan then follows de luca to rome and she meets her contact aldo peter serafinowicz whose and italian agent working for the same agency she then follows de luca to a casino but shes not allowed to get near him so she goes to the bar were she sees a man put drugs into raynas drink she decides to tell rayna about the drugs which saves her life so rayna recruits susan as her bodyguard they then fly to budapest were another assassin tries to kill rayna on the plane but susan saves her life again and safely lands the plane rayna is convinced that susan is a cia agent so susan tells her that her father hired her to protect her in budapest nancy artingstall miranda hart is sent to keep an eye on susan and another assassin tries to kill rayna so nancy takes rayna to safety while susan chases the assassins who turn out to be the cia double agents working for rayna later that night they go to a party were rayna is due to meet up with de lucas associate lia nargis fakhri so nancy creates a diversion so susan can stop the meeting after chasing down lia susan ends up in a fight with her in the kitchen and her life is saved by fine who faked his death so he can become raynas lover susan is then imprisoned with aldo in a bunker were fine tells her that he really faked his death so he can get to the nuclear bomb susan and aldo manage to break out of the bunker and they go to de lucas mansion were they are selling the bomb for diamonds susan poses as a double agent and when the bomb is revealed de luca kills the buyer and his men and threatens to kill rayna but ford appears which distracts de luca so susan can save raynas life again de luca then escapes with the bomb and the diamonds in a helicopter so susan takes chase and hangs on to the landing gear with ford hanging on to her nancy and aldo arrive in another helicopter and shoot de luca but he isnt dead and he hangs onto susans necklace which was given to her by fine so she unhooks the necklace and de luca falls to his death elaine then arrives to retrieve the bomb and rayna is arrested realising that she has found a friend in susan elaine then appoints susan as an agent and gives her files for her next mission the director really did spend his budget well because he was able to get some top class actors film in different countries and have some impressive action scenes whilst still making the storyline witty and air tight jude law proves that he should be a candidate to play bond and jason statham shows that he can play comedic roles so like tom cruise in tropic thunder i hope he stars in more movies in this genre anyway i really enjoyed this movie the first time round but i doubt that it will have the same affect the second time round enjoyableroundup melissa mccarthy 45 has really proved that you dont have to have the perfect body and dashing looks to become an action hero with this movie i was impressed with her fighting skills even though it was most probably a body double and her unique comedy style really worked well in this film since her big break in 2011 in bridesmaids her movies have nearly grossed a billion dollars which is quite impressive for a late bloomer anyway this movie was written and directed by paul feig 53 who also brought you bridesmaids and the heat which also starred melissa mccarthy she seems to be his lucky charm i hope they bring out a sequel to this movie with the same characters because it has a great mixture of agents who all brought something fresh to this projectbudget 65million worldwide gross 2356millioni recommend this movie to people who are into their action crime comedies starring melissa mccarthy jude law rose byrne jason statham bobby cannavale raad rawi jessica chaffin and 50 cent 710,comedy
the film is so amusing and i feel like its really worth it i spent two hours in a very pleasant way melissa mccarthy is so talented and she proves it for one more time she is unique in making everything look funny if you are a fan of her she wont disappoint you she gives what you expect from herrose byrne is really good in this film toothe film combines elements of a good film with a neat plot and a wonderful female comedian in the leading role surrounded by nice actorsit would be great to watch a sequel,comedy
cia analyst susan cooper has spent her entire career as a desk jockey working handin hand with agent bradley fine using hightech equipment and a hidden earpiece susan is the guardian angel who helps bradley avoid danger but susan yearns to be with him on these dangerous mission a true agent when bradley is assassinated by bulgarian arms dealer rayna boyanov susan wrangles her way into her first undercover assignment to help capture boyanov and avenge bradleyits third time lucky for feig and mccarthy and although she has a wonderful screen presence this could have been the same character from the heat or even bridesmaids as her profane schtick seems to be her calling cardits the support though that really make the film what it is law shows that he could have been a major contender for a certain british agent byrne excels as the spoilt villainess of the film and then there was stathamits brilliant to know that he can send him self up the way he does and quite a relief to know that all his action roles before this always had that knowing wink from him as this proves that he has a wonderful sense of humour schwarzeneggar aside could you see any other seasoned action star send themselves up the way statham does in thisas well as a successfully high ratio of jokes fired from the gag cannon feig also knows how to conduct a genuinely thrilling set piece which only benefits the rest of the filma few times during the film it did remind me of true lies a little especially the opening but if youve seen that movie thats only more of a complimentits not going to be remembered as a classic in years to come but its a fun action packed comedy that does supply you with genuine belly laughs on more than a few occasions,comedy
i can understand why someone would not find this funny it can be quite rude simplistic and a bit done in bad taste but for me and my two teenage kids we were well entertained by it some of it reminded me of the carry on movies some was the hangover the party with peter sellers style and some was the alan partridge style humour some of the acting was a bit overdone but that is the style of movie it is full of insults and physical that made us laugh out loud jason stathan in a straight comedic role that could only have been done by himi didnt expect much but was pleasantly surprised i cant see anyone in my family not liking it apart from my religious aunty but even she would laugh in places,comedy
i read a few reviews of this  the reviews i read were all negative citing dumbing down and vulgarity i dont understand whats so new about that and one person claimed to be a huge fan of melissa mccarthys im a big fan of melissa mccarthy as well i think she is supertalented but her movies at least the ones ive seen are usually dumbed down and vulgari found this one not as offensive as some others of hers ive seen and with more quality scenes at least here she didnt portray some crude slob here shes an agent susan who helps an agent in the field jude law by watching wherever he is on computer and telling him if someone is sneaking up behind him etc theyre a good team shes in love with him they seem to be friends although hes a user without giving anything away susan winds up an agent in the field when its learned that a nuclear bomb is being purchased she is only to find and report but she takes it further and winds up coming up against the vicious rayna boyanov rose byrnethe undercover outfits susan is given to wear are hilarious and the hotel she is sent to  a real hole mccarthy is good showing a little more vulnerability in this than she did in the last film i saw her in and she looks great with the rayon short curly wig and the cat tshirt off shes a very pretty woman and some of her lines are quite funnyjude law is bradley and hes swoon worthy hes slick and smooth and one can easily see a woman without a lot of man experience falling for him and his easy flirtation  done with an agenda of courserose byrne  i loved her on damages and she does a wonderful job here as the villainous rayna  cool snobby insulting and dangerous miranda hart has a great turn as nancy the woman watching susan as shes out in the field a good role for the british comedienne she and mccarthy worked well togetherthe best part and the best lines belong to jason statham who plays a hyper agent who doesnt want susan in the field and stalks her the character claims to have done preposterous things  i jumped out of a window with only a raincoat as a parachute i broke both legs i saw the woman i loved pushed out of a plane and then hit by another plane he has a habit of showing up at odd timesthere were some funny scenes and i found it entertaining what i liked is that mccarthy played a somewhat overweight pretty insecure woman who lacks confidence i hate her fat slob with a foul mouth portrayals which i find demeaning however there were plenty of foul mouths and low humor to be had but with a good cast and fun stuff in between,comedy
on face value and indeed from the trailer i had no reason to be excited about i am familiar with melissa mccartheys reputation for these fatcomedies even if ive escaped most of them and the trailer which evoked one laugh on first viewing and about 4 cringes on subsequent viewing didnt do much for me either sadly for the first twenty minutes i was proved right the writing is terrible too much time is dedicated to pink eye jokes and the fact that mccarthey is in love with jude laws character theres good comedic timing but its a rather unpleasant experience to sit throughand then at around the 2025 minute mark at a point marked by jason stathams first appearance in the movie the film takes a sharp right turn and becomes so wildly hilarious that its like paul feig shook off the halfdoze he was writing the first part of the film with and starts churning out gold is absolutely hilarious but works even better as an action film if this is paul feigs sneaky audition to the world that hes ready and willing to take on action films then lets embrace it he knows how to construct a scene all right the stunt choreography is so flawless its like watching a fast paced combat dance he can capture the fights without resorting to crummy shaky cam and the film is packed full of epic fight scenes i will put money right now that the mtv award for best fight will have the kitchen fight between mccarthey and an female assassin in its top 2 melissa mccarthey takes a while to get good stuff to work with in this film  her comedic timing is great but shes not given much to work with but when she goes undercover she starts ripping out pearlers and not holding back she channels r lee ermey from full metal jacket in the insult department and listening to her trade barbs with statham and byrne is a treat for the ears and probably dangerous for the gutjason statham is easily the best part of this movie he is so goddamn funny his comedic timing as the egotistical but inept rick ford is brilliant he could have easily been a caricature of more famous inept spies like maxwell smart but stathams serious intensity is such a perfect juxtaposition to his incompetency that its a wholly original and hilarious creation his rambling monologues about all the impossible missions hes pulled off are so funny that youre likely not going to remember more than two or three examples because you were laughing so hard during the rest of it even his little quips to himself or mccarthey are brilliant  i fcking made it didnt i he responds to a question about where he got a suit from his final line in the film was so perfect that my entire cinema exploded not a bad effort considering how few were in there i could rave all day about statham in the supporting cast miranda hart grated on me for about half of the film and then ended up being a hilarious asset to the third act peter serafinowicz was a scene stealer in so many ways his final scene boggled my mind rose byrne is suitably diabolical and sexy and while i have nothing to complain about bobby canavale and allison janney could have been better used in bigger partsthe plot takes a big left turn when cooper blows her cover on raynas private jet and then has to bluff her way into a cover story i was thoroughly impressed with how well that was handled i was actually convinced by mccartheys cover story which is impressive considering that id just spent an hour watching a complete contradiction of that story where the film became too clever was the placement of jude law and morena baccarins characters within the crime dynamic i felt that baccarin was wasted and they could have cut her and given her role to law to avoid all the circles within circles thats not to say it didnt pay off id have just preferred a simpler conclusionforget kingsman forget mad max fury road forget the entire marvel cinematic universe this is the film i want a sequel to more statham more mccarthey more it wasnt perfect but i want more,comedy
i could t stop laughing its raunchy sort of unpredictable in a predictable way and has some of the best oneliners ive seen in decades watched like 6 times,comedy
one interesting fact about the film is that it is the first film ever to use that title considering the fact that there are films called the who loved me and tinker tailor soldier it is actually quite a feat melissa mccarthy ones again teams up with director paul feig for this above average comedy about a plot that has been seen a thousand times before1 terrorist has bomb 2 stop the terrorist 3 dont let the bomb explodethe outcome and series of unfortunate events that occur after are absolutely predictable and repetitive however the execution of this predictable plot is one to commend the plot is full of moments of levity with serious fight scenes always complemented by some laughs car chases and handtohand fight scenes are violent but hilariously executed by paul feig and his team melissa mccarthys character unassuming and innocent cia analyst susan cooper also has a decent character arc through the film she stars out as a misfit in the cia and concludes as a top outfield it is fun to watch her character grow from her first kill to creating impromptu new identities as to not blow her cover jason stathams character is useless for the movie even if almost all of his dialogue is pretty hilarious he chuck norrises himself by saying that he does things that are simply impossible for normal humans he just crashes every scene like in furious 7 coincidentally and provides nothing to serve the plot except additional brawn and laughs one surprisingly solid side character is rose byrne as rayna boyanov a sexy spoiled and smart antagonist her acting and humour is absolutely spot on her blend of wickedness and charm in this movie is understated but subtly powerful the violent and raunchy humour often works in this movie which some slapstick added for good measure melissa mccarthy is charming as ever and the side cast is strong too better watch out james bond youve got competition,comedy
cant think of many films ive laughed at this much outside of the hangover genuinely a laugh comes up to replace the one you just stopped having jason statham and peter serafinowicz are hilarious stooges and all the james bond  jason bourne subreferences make this an enjoyable parody,comedy
i really enjoyed this film i thought it was funny and entertaining and the cast is also pretty good melissa mccarthy was very funny in this film i thought she was much funnier here than she was in tammy i liked the story to it was a low key story but it worked i also thought the film had very good action scenes jude law was great as a and he played a funny and likable guy and i really enjoyed his back and forth talks with melissa mccarthy jason statham was also very funny in the film and he plays a different type of character than he usually playshe actually plays a clumsy character in this film he usually plays tough characters and i thought it was refreshing to see him in a different rolerose byrne also stars in the film and i like this actress she always plays a good parti found her funny in this film as a villainthere was a funny scene on an air plane where these two men kept getting thrown into the ceiling by melissas crazy driving and the men kept falling landing on top of her and she kept getting knocked down to the floor which i thought was hilarious and i liked rose byrnes annoyed response and the look on her face when it kept happening to heri thought that was one of the funniest scenes in the moviethis film is pretty good and it was a lot of fun to watch and is one of the best films of the year in my opinion i liked that melissa mccarthy played a different type of character in this film tooshe wasnt just the funny lady that made everyone laugh she was also a cool and likable character that was smart she goes undercover and becomes a and takes on lots of different identitys which i found interestingis it original no but who cares the film was fun and thats all that matters to me i was too engrossed in all the fun action scenes to care about originality i found melissa mccarthys character quite interesting and i thought it was very amusing the way she pretended to be rose byrnes friend but really she was collecting as much information about her as possible since that was her job as a melissa has a very funny scene where she rides a moped up a ramp and yells i am so badass then she lands in wet cement that scene was so hilarious there are times when this film delivered some very good tong in cheek type humour and there were other things that i found funny toothere is another scene on a plain when someone asks rose byrne what are you doing and she says to him if you must know im playing candy crush and im up to level 79 when she said that i had to laughi know most people probably wont find that funny but i did this films best points are without a doubt the humour and the action i also thought the film was fast paced and it never got slow it just kept going and going and i was very engrossed in the storyi thought the acting was good from everyone and they all played their parts well jude law is awesome and he kicks ass and takes names and he proved that he could be an action stareven melissa mccarthy kicked some ass in this filmi thought she played a strong character jason was funny as hell and is one of the films best pointsi like jason statham he is good in every film hes in and he was really good in this filmsome of jasons speeches made me laugh my ass off one of them was you really think youre ready for the field i once used defibrillators on myself i put shards of glass in my eye ive jumped from a high rise building using only a raincoat as a parachute and broke both legs upon landing i still had to pretend i was in a cirque du soleil show ive swallowed enough microchips and sht them back out again to make a computer this arm has been ripped off completely and reattached with this arm i love melissas response i dont know that thats possible i mean medically i also found it hilarious when jason kept interrupting her and kept telling her more things that he did in his life during the threat of an assassination attempt i appeared convincingly in front of congress as barack obama jason has a totally straight face while he tells her all of this and thats what makes it so funnyits obvious that jason is lying about all this stuff but it was still funny anywayjason was a lot of fun to watch and if theres any problem i have with the film its that jason wasnt in it that much and he should have been in the film more because he was highly amusing overall this is a good filmthe humour is great the directing and writing are good and the film even had some twists toward the end that i did not see coming and i was impressed by them things happened in this film that i did not expect and it almost seemed like the people who made this film were trying to parody films because at times there were tong in cheek jokes or they referenced other films which i liked i also really liked the gadgets that were used in the film there were a lot of interesting onesthe ending was also pretty goodthis film was a good laugh go and watch it i highly recommend it,comedy
operation cleanskin was a cia covert operation that like operation argo pretended to be about making a film 20th century fox was the reallife studio that collaborated in this endeavour thus they supplied some actual footage of credits which were musically and visually of a very high standard rather like those opening credits in a bond film the film purported to be a vehicle for a comedy actress in actuality the comedy actress was cia agent mccarthy melissa mccarthy a veteran agent this was actually her first undercover role in the fieldagent mccarthy had joined the cia ten years previously seeking excitement however she functioned as tech support for field operatives and was based at langley virginia she was thus known in the trade for some obscure reason as doing the miss moneypenny mentoring role she usually partnered fieldoperative agent law jude law their penultimate operation was in varna bulgaria in which agent law was smoothshaved suave sophisticated and smartlydressed he could have easily passed for the famous british agent 007 bond james bondcuriously last year agent law was also in operation black sea in which he played the role of an unemployed submariner with a rough eastcoast scottish accent and was roughlyshaved he hired a sub to locate another sub full of goldthe last operation of agents law and mccarthy resulted in the identity of all the top cia fieldoperatives being blown this included not just agent law but also agent baccarin morena baccarin and agent statham jason stathamcia boss agent janney allison janney needed what is known as a cleanskin to go on this undercover mission agent mccarthy whilst never having being in the field before bravely volunteered for the mission those familiar with covert affairs in the era of agent walker annie walker will find that langley has changed little since that era agent janney is a demanding linemanager and supervisor but one who understood the logic of sending in the inexperienced agent the foulmouthed martialarts expert agent statham however did not he resigned from the service and was believed to have gone rogueagent mccarthy whilst never having been in the field had received full training at the farm when she had joined the cia 10 years previously so although rusty she should have had all the theoretical training necessary she was equipped with some of the latest tech devices hidden into more innocent devices and also armed with her cover story and legend she was sent to paris france for what was intended to be a short missionthe mission became more complex and agent mccarthy had to travel on to rome italy here she was met by agent serafinowicz peter serafinowicz agent mccarthys own tech support in langley was agent hart miranda hart who was a british recruit as the mission continued agent mccarthy was also required to go to budapest hungaryon the mission agent mccarthy encountered rose byrne bobby cannavale nargis fakhri and mitch silpa all of whom were highly dangerous individuals she also briefly encountered a reallife popstar called mr 50 centin evaluating the performance of agent mccarthy it should be said that this was her first operation in the field she was trained ten years previously but had not got any actual experience having said that in carchases and handtohand combat she handled herself very well she was good with her tradecraft and was exemplary in her adoption of her undercover roles and the use of her legends when needed she also showed some good improvisation skills the operation did not go perfectly smoothly however her inexperience did result in some comic momentsoverall in evaluating agent mccarthy all the other agents and the operation in general it can be viewed as a success whether agent mccarthy should be placed back in the field in another undercover role is an open question her performance here in this operation does not rule that outoverall assessment of the mission 1010,comedy
when i first heard about this comedy film i have admit despite good names in the cast i was sceptical because most of these kinds of films can be predictable in material or story lines but with good reviews i was going to give it a chance directed by paul feig bridesmaids basically unassuming deskbound cia analyst susan cooper melissa mccarthy and the unsung hero behind the agencys most dangerous missions most often guiding her partner agent bradley fine jude law but on a mission involving a suitcase nuclear bomb fine falls off the grid and ends up killed rick ford jason statham is the top agent suitable to take over the mission but susan volunteers to become a field agent as the identities of several agents have been leaked her boss elaine crocker junos allison janney agrees and ford quits in disgust susan goes undercover to on the targets who have connections to the stolen suitcase posing under a given false identity or two her best friend fellow cia analyst nancy b artingstall miranda hart becomes her occasional guide suave italian informant aldo peter serafinowicz is her contact and she is irritated that ford is also around trying to complete the mission as a rogue agent susan manages to get especially close to and gain the trust of rayna boyanov insidiouss rose byrne after saving her from an assassination attempt rayna may be have connections or be in cahoots with deadly arms dealers who will want to buy the weapon susan follows the many leads within raynas empire and ends up chasing and being chased by various assassins and double agents and nancy shows up as well but what she did not count on was the return of fine he faked his death to gain intelligence about the bombs location by becoming raynas lover in the end the true terrorists are brought out and defeated with a little help from rapper curtis 50 cent jackson rayna is arrested and crocker and ford praise susan for being a reliable agent also starring bobby cannavale as sergio de luca morena baccarin as karen walker and die another days will yun lee as timothy cress mccarthy made her name in bridesmaids and proves herself as a leading actress and movie star statham is amusing as the agent who thinks hes better than anyone law is funny as the wannabe james bond with an american accent byrne is good at playing the bratty rich bitch and hart serafinowicz and janney get their moments as well the funniest moments are mccarthy bumbling around and having bad reactions to death and the many namecalling sequences between her and byrne and the chase and guns blazing sequences are surprisingly exciting it is a most entertaining comedy action movie very good,comedy
never seen or heard of this film before and i found it hilarious in parts and a great watch,comedy
then this movie is for you melissa mccarthy is funny in this in the beginning she is the one guiding the next think you know she is the one ing jude law plays the hot guysusan is obsessed over buy is always in the friend zone something happens to him and she volunteers to on the people he was looking into jason statham plays the tough his usual character except in this all he does is cuss and make some not top mistakes he was funnyso susan uses her charm so to speak to try to find out whats going on with the missing nuclear weapon but just gets in trouble then turns into a tough cookie at the end when her cover gets blown but her training with the fbi comes into play at the end and all ends wellfinal verdict worth checking out,comedy
this is not the worst movie ever made spoiler alertmelissa mccarthys the boss is the worst movie ever made you have been warnedthe ghostbusters remake also with melissa mccarthy is in the top ten worst movies i dont dislike melissa mccarthy i thought she was great as sean spicer but someone else obviously chose the material for that snl sketch not melissa she is fine when someone steps in refuses to allow her to repetitively swear or do scatological or gross sexual jokes,comedy
i loved this movie the comedy is sharp and all the pretty faces deliver the goods in this one i hope they make a sequel,comedy
this film was almost impossible to watch constantly turning volume up to hear the vocals coupled with turning volume down due to the excessively loud action music gunshots etc etc,comedy
amusing in parts but far too often swearing is a substitute for humour about half way through i got the distinct impression that theyd written the main part for dawn french and then couldnt get her cant say id blame her for turning down a script full of the f word and excruciatingly heavyhanded sex and fart jokes shame really if theyd toned all that down they might have had a half decent film on a positive noteer some of the stunts were good,comedy
i am recommending this movie for those who are a bit tired of adam sandlers mainstream comedies of last years and want to have a good time with good actors gathered in the cast i really loved the original english sounds but for hungarians i do recommend the hungarian dub since it worked out really well with top hit voices and hungarian specific wording to maximize the fun i was really glad to see budapest in a movie where it is not berlin or someplace else but simply budapest not to mention that i think this is the first foreign movie where lake balaton appears that is the top inland summer destination for hungarians the movie is a good adventure with nice characters to follow in my opinion it worths the time to watch and probably all members of the family can find some fun in it somewhere,comedy
the latest film headlined by an increasingly unpopular melissa mccarthy the bridesmaids academy award nominee resorting to such drivel like tammy reunites mccarthy with rose byrne bridesmaids in addition to starring queen of british awkwardness miranda hart also featuring are action star jason statham and jude law the talented mr ripley with marketing making it seem like another barrel of cheap unfunny laughs at the expense of mccarthys weight my expectations were not high i was glad that my presumptions were mistakenhas mccarthy for the films majority playing against type with little swearing or loudness which ends up a welcome change as it gives her a chance to really exhibit her comedic talents which are pretty expansive in she has excellent chemistry with hart as they share their misery at not being able to compete with the confidence of beauties like morena baccarin firely the scenes with her and byrne are also notably great however the comedic standout is definitely statham in a role mocking both his own indestructible action persona and the general perception of action films spies performing impossible feats statham gets the chance to parade his talent for being funny in an unexpected and highly funny way the boasts of his supposed chuck norrislike experiences with being a everyone ive ever loved has fin been gunned down in front of me another great surprise is peter serafinowicz he of the velvet voice  i had no idea he was even in and his fantastic overitalian character is almost as funny as stathams byrne is also very effective in creating laughs with her wonderful above caring ethos causing some marvellous bitchy deadpan moments that is the most fing stupidest retarded toast i ever heard allison janney the help and law both have some great moments too finally another great thing about is the action its definitely not just a comedy with some exciting action scenes that would fit in any action film and some surprisingly bloody deathsnot that is perfect the plot is certainly nothing you havent seen before and there is still humour which is either too puerile and inane or lazy to register as funny yet for the most part its intelligent enough and has enough fun characters mccarthy more than holds her own as established agents like statham and serafinowicz screw up and she takes the role of being the badass action starit may not be on a level as a action comedy with its british counterpart kingsman the secret service also 2015 but is a fun time with enough cool action and funny moments to be an enjoyable time and an 8110,comedy
rating  out of 4this film is recommendedin brief thanks to melissa mccarthy and a talented cast this spoof is not left out in the coldgrade b everyone needs a good laugh once in a while and the new comedy does deliver a good many laughs thanks to melissa mccarthy and a cast that is willing to send up their own screen personalities well directed and cleverly written by paul feig the film immediately sets the right mood with its james bond styled movie credits even before it establishes our low self esteemed heroine one misfit named susan cooper shrewdly uses any moviegoers film knowledge of these super agent espionage thrillers to maximum effect from its opening shootout to its world globetrotting to exotic destinations of intrigue although it tends to overdo the action scenes and contrived plot to sacrifice some of its humor the basic premise works so wella loyal but invisible cooper ms mccarthy ends up ditching her desk job as agent bradley fines miss moneypenny and goes on assignment to trail a diabolical mastermind rayna boyanov rose bryne before she can sell a nuclear bomb to the highest bidder cooper takes on many disguises none of which are too flattering but her guile and quick responses with her onthejob training keep her busy even if she is constantly interrupted by an arrogant and bumbling sidekick rick ford jason stathamcredit mr feig with a ingenious gimmick it is delightful seeing the suave jude law as fine playing against character and double pleasure also seeing statham hamming up the extremes of her deluded character he assembled a solid ensemble who bring their comedic talents to the film miranda hart as susans girlpal peter serafinnowicz as a slick oversexed lothario an uncredited allison janney as her nononsense boss and bobby cannavale as the crazed criminal other actors seem underused and their characters should have been given more screen time morena baccarin zach wood michael mcdonald and bjrn gustafsson much potential wastedblame mr feig for less than deft handling of the action if the director writer would have concentrated more on the comedy and less on the espionage angle the film would have been a classic comedy to be long remembered the film seems to take a sadistic glee in its use of closeups including shootings stabbings and slowmotion blood splatter its many glorified chases and its nonstop gratuitous violence disrupts humor as the body count rises for this reason settles for being is a diverting comedy trifle that can readily be enjoyed and somewhat forgottenone conspicuous misstep is that aforementioned extreme violence which undercuts the comedy too often sending the audience one step closer to reality and two paces further back from the farce but feig knows how to set up the jokes although sometimes the gags are lame like the 50 cents cameo or missed opportunities like the littleused gadgetry add to that fact that logic defies any reality in this movie particularly coopers physical agility but logic escapes the escapades in this genre of films anyway so just sit back and revel in its sillinessbut it is the chemistry between the immeasurably likable ms mccarthy and a trio of actors law bryne and statham who improve on the already funny screenplay mccarthy has played this type of wisecracking schmo many times and she excels in her comic timing and slapstick especially strong is the banter between the overstyled bouffant baddie a wry ms bryne and the determinedtosucceed susan cooperall in all achieves its impossible mission to make one laugh and be thoroughly entertained visit my blog at wwwdearmoviegoercomany comments please contact me at jadepietrorcncom,comedy
2015 dir paul feig  cast melissa mccarthy jason statham jude law rose byrne miranda hart entertaining comedy about elevating the least amongst us to higher positions after success with bridesmaids and the heat paul feig teams up with melissa mccarthy in what can be best described as their best so far mccarthy plays susan cooper who works at a agency where she feeds information off her computer into an ear piece to assist agents on the field central plot regards a nuclear bomb that only one person can detect since the villain knows the identity of all the agents only cooper can go undetected one of the films best running jokes is the unflattering disguises cooper is subjected to mccarthy endures the physical slapstick violence with awkward perfection including a massive battle in a kitchen where she swings a mean frying pan rose byrne plays villain rayna boyanov whom cooper connects with and must protect in order to discover the whereabouts of the bomb byrne is at her best during an intense flight gone wrong jude law plays agent bradley fine who with coopers assistance makes a narrow escape after accidentally killing the father of the boyanov character cooper shows him affection that is not returned quite as she hoped jason statham is hilarious as agent rick ford a hot head who believes that cooper will screw up the mission all the while she constantly saves his ass miranda hart plays coopers ear piece contact who eventually tackles rapper 50 cent in order to cause a diversion climax is overblown to pointless levels yet mccarthy takes being a beyond the realms of normal score 8  10,comedy
mr feig a good comedy doesnt need to rely on incessant fbombs and depreciative dialogue to become one there are ways to make a script sound more natural which dont require an abuse of swear words and i say abuse not use because i understand their value they are restricted on tv for some reason but there is no need to overcompensate for that honestly and the need to show a fully erect phallus is also being european myself i cant but feel sorry for italian men i feel like the actors did the best they could to salvage the material they hard to work with dont mistake me there are some gems hidden between the limping dialogue and the movie started out very promisingly melissa shines with her own light statham proved to be funny at times and jude law delivered rose byrne did a decent job too but her interactions with the main character were just cheap are you unable to create tension between two female figures without bitchy comments i feel disappointed that this project did not live up to its potential it could have been so much better well it happened with bridesmaids too in my opinion give kristen melissa kate and leslie good material for ghostbusters for the love of big g if there is one out there mind your language and please be clever as you sometimes prove to be if you ruin this one for me the same as youve been doing with your adult comedy ill never forgive nor forget not that i can make much difference i know my place in this vast earthps whatss with the mice and the bats seriously i think i missed something,comedy
the funniest movie ever i laughed so much that i wish i had tissues to wipe the tears off my face it was funny to see jason stratham be comedic i just never think of him that way he did an excellent job acting outside of his comfort zone rose byrne and melissa mccarthy were great together they are both excellent in everything that they do the entire cast was hysterical great job to all i think the writerdirector paul feig deserves to be mentioned i laughed so often that i feel like i need to see it again so i can hear all of the funny dialog that i missed the dialog and costumes were just so entertaining my only complaint is that they didnt show bloopers during the credits there must have been a lot of good mistakes between stratham and mccarthey,comedy
apparently the users of imdb absolutely despise this movie i did not like it but i wouldnt call it a 110 movie or the worst of the year i do think its below average and not nearly as goodfunny as the critics would have you believeit begins rather promisingly as many have said but the hope soon fades the film mainly relies on verbal vulgarity for its humor i dont have a problem with vulgarity being used for humor but this movie doesnt really do anything unique with it most of the jokes are just characters insulting each other an example of a movie that does this brilliantly is whiplash in that movie whenever jk simmons character insulted someone it was hilariously done and perfectly matched the demeanor of his character but in the delivery is simply lackluster when mccarthys character insults the clothing choice of the same person for the hundredth time it makes me think that writerdirector paul feig was simply trying to pad his script with offhanded attempts at comedyjason stathams character is the one with the most potential to be the movies comedic saving grace but even he is wasted by the same tired joke about all the ridiculous unrealistic hardcore things that he has done and been through it was legitimately funny at first but these jokes just keep coming back and the movie expects you to find them hilarious each time now that i think about it this movie is nearly on the level of a million ways to die in the west as far as repeating jokes goes stathams character is also inconsistent apparently supposed to be an amazing but also making stupid rookie mistakes in parts of the story played for laughs this would be fine if he didnt also demonstrate incredible skills in other parts of the movie is he supposed to be an arrogant man who can back up his claims or an arrogant man who is all talk the movie never really decidesanother actor whose talents are wasted is peter serafinowicz the casting crew was somehow able to get him on board and they have him play a stereotypical italian womanizer corny sex jokes and all seriouslythe action scenes arent anything special but theyre not awful i agree with other imdb users in that the random slowmotion in the fight scenes is just stupid and clearly trying to replicate other action movies that do slowmotion so much better can we also talk about the scene where statham throws an explosivesrigged briefcase into a body of water the briefcase flying through the air is obviously cgi were the filmmakers so lazy that they didnt even bother to throw an actual briefcase into the water its a minor thing yes but i think it says so much about the production of the movie as well as how dedicated the crew wasthe movie also has its fair share of genre clichs and wastes good opportunities to make fun of them one great movie that was self aware and was able be part of and to make fun of the genre was kingsman the secret service that movie isnt perfect and is indeed clich in some respects but it isnt nearly on the same level as but after all this criticism i still think that the movie deserves a 410 its not a good movie but its not the terrible mess that some other users on this site say it is its certainly not 110 worthy in my opinion there are a few chuckles here and there and the movie isnt completely broken so at least it has that going for it a lot of people like it so maybe you should give it a try too,comedy
2016while her shtick is most surely wearing a little thin after such dire films as identify thief and tammy everyones favourite plus sized comedian mellissa mccarthy gets her mojo back via this impressive comedy caper that plays neatly against type and features a scene stealing jason statham who just about runs away with the whole showthe less said about s story the better as it really is almost to lame to make mention but director paul feig the man in charge of heralding in the new era of ghostbusters seems to know that with his cast delivering no one will really care that barely has enough story for a short film let alone a near 2 hour featureright down to its james bond like title credits to the room full of high tech gadgets makes its intentions known quite early but shunning the now gloomy realism of the modern day bond franchise this film is all about the laughs but it also delivers some neat action and some to be warned brutal violence that may make the weaker stomached viewers feel all types queasy throats will be dissolved hands will be threaded by kitchen knives and headshots will be made as is not afraid to mix blood with laughswhile mccarthy remains somewhat subdued through the films opening hour or so once her interplay with rose byrnes nasty villainess rayna takes centre stage the loud mouthed fast talking weve come to expect from her comes to full fruition and the film really goes up a notch but all of mccarthys hijinks aside the real star of this show is the aforementioned jason statham who has the most fun his had since the last crank exploded onto the screen and his try hard agent rick ford is someone youll be hoping gets more screen time in the near future whether rick is explaining about his many dangerous exploits im immune to 179 different types of poison or setting off on a doomed boating trip statham has a blast here and its easily one of 2015 most memorable support rolesthe stories slight and there are a large portion of jokes that fall flat but when nails its material its a hugely enjoyable ride that delivers hijinks like weve never seen before with a nice return to form turn by mccarthy who now has to work harder to make us like her and with an on fire jason statham is one of 2015s most effective comedies3  office bats out of 5,comedy
ive swallowed enough microchips and sh them back out again to make a computer you know what you are in for when you have hilarious lines like that simply breathes on mccarthys excellent comic timing peter serafinowiczs horniness boy that doesnt stop at all stathams goofiness he can do anything byrnes snobby demenaour and jude laws pizazz oooh oooh and there is obnoxious gore too is a fun ride if you wish to have some good laughs into a clichd backdrop you have often played serious things goofy in your heads when your spoof mode is on and you make fun of everything dramatic does that periodthe plot is well put but is hard to concentrate on when you put melissa in the vanguard she is a fluffy bag of awesomeness that just doesnt stop tickling you complements her superbly is miranda hart who is brilliant as her bestie and boy shes funny like every other comedy there are unforeseen cuts unserious frames that lose gravity as soon as things start to become serious the climax dies out pretty soon too there is nothing that really thrills you but the movies a hoot whos complaining go watch it,comedy
when swedish news media went all frantic about how good this movie is because it is feminist i thought they were kidding anything with a strong woman in it is usually depicted as a feminist movie here in swedenwell now i have seen it and i must say they are right it really was feministfor example the female leads said sentences like it felt good to shoot a man and he is obsolete the last sentence about a man of course now if a movie where made where a leading male character said it felt good to shoot a woman and she is obsolete then swedish media would scream for someone to be thrown in jail and preferably castrated also but when a woman says what they actually said in this movie then it is hailed as feministic and goodapart from this there were some funny jokes mostly of the fat person kind that melissa usually does but it was toooo looooong god what a long movie it would have benefited a lot from having half an hour cut out of it preferably then a feministic half hour,comedy
i joined imdb specifically to write a redeeming post for this highly entertaining sometimes vulgar sometimes over the top but dependsinducinglaughleaks womenrock mendo too actorshavingtoomuchfun movie suspend your anothermelissabeingfunnyfat girlmovie snobbery because she blew mine right out of the theatre after my friend dragged me to this my friend has cancer no longer likes seeing serious movies and so i put away my iwatchforeigncontemplativefilms persona and let my diet coke spurt out of my nose i loved so many parts of this movie melissa despite some foul and crude jokes was brilliant human super human silly touching jason stratham made me do a 180 its not a perfect movie but who needs that more than they need 2hours of giggles and enjoyment great story watch it with your older daughters or older mothers and revel in the world of female spies and villains with male side kicks,comedy
i was really surprised by i was surprised because its billed as a comedy and i actually laughed out loud and there was laughter in the theater throughout the film i cant remember the last time i went to see a new release comedy and that happened the humor in is surprisingly gentle and light hearted thats surprising because the filmmakers apparently felt it was necessary to build a violent obscene movie around jokes that a tenyearold could enjoy while watching the movie with her grandmother melissa mccarthy is famously fat and female and there is no way males are going to go see a movie starring a fat woman in the numbers box office bean counters want so the filmmakers added lots of violence and obscene language thats unfortunate i know some people who could and would enjoy this movie but theyll never see it because of the violence plot melissa mccarthy plays susan cooper a cia agent who is the voice in the earpiece of glamorous field agent bradley fine jude law fine is obviously based on james bond the joke is that every move he makes is directed by cooper sitting behind her desk at cia headquarters events conspire to get cooper out from behind her desk and in the field in glamorous european capitals she must prevent chechens from buying a nuclear bomb its a james bond style plot built around susans funny character a good number of the jokes in the movie concern melissa mccarthys weight again i didnt think id find these jokes funny but i did the butt of the joke is not mccarthy but how skinnier and prettier people treat a fat woman the butt of the joke is their stupid prejudice against fat women the cia assigns susan a series of aliases all built around her being a fat loser one is an unemployed telemarketer with ten cats susan though is really heroic and competent mccarthy is very charming and lovable you root for her and you are happy when she succeeds jason statham is hysterical in a small role he is a living combination of chuck norris  most interesting man in the world jokes jude law is a perfect standin for james bond peter serafinowicz whose distinctive last name i remember from a holocaust memoir is very funny as a stereotypical italian serafinowicz is the grandson of a war criminal alison janney is terrific this movie is good enough that ive already decided to go see the inevitable sequel ps the posters that depict mccarthy as a secondary character are misleading she is the films star just goes to show you how fearful the marketers are that no one will go to see a movie with a fat female star thats a shame mccarthy is a gem,comedy
the movie was in great quality and was funny great cast watched it with the whole family and everyone enjoyed it,comedy
melissa mccarthy never ceases to surprise with her physical comedy the storyline gets a bit shaky midway but catches back up just in time coopersmccarthy comes up with the most creative ways to insult raynabyrne which holds the movie to its funny standardsthe most surprising element in this movie is jason stathams comic role who wouldve known the movie does not fall short on funny twists till the very end moment50 cents role is redundant yet hilarious couldve focused on him to share a few more gags nevertheless he is there all the action sequences are nicely choreographed and the directors knew exactly how to use jude law so hot other characters also enjoy a fair share of spotlight a must watch for mccarthy fans,comedy
this is a very funny comedy in the genre of films im not sure if its meant to be a total farce but it is very funny the cast is comprised entirely of very seasoned actorsits would be difficult not to care about the main character played by melissa mccarthy because she is such a beautiful underdog and everyone loves an underdogthere is some coarse language in this movie there is some very brief nuditythe european locations used in the film make the film refreshing and more interestingfor me personally this film achieved excellence in the comedy genrethere is very little racial diversity in the casting they could have used some more of this,comedy
i have just returned from seeing this movie on opening night in the cinema and its the first time in years that i have been in a theater where the entire audience was laughing almost constantly from start to finish i had seen the trailers for this movie beforehand and was skeptical as to whether the full movie would live up to them i was worried all the funny bits were used for promotion of the movie which happens so often with comedies but that wasnt the case with this onethe cast were incredible together i have seen a lot of melissa mccarthys movies and lately she has had a few that were nothing special tammy identity thief which made me wonder if she had used up all of her comedic value by overplaying the same type of characters for the sake of being in a movie in this film she has showed diversity with her character and has proved that she hasnt lost her touch when it comes to comedy rose byrne miranda hart and jason statham all provided incredibly funny characters in particular byrne and mccarthys backandforth insults had everyone laughingpaul feigs script is exceptional i often find when one person writes and directs a movie it just doesnt work or the storyline ends up very onesided but feig has made a genuinely funny movie with a great story and fantastic direction i look forward to seeing more of his fantastic work in the future,comedy
what a fun matine this was it made for a cheerful afternoon we definitely found it worthwhile there is obvious and subtle humor to appreciate if youve a mind to it was good to see it on the big screen sometimes theres a long dry spell between good movies to see and we made the right choice to go to this one thankfully there are folks doing the hard work that it takes to make funny movies like this i didnt think too much about what to expect and was very pleased it had a good mix of characters and the editing wasnt choppy if you want to sit back relax and have a good time this is one to see i cant truly compare this to another movie but a favorite of mine is dr strangelove,comedy
it is a funny movie because mccarthys acting is wonderful she always give us a sorprise in all her movies she is a great comedian and knows how to entertain the viewers its strange dont watching jason staham acting in a police or action movie being a person without sympathy and here he plays a dummy role he is a surprise in the whole movie now talking about the movie i think that it is a great plan to watch in your house in a sunday green afternoon and not to spend money buyins the theater tickets even if you can get some laughs it is not better that watch the simpsons in your house but if you find the movie in the tv it worths,comedy
so i felt in need of a bit of comedic relief today to cheer me up sadly i chose to give a chance and boy did that ever prove to be a mistakethe first ten minutes are what i can only describe as excruciatingly painful to sit through the humour at this point is cringeinducing to watch and falls flat almost completely i almost gave up on it at this point since this is without a doubt the worst start to a comedy movie ive seen for decades but i stuck with it if only to see if things improved once jason statham turned upit did in fact at the point he appears he literally is the funniest person in the room after that the humour improves it still fails more often than not and relies on innumerable variations of fat person jokes toilet humour and even the hysterical laughter sarcasm to be found in looking extensively at dick pictures found on a mobile phone im not even making that up honestfor the next hour it continues in this vein with the comedy essentially amounting to haha melissa mccarthy is fat and incompetent isnt that a laugh in fact things only improve when the action starts in earnest around the halfway mark whilst the jokes and quips are frankly terrible and straight out of a seven year olds repertoire the chases pratfalls and comedic violence work much better in fact it is only the second half of the film that barely saves it from being a complete and godawful mess but to get there as i have said takes the patience of a saint and a lot of teethgrittingit also says something that in a comedy movie the funniest person on screen is an action starin the form of statham he isnt given much to work with but he has a sense of timing and presentation that is entirely in lacking in a supposed comedienne namely miranda hart her delivery is so wooden and flat she might as well be a piece of ikea furniturejude law also looks a little out of his element its as if he took the part believing it to be an actual serious movie and by the time he realised it was a comedy he felt too embarrassed to quit and just soldiered onrapper 50c makes a cameo for no real reason whatsoever and does nothing to improve the movieisnt the kind of movie you will watch more than once therere no nuances here that a second watch will reveal and honestly sitting through it a second time would be an unendurable torturegiven that paul feig wrote and directed this im going to suggest to him that he sticks to directing his similar movie the heat was much better for the lack of his writing this gives me grave concerns for the ghostbusters reboot that he is also writing and directing one can only hope that focuses more on physical comedy else it will not be goodsummary gets better as it goes along but is an exercise in endurance to get there childish humour for the most part but the physical comedy is decent other than that it just isnt very good,comedy
do yourself a favor and dont waste your time on this you want a comedy watch your favorite again,comedy
this movie has a simalar plot to ones before it but that dosent matter as there are some really funny moments there,comedy
the movies story isnt one to be thought about deeply its a comedy forced out to be set in the sub genre at most points were forced to choose from enjoying the comedy or be thrown off seeing that the genre story doesnt add up yes the story feels stupid even very stupid to see how rayna take susans explanation of being her fathers bodyguard just to shed it all off when fine reemerges the usual movie clichs really dont help the movie since they make the movie very predictable the acting overall is just another standard performance i enjoy melissa mccarthys comedies just as rayna catch her red handed as a cia operative rose byrne and jude law provided enough for their characters just to keep the side going on jason statham did well enough to keep up with the jokes,comedy
1st off i did not expect anything from this moviethe couple movies i have seen mccarthy in where kinda so so she was just not very funny nor was her acting any good but i must say i laughed at this a few timesnormally i might smile a few times or chuckle once or twice in maybe 20 out of 100 comedies now a days i might laugh once if im lucky in maybe 56 out of 100 but i think i laughed like 3 times in this one thats rather rare so for me the movie was goodit was a bit on the violent side and a lot of crude adult humor but it worked mccarthy did a fine job acting in it she did not have those lines that she is trying to pull off  make funny she owned themi also enjoyed what they did with jason s character that was unexpected for our big action hero in a moviealso it was nice to see morena baccarin our favorite space concubine firefly even if it was a small partall in all it was well made well acted but maybe a bitviolent and raunchy but it worked for me its not for the kids,comedy
believe me will be one of the most entertaining times youll have at the movies this or any year melissa mccarthy plays cia operative susan cooper susans job is to shadow via surveillance systems other cia operatives to help them accomplish their missions jude law plays her partner after an apparent horrible to one mission in particular susan goes undercover to find a baddie trying to dispose of a nuclear weapon what ensues is well one of the funniest films ive seen melissa mccarthy is absolutely a scream in her role as susan cooper her supporting cast is also great jason statham plays another cia operative who could be the baaaadest on earth what you see however is nothing close to thatsuperbly written wonderfully acted and never boring is a movie i would recommend to anyone be sure to look for the very james bondesq opening this is mccarthys best role since identity theft and bridesmaids highly recommendedrated r for violence and constant language i plan on going again,comedy
melissa mccarthy has one of the most impressive potty mouths in cinema the gloriously selfdeprecating comedienne fires off fbombs that would make samuel l jackson jealous mccarthys acerbic dialogue coupled with her innate knack for physical comedy ensures this espionage spoof is nothing short of enjoyable if not memorable the carefree plot is irrelevant and lacks the biting commentary on flicks that the superior kingsman provided yet it capably achieves its aim of propelling mccarthy from one gag to the next paul feig yet again delivers a bloated runtime see bridesmaids and the heat although generates enough laughoutloud humour in his script to largely make up for it but this film really belongs to the onsong cast with the ribtickling mccarthy receiving excellent support rose byrne nails it as the condescendingly caustic villain jude law admirably takes the mickey out of himself and jason statham  who snares the movies best moment with an uproariously macho monologue  is downright hilarious as an obnoxious agent has its share of filmic flaws and jokes that fall flat but when its funny its really funny which thanks to its marvellous cast is more often than not,comedy
this movie is a laugh out loud great time if youre into movies or just like a great comedy check this one out this is going to sound strange but this movie makes films seem more believable when youre watching james bond or whoever they always work alone and it seems outlandish this film incorporates the idea of the having a team to back him or her up i already know what youre going to say the mission impossible movies do that all the time but if you think about it they really dont the agent has help for like 5 second but does something on his own for a good long time with impossible odds anyway jason statham makes this movie his lines are hilarious i hope they make a good sequel to this sometime soon,comedy
an entertaining and surprisingly suspenseful parody s strengths outweigh its flaws the film stars melissa mccarthy as susan cooper a cia agent who works in the basement feeding information to superstar bradley fine jude law cooper has an obvious crush on fine who seems not to notice though one cant help but wonder if he is faking it when fine disappears cooper volunteers to go out into the field on her firstever mission to avenge himjude law plays one of the few serious characters in the film a clear spoof of james bond the rest of the cast is filled out with comedic talent such as nancy miranda hart coopers wacky friend rayna boynakov rose byrne a snobby nuclear armsdealers daughter and rick ford jason stratham a thickskulled and stubborn former agent who always seems to show up where he is least wantedthe humor in is best when it contains some aspect of social commentary for instance when collins receives her aliases theyre outsize stereotypes of what we think a woman of melissa mccarthys age and weight might be why would it make sense for a to run around rome in a hot pink track suit and hideous wig pretending to be a cat lady from iowa well there the films logic breaks down but its well worth the joke the sparring between cooper and rayna is similarly hilarious because of raynas elevated sense of class and arrogance compared to coopers humble american persona ford on the other hand plays the biggest stereotype of a hypermasculine action hero possible playing up the absurdity of such characterswhere falls flat for me is the excessive vulgar humor a character cant just say an fbomb one time she has to say it ten times when cooper finds obscene photos on an enemys camera we cant just see one picture we have to see ten and a video theres one character who seems to exist purely to grope cooper whenever he is onscreen sometimes you just need to know where to stopno one goes to see movies like this for the plot or action sequences though they are surprisingly well done a couple of the plot twists will probably throw you off enough to forget the film is meant to be a comedy and the action sequences are suspenseful including one that takes place in a kitchen where the characters throw vegetables at each other and hit one another with pans it sounds cartoony but in practice its not when all is said and done this is a wellmade film but one definitely needs a tolerance for vulgar humor to enjoy it,comedy
four stars out of fivemelissa mccarthy and paul feig team up for the third time following 2011s bridesmaids and 2013s the heat for this actioncomedy flick simply titled appropriately feig wrote and directed the film and mccarthy plays a cia agent in it on her first mission in the field while trying to avenge the death of her partner played by jude law the movie also costars jason statham rose byrne bobby cannavale miranda hart and allison janney its the third time byrne and cannavale a real life couple have costarred in a film together its also the second time byrne mccarthy and feig have worked together following bridesmaids i think its well made and an impressive addition to mccarthy feig and stathams resumesmccarthy plays susan cooper a cia analyst that assists her partner bradley fine law while hes in the field from a desk job at the cia usa office when fine is killed by a possible terrorist target named rayna boyanov byrne cooper asks her superior elaine crocker janney to become a field agent to stop her due to the fact that other agents like the insane rick ford statham have been compromised crocker accepts coopers proposal so susan goes to paris to avenge her partner and stop a possible nuke dealthe film is full of witty and pretty clever comedy mixed with wellexecuted action scenes much like feig and mccarthys previous movie together its not quite as good as the heat due to the lack of classic buddy film chemistry between mccarthy and sandra bullock in the previous film but mccarthy is really good in the movie and statham is a scenestealer the rest of the cast is more than adequate as well but as with bridesmaids the movie is too long at 2 hours and poorly paced it also has a lot of mean spirited bully type humor aimed at mccarthys character and her appearance still the movie is funny and actionpacked enoughwatch our movie review show movie talk at httpyoutuben95imm6vork,comedy

i gave it a 10 to try and up the overall score its prob a 9 really cast is stellar and hilarious lines oh i havent laughed so much in ages literally hysterical  well completely my type of humour anyway very sarcastic excellent film if you need a good belly laugh  who doesnt,comedy
just got to watching this funny movie it could have been better if it wasnt for the too much funny bits that the starstudded movie have melissa mccarthy is at her best in this movie she is one of those female celebrities who youd go to a movie just for her name so i dare say her name sells like a hot cake that said its the first time i see jason statham doing comedy not just statham jude law has his share of the fun too some action scenes could have been better wounds seemed fake sometimes one very good thing i like about this movie is the theme song it feels like a bond movie song i really like it is a funny movie and its way better than a lot of bullit at the box office,comedy
ive been curious about this film for the past 2 months and i half regretted when i watched itthe film itself is full of humors and maybe some dirty jokes actionpacked perhaps but i dont think so sadly i am disappointed by how the film turns out rick ford jason statham has small portion of appearance than i expected he was a interesting character yet he doesnt appeared much like hes no more than a cameo playing for a long time in my view while i feel that susan copper melissa mccarthy was too prominent she almost had whole film as her own i know that she is the main character but still too much other interesting characters become shadows becoming less noticed rayna boyanov rose byrne has a quite interesting background but sadly theres only a little to know another thing for the reason im disappointed of is the character development theres no much to see from the other characters especially their background gosh i really want to know more about other characters other than susan herself which have a quite great improvementoverall i enjoyed this film and laughed so hard at the jokes and some silly scene highly recommended for those who need some hilarious packed with funny action scene film to watch ps  for me i think this film need parental guidance since there are some scenes that are unsuitable for children under age 17 or so to watch since some scenes are explicit and some inappropriate scenes more like this film is more suit for adults ,comedy
i have seen all of melissa mccarthys comedies and always thought they were more corny then funny i am the type who wants a realistic funny comedy like dumb and dumbermy mother wanted to see it and drug me along i was pleasantly surprised much more funnier lines than her previous movies melissa nails her character and the others characters are hilarious too it gets a little corny at the end but overall it wasnt bad the woman villain is really funny too she has some funny lines and is a good actress jude law still has his good looks he plays a good charismatic jerk who will never date melissas character the movie is worth watching if you are looking to get a laugh if you are a tough critic of comedies then wait for the dvd,comedy
this review is taking on water fasti might as well sink it completely allow me to preface this review with stuffyou knowi want to share my negativities first i am not really a fan of melissa mccarthy nor am i huge fan of jude law second paul feig is far from my favorite director and third jason statham seems so notright for this movie with all this working against the production i actually had to work very hard not to like so now that i laid out my crowi now must eat the stupid bird oh  and that also ends my prefacemr feig did a pretty good job writing and directing a fast paced and enjoyable actionadventurecomedy this movie kept my attention from beginning to end other than a couple of choice  unfunny comedic moments mccarthy held it together and was funny and interesting shockingly i assumed this product would end up being an extension of the movie heat packed full of pointless obscenities and toilet humor if that had been the casei would have left two minutes into it granted  profanity was present  but there had to be some since toilet humor tends to be melissas most venerable and recognizable characteristic i feel mccarthy did a good job this timelets see what do i not like about jude law nothing really i dont think he is one of the greatest actors ever to live nor do i think he is one of the worst i just have not seen enough of him to have a strong opinion one way or the other i did like his character in this movie though he definitely had that james bond thing down to a t very cool performance  i think the proper descriptive words for his performance are suave and debonair  or shaken  not stirred anyways the guy is a natural english superso where is the real comedy hmmmmjason statham maybe in my opinion the man carried the entire show the movie might have belonged to the pair above but statham kept it from failing once jason started jabbering i could not stop laughing his comedic timing was perfect i actually work with people who are the same sort of experts as overthetop his character appears in some cases it is spoton superrick ford was responsible for all the big laughs and successoverall this is not a bad movie  the positive side of mediocre  but i had to rate it 1010 to get the most thumbs down  ever if you have kids i think there is enough profanity i would keep them away if you strongly judge movies on feasibility  this is definitely not for you  stay away if you do not like melissa mccarthy  i would give this a try rent it  and if you dont like it  the loss is not crippling it is not for everyone but i had a blast not the best flick out there  but a good time killer,comedy
i just want to write this review to warn people this film is not family friendly at all in one part of the film there are many pictures of a man masturbating with a full on erect penis closeups uncensored its full on hardcore pornography in the middle of the film i didnt even know it would be legal to be in the film but apparently it is its intended as a shocking joke but the problem is not everyone who sees this shock would want to see it so if you dont want to see this kind of thing then you will have to avoid this film otherwise there were some funny parts to the film and some boring parts mostly it was jason stathams character which was funny,comedy
the numerous effective parts of are brilliant the cast is excellent particularly jason stratham and jude law production values are superb with a refreshing absence of steadicam shots that arent steady wardrobe music makeup action choreography editing etc are all excellent much of the film is hilarious the action scenes are tense and exciting with a comic flair the film has what seems intended to be a strong feminist female empowerment theme but it is handled in such a heavyhanded manner that it detracts from the plot mccarthys susan cooper is a misandrist working in a community of misogynists while stathams ford may seem sexist when he suggests she stay in a supporting role he is also expressing legitimate concerns about her physical fitness and lack of experience his reservations are specific to cooper not a universal aversion to any woman working in a traditionally male role while he doesnt mince words he is polite and respectful and he offers numerous reasons why he believes he is better qualified than not only cooper but any other ordinary human coopers sexist comments are crude and vulgar saying such things as im the person thats gonna cut your dick off and glue it to your forehead so you look like a limpdick unicorn she is disdainful of all men and all attractive women the film presents men as disposable playthings rayna quickly dispatches henchmen over minor failings with the dispassion of dr evil the predominantly female support team are the true brains behind the testosterone driven field agents not only alerting them to unseen dangers but recommending tactics and providing their knowledge judgment and wisdom the operations manager is a capable empowered woman who is subconsciously misogynistic herself and unwilling to empower other capable women she supervises miranda harts nancy is basically the same character as cooper but tall and ungainly instead of short and corpulent at the conclusion many of the misogynists acknowledge coopers capabilities but cooper doesnt reject her sexist sentiments presumably so the character can transition unchanged into a sequelwhile is an excellent film in many respects it allows its political message to detract from the story without providing a compelling political statement its much more effective when presented subtly as when aldo appears in the denouement and suggests that appearances can be deceiving while mccarthy is the protagonist statham and law steal the show stratham is hilarious,comedy
melissa mccarthy is sensational as susan cooper and her many other identities rose byrne is hilariously dry and miranda hart is exceptional overall a hilarious film without a dull moment a must see filmundercover movies have been done countless times but they have never been this much fun one of the reasons is that it packs many surprises as much as the jokes the casts are all around wonderful and of course all of this wouldnt work without mccarthys presence she threw everything on the table i hopepeople that didnt like tammy or identity thief will give it a tryhighly entertaining,comedy
we got advance tickets to a screener it was surprisingly funny my husband laughed more than i did but the humor was mostly decent some very low brow stuff like bridesmaids but a few quotable lines jude laws accent was a bit odd but all the principals turned in solid performances it may have been written as a spoof on james bond but it comes off better as a riff on american movies ala mission impossible and the bourne series the better bond spoof of the year definitely goes to kingsmen it had some interesting plot twists and turns to keep you following and i didnt see the main twist from a mile away as i tend to so that was nice the supporting cast at the cia were especially great and i probably laughed at those bits the most,comedy
when i first saw the poster for this movie i thought it was going to be a classical comedy  but the truth is its way more than thatthe story itself is full of action as well as some tight and suspense moments it has a good build up and a few amazing turnarounds so you are never completely sure what is going to happen the actors did a decent job i think they lived up to their role,comedy
my husband and i loved this movie melissa mccarthy is hysterically funny and the stunts were overthetop it was a combination of serious action and almost slapstick comedy i laughed so hard i cried the story had plenty of surprises and never lagged we enjoyed the performances of all the actors the banter between the characters kept me on my toes i hope this is the beginning of a series because mccarthy can certainly carry it off also it was so nice to see allison janney again  hope she stays with the future series as well be sure to remain for the credits and watch the whole screen carefully to catch what is shown i rarely see movies a second time but i just might see this one again,comedy
mrs shullivan and i are huge fans of melissa mccarthys physical comedy in mike and molly and we just adored her in the earlier 20002007 television series the gilmore girls this feature film has a super opening scene tantalizing the audience that we just may be in line for a blockbuster spoof of the james bond films the opening musical score was awesome and it looked like the film was off to a great startmelissa mccarthy plays susan cooper who is the telecommunication officer assigned to assist special agent bradley fine played to perfection by the handsome and swashbuckling international fbi agentjude law but as ms cooper likes to point out to her fbi boss elaine crocker played by allison janney ms cooper is technically an fbi field agent having come first in her graduating class the plot is simple enough a war head atom bomb was unfortunately stolen by industrialist millionaire tihomir boyanov and when he is accidentally killed by agent bradley fine the bombs location is undetermined only through the intelligence gathering of the fbis office telecommunication officer susan cooper does the agency realize that the atom bomb is in the hands of the dead industrialists daughter rayna boyanov played by the classy sexy and smart rose byrneas rayna boyanov knows the fbi agents who have previously worked in the field the agency decides to allow susan cooper to go to paris france and find the atom bomb herself one agent though agent rick ford played by action star jason statham follows susan cooper to paris because in his own mind he is even better than james bond in the field and he believes the clumsy office technician susan cooper is just not up to the task of saving the world on her ownwow the films first 30 minutes gave mrs shullivan and i some anticipation of what was to follow the film was off to a fantastic start with some great comedy action and a simple enough plot the fbi agents needed to find that atom bomb before the usa suffered a catastrophe in the hands of the evil doers now led by the sexy rayna boyanov unfortunately the rest of the film was one silly action stunt after another and rarely was the camera lens not focused on melissa mccarthy as stated earlier mrs shullivan and i are huge fans of ms mccarthys comedic talents and she is a truly wholesome and beautiful woman to look at with a never ending array of facial expressions that just make an audience laugh uncontrollablyi believe writerdirector paul feig over utilized his star actress melissa mccarthy in every single scene and the films intent on a james bond spoof comedy would have been more enjoyable with a bit more balance of the supporting cast carrying some of the comedy as well the cast was top notch and ms mccarthy i cannot say enough about her she is a terrific comedic actress my only complaint was that mrs shullivan and i found the movie started to drag on with agent susan cooper continually saving the day as she fumbled her way through one action scene after the next we watched the directors version of the film and not the theatrical release version if you are not fond of hearing a barrage of cuss words and specifically that little four letter word that starts with the letter f and rhymes with the word luck then you may want to stick to the theatrical version we found the cuss words were also over extended as was ms mccarthys star poweroverall it is worth a watch for the great 30 minute start to this james bond spoof and if you feel a desire to fall asleep dont say i did not warn you mrs shullivan and i would ask that ms mccarthy try and retain more control over the final cut of her future films if i use an analogy related to food any good restaurant cannot survive on just one great dinner because consumers will get tired of the same taste in their mouth very quickly even if that one meal is a great onei give the a 5 out of 10 rating sorry melissa we hope your next film will be more balanced than this performance was,comedy
i can totally understand why melissa mccarthy may be an acquired taste that many people never develop but i liked her in this and thought the film was pretty good landing more laughs than it fumbles mccarthy is joined by jude law very good rose byrne less successful and jason statham who refreshingly gets to flex his comedic muscles for a change playing a parody of himself but the standout for me was the one actor who id never seen before miranda hart as mccarthys nerdy and illequipped righthand woman paul feig who directed mccarthy to her oscar nomination in bridesmaids does directing honors here as wellgrade a,comedy
surprisingly very goodi really was not expecting to like this due to a hatred of melissa mccarthy but this movie really workedlike johnny english its a spoof flick and like johnny english it looked good and was funny throughout thanks to the castthere was some really poor chemistry and jude laws accent was questionable but more importantly there was some great chemistry like that between mccarthy and byrne which was hilarious  cant believe ive said that but it really wasits by no means a directorial masterpiece or anything like that but its very entertainingwell done,comedy
i havent seen many of melissa mccarthys recent movies because i found the couple i had seen to be disappointing they were comedies she was in them they seemed to have the same plot overweight unattractive woman surprises everyone by her chutzpah etci did enjoy this movie the first new light comedy id seen in a long time i mostly watch older moviesi felt miss mccarthys role could have been played by any competent actress most of her scenes involved action which were done by stunt people so it didnt matter that it was her again this was a case of trying to cash in on her popularity as an overweight comedienne she has lost weight recently and looks very nice wonder how that will affect her careershe played the sookie st james character so well on gilmore girls i dont want to give the idea that i dislike her i dont i just think shes riding a wave of popularity and i wish she had better material to work with to show her stuffbut having said that i must say what really sells the movie and holds it up is the supporting cast brilliant choice of casting every actor was great and believable and made the movie entertaining i looked ever one up on imdb to learn if id seen them previously and to learn or relearn their names jason statham was gorgeous as always and quite funny throughout i have heard this might become a franchise and i would certainly watch a second just to see this castmy recommendation would be to watch it for pure entertainment and an enjoyable couple of hours,comedy
popcorn comedies are not usually my favorite movie genre but this was a big step above the rest my position for such a high rating is for the blockbuster comedy genre only melissa mccarthy is generally hilarious in her roles and this was no exception she openly embraces her full figure and has no problem making light of it in her films the stereotypes around plus size midaged single women are alive and then shot down by mccarthy no pun intended alist supporting actors do their part in sharing the laughs i do not think the movie would have been as enjoyable if only set in the us the european landscape stepped up the class of this comedy melissa mccarthy as a desk cia agent turned super cia field agent relax and enjoy the ride,comedy
susan cooper is the woman behind the great spies she controls their every move and points out how to move in the field but when her partner is killed susan goes out herself to revenged him so some parts of the film were over exaggerating like the fact that the protagonist was so lethal even though she seemed not to be i am not saying that she couldnt possible use her gun as she did but the fighting scenes were clearly impossible the story is not very original with susan being smitten with her partner going out to revenged him finds her true self eventually everyone applauds even the villains in this case and some of the jokes werent that good not to mention the guy from eurovision singing his one and only hit for no obvious reason though the performances were good and the movie itself somehow makes it to become very entertaining and so i give a 6 out of 10,comedy
rose byrne is listed first in the cast but this is really melissa mccarthys movie just saw a sneak preview of it hilarious not sure which was better melissa mccarthy playing an action hero or jason stratham doing comedy summary melissa mccarthy is a back office cia agent providing intel for an agent in the field a mission goes wrong and it appears the bad guy knows the names and descriptions of all the field agents so while the agency is trying to figure out who they can send to shadow the baddie melissa volunteers to go since no one has ever seen her or even know her name after that the comedy really begins with stratham getting in the way double agents and even a surprise one excellent performances by everyone in it the whole theater was in laughter most of the time has to be r rated for the language in it other than that nothing obnoxious in it very good movie,comedy
a very pleasant surprise watching this movie that i hadnt heard much about beforehand but this is the best comedy action movie ive seen in a long while the cover photo almost put me off looking as if it represents an atypical silly spoof 80s style us comedy im not a one who like mush us comedy movies  top marks all round action scenes the wellacted characters are easy to engage with storyline although stretched has an old style bond kind of narrative to it and the comedy is top notch statham is brilliant in his portrait of the overzealous almost gone bad its never going to tax the mind or engage on subliminal levels but its a good old romp that ill watch again watch and enjoy hope theres a second one in the not too distant future,comedy
this movie really surprised me i got some snacks and got settled in to be mildly entertained by what i thought was going to be a standard notsofunny action comedy but low and behold i almost inhaled half a dozen skittles throughout plenty of actual laugh out loud moments which is rare these days it was a little like what happened with night at the museum 2 went in expecting meh and came out the other side with a hilarity headache worth the watch and best done so with a few friends and some decently sized hard to inhale snacks the casting is brilliant and having a mix of american and british humour really made this film for me if youre expecting a serious action movie then dont bother but if youre looking for a decent way to spend a couple of hours then this is right on the money,comedy
my wife and i have come to enjoy melissa mccarthy over the years she is funny and has great timing jude law and jason statham make this an allstar cast the r rating comes from the excessive use of the f word this is unfortunate because the movie may have done better at the boxoffice with a pg13 rating drawing from a wider audiencethere is also some violence that contributes to the r ratingthe ultimate question for any movie i see is is it entertaining in this case i can yes it wasi decided to see the movie when i noticed how much money it had made i knew that other people were enjoying it tooi was also surprised by the number of people at the showing it has been out now for several weeks but is still drawing an audience locallythe audience was interactive too laughing and clapping during the movie which made it even more entertaining,comedy
this movie is real funny the type of hilarious rated r fun fest i would expect from the people who brought me bridesmaids i think melissa mccarthy is hysterical hands downfollowing up her action comedy the heat mccarthy plays an operative for the cia in her first field assignment melissa just lights up the screen everyone was funnier because she was in it she had great bits of comedy with everyone in the movievery impressed with jason stathams attempt at comedy its hard to tell weather he was trying to hard to be funny or purposely hamming it up to make his character over the top but ill lean towards the latter cause the results had me dying with laughter as we parodies his own tough guy action hero persona to the level of cartoon buffoonery statham and mccarty together were like a classic sitcom as statham plays another cia agent who thinks hes so much better than mccartys susan cooper that he cant see his own faults the action was pretty outrageous the fight scenes and car chases were just big enough to complement all the comedy which was the movies main focus keeping us laughingworth seeing its nonstop laughter,comedy
not very funny very common jokes for kids some ok parody not a good movie,comedy
after last summers criticspanned squib tammy which is not quite a financial disaster but melissa mccarthys star power has inevitably been questioned whether her boxoffice draw can still maintain after her rotund figure and comedic shticks have been overly cashed in on these years thanks heaven has arrived a third collaboration with paul feig and unites her with the criminally underappreciated her bridesmaids 2011 costar rose byrne and under feigs helm together they concoct up a thoroughly hilarious spinoff of james bonds trademark with an overhaul of a female lead and in passing finally fulfills jude laws yearning as a suitedup top agent after he lost the battle to daniel craig almost 10 years ago and gives jason statham a rare opportunity to tease his own action hero stereotype 2015 might be redeemed as a great year for the sexism hollywood finally decide to do something about its biased sense of worth after the equaldemand in patricia arquettes oscar acceptance speech and its consequent waves from various upholders we are gladly witnessing a certain change in the studio outputs especially in blockbusters where female roles are given more leeway and even challenge the usual maleexclusive formula as in mad max fury road 2015 comes headily with a suckerpunch to another male dominant genre and more daringly it puts ms mcarthy a talented woman defies the conventional boundaries of objectifying woman through mans pointofview in the leading lady chair without making offensive jokes on her appearance instead susan cooper mccarthy a selfeffacing desk operator proves to best cias top agents to complete a dangerous mission of an illegal nuclear weaponry trade the main reason spurring susan to work in the field is not the usual patriotism but the unrequited love for her offthegrid partner bradley fine law yet when the mission is accomplished and fine is impressed by her heroism and invites her for a romantic dinner she kindly refuses my interpretation is that she doesnt want to ruin the picture of her mr perfect since we are know things we cannot get is always the best instead in the next scene she sleeps with rick ford statham the bigoted agent who constantly quarrels with her dismisses her just because she is a woman and boosts himself for fabricated gallantry leaving the dream guy in your imagination and hopping on to a more approachable but recalcitrant target that is the attitude can solve all the mawkish tragedy in gone with the wind 1939paul feig writes the script all by himself and empowers womens roles in an allout fashion byrne is a heartless villainess a pampered daughter with wealth cynical about everyone around her but strikes up an unusual bond with the undercover agent cooper byrne astounds with her sublime sneer and bitchiness the british comedienne miranda hart is nancy susans best friend and college their friendship weigh a lot in the film besides the duos ribtickling comic bent mccarthy puts a demanding effort to excel all the action pieces she is a markswoman who can engage in physical combat command a helicopter even steer a nosediving plane that is too farfetched since it is only her first mission and never retreat to be a wallflower it is refreshing and encouraging to watch such a funny movie without getting offensive simultaneously by hollywoods usual crassness and vulgarity way to go the feigmccarthy pair im looking forward to their ghostbusters revamp next year,comedy
a winning parody of the genre has some effective oneliners and put downs as well an improvement in melissa mccarthys filmography with a heroine susan cooper not relying on her girth to get mirth writerdirector paul feig has a successful relationship with his star from bridesmaids and the heat more so now that her characters cia desk job turns into field agent and she kicks butt with mouth and feetthe usual tropes of films like the bond series are here coopers unrequited love for 007like bradley fine jude law just as moneypenny had for bond a gizmo factory for agents double crosses clichd european destinations like paris and rome helicopters diamonds etc the audience will not miss the references but will also not be terribly edified by how obvious they are and law is pretty enough but misses connerys subtletyhowever when mccarthy and bad boy cia agent rick ford an effectively vacuous jason statham get into verbal sparring youll think youve crossed over into the set of a screwball comedy well not that good especially because of s reliance on the f word to carry the humor the script would be far better if not for that word and if feig had tightened the loose plot linecoopers archenemy rayna boyanov rose byrne from bridesmaids is every bit a bond bad babe uncommonly beautiful duplicitous and conscienceless for instance when she calls out coops tastelessness abortion of a dress she becomes a convenient foil to coopers endearing innocence terrorists are amusing especially rakish bobby cannavale who dons the debonair as easily as he does his bluecollar bigots look out for guardian of the galaxys peter serafinowicz as an overthe top italian agent annoying but inventive in his adoration of cooperall this is to say is an entertaining spoof exposing the considerable comedic talent of ms mccarthy as the audience slowly forgets the fat on which she built her persona femmes star commandingly in pitch perfect 2 and trainwreck so far this summer distaff divas appear to be here to stay and mccarthy may be the queen of the crew,comedy
in the late 1930s through early 1940s 3840 to be precise there was a barrage of slick comedies characterized by witty cheeky rapidfire dialogues between characters without so much as a breath between jokes let alone hold for audience reaction to me the pinnacle of this achievement was the pairing of katherine hepburn and cary grant both fasttalking sultans of sarcasm in films like bringing up baby holiday and the philadelphia story here nearly a century later we revisit that style but ramped up on crack to the point where after seeing the movie i had to google the script to see what i missed while laughing my arse offand laughing it off all over againlet me give you an example the following exchange between ford jason statham and susan melissa mccarthy is crammed into the space of probably 10 seconds at most with jason firing off his lines like a chicago gangster with a cockney accent and melissa quietly interjecting unnoticed barely giving him time to reload before his next strafingford you really think youre ready for the field i once used defibrillators on myself i put shards of glass in my fn eye ive jumped from a highrise building using only a raincoat as a parachute and broke both legs upon landing i still had to pretend i was in a fing cirque du soleil show ive swallowed enough microchips and s them back out again to make a computer this arm has been ripped off completely and reattached with this fing armsusan i dont know that thats possible i mean medicallyford during the threat of an assassination attempt i appeared convincingly in front of congress as barack obamasusan in blackface thats not appropriateford i watched the woman i love get tossed from a plane and hit by another plane midair i drove a car off a freeway on top of a train while it was on fire not the car i was on firesusan jesus youre intensei dont think i need to say much more in my review if you like that style of banter not so much banter as jackhammer comedy dont miss written and directed by paul feig who brought us many episodes of the office before his big screen breakthrough bridesmades and worthy followup the heat here in we get the third of his brilliant comedies starring the incomparable melissa mccarthy in this case the script is amped up the most of all with so many hilarious lines that you really have to check out the imdb quotes section afterwards to see what you missed then watch it againthe plot who cares something about spies and nukes and hot bulgarian villains played by rose byrne who really channels her inner cruella deville only without the dog skin furs instead opting to dress as one character points out like a slutty dolphin trainerif its possible every character steals the show from melissa obviousy down to the bit part of the villains blonde male henchman who has only 6 lines and whom melissa taunts i dont see a man i see a reject from the sound of musicso watch this movie while you can i dont know if witty snappy scriptdriven comedies like this will follow but id love to see in the same way hepburngrant defined the comedic style of the 1940s or in the same way the zuckerabrahamzucker team defined comedy of the 1980s airplane top secret here another 40 years later we get a smart stylish characteristic brand of comedy that i think our generation can be proud to laugh hysterically to,comedy
humor was predictable most of the times but timing and delivery was great all characters over the top but damn that cast they nailed it,comedy
melissa mccarthy is my favorite comedy actress alongside julia louisdreyfus and im in for everything she does no matter what but is in another level because it was my most hyped comedy this year and my expectations were very high just like when the heat came out and i just loved it and i have a strong feeling this is going to be my favorite comedy of the year this is that good the film not only is super original but it is one of the better conceived comedies of all time paul feig and melissa have now become the strongest pair in comedy and they deliver and deliver and continue to deliver throughout the entire film and one of my most important things to love a comedy is being as funny in the first minute as in the second the third and so on until the last one and this film will make you laugh all the time and i really mean laugh like your belly is hurting melissa delivers her biggest character yet and also performance and she further proves how brilliant she is there isnt no one like her she could be in a terrible movie and make you laughbut she doesnt only make you laugh she also shows brilliant vulnerability to make a better than perfect character the script is as solid as oak and while of course she is the biggest star by far she is accompanied by brilliant performances and characters the biggest one next to her being rose byrne which delivers an incredible performance as one of the biggest villains of all time she is just scene stealing but jason statham is also amazing and his character delivers many unforgettable scenes and jude law and miranda hart also deliver great performances and laughsone of the things i liked more was how fresh original creative the humor is is different from everything you ever saw downright brilliant i wont spoil nothing but the story is just perfect and deconstructs the stereotypes we are used to to deliver a twisted story which shows how we should have a lot more films centered on female characters tall short fat skin white black or whatever that are this brilliant crafted we need more if this so people can realize that the better things are on going against the rules society created on what you should or shouldnt do or be there are a lot unforgettable scenes including many action scenes that are better choreographed and crafted that most of the action scenes in many action films but my favorite one has to be the fight in the kitchen i cant say more for spoilers sakethis is not only one of the best comedies of all time but a brilliant crafted film with perfect storytelling brilliant performances in particular of course melissa m that delivers her better character and performance yet showcasing once more that she is the reason for her films being so great tridimensional characters many many many surprises and overall is a film that not only wants to make you laugh all the time until your belly hurts but one that wants to be more that goes beyond what you expect that goes for the new and fresh rather than being just lazy and whats been done tons of times a film that has a lot to say and you should listenthis will go down has a tipping point and i cant wait for melissa mccarthys next film also will definitely be a huge franchise so we wont stay long without the next one is announced just perfect watch it as many times as you can because its impossible for you not to love it,comedy
this movie is truly flawless again and again it sets up expectations and then wham  takes us on a different twist often with just spectacular results the entire audience was laughing out loud regularly some of us and i include myself actually snorted with laughter congratulations to everyone who wrote directed acted and filmed this piece it was a total pleasure to watch and we may well head back to see it again in the theater  its just that goodi can only hope that they are planning to make a sequel that will equal the original for its creativity polish and amazing combination of action comedy and entertainment thank you for this movie,comedy
let me start by saying the movie wasnt terrible but it wasnt great i was able to make it to the end but was left scratching my headmelissa mccarthys character is the nice wellmannered relative that comes over during the holidays she has a very innocent vibe to her then in the middle of the film she turns into a foul mouth bodyguardbullyi was under the impression that she was doing it for her cover but even when her cover is blown she keeps it up even to the end of the filmits as if the writer halfway said fck itthis is a movie that you watch once and let it collect dust,comedy
alert contains 1 or 2 spoilers but mostly just opinionwow theres a lot of negative feedback on this movie i hit next like 6 times before finding anything positive but hey oh different strokes for different folks a few have mentioned fat jokes or jokes at the expense of the stars weight i dont think i can recall one single fat joke could be wrong at most theres the reoccurring joke that her cover identities are all like frumpy cat women which is typical of the average woman regardless of weight true lies natasha no no doris comes to mindif anything it was refreshing to see a character who is physically average kicking butt the scene with the footage from the farm was funny i even hit rewind a few times the language from mccarthy was much more tame than usual and sorry but i laughed out loud at the thunder ct line the vomit not on him not on him hilarious and i loved seeing maccarthy dressed up nice why notyes during the action sequences you saw her shoes clearly switching from heels to flats to wedgies back to heels very sloppy but actually i didnt mind if anything it allowed me to have that geek moment of noticing the flaws however blatant wont change the world did you expect it to but speaking on behalf of at least some portion of the overweight female viewing world its like fat fantasy porn a guilty pleasure if you will men have been doing it with bond for years in my opinion bond is only credible in the daniel craig years but thats another story so two thumbs up for us fatties where else do you see the average female turning it around with her unrequited love only to say see ya and ends up in bed with jason statham a fact she is not happy about also im not a fan of statham but at least hes trying something differenti agree with someones comment that the first 15 minutes show how it could have been taken in a totally different direction cooler no doubt and yes id have been totally up for that but feeling disappointed by a movie is nothing new really is it theres enough crud in this world for me to say if they made a sequel id totally see it di didnt get offended by the dk pic at all but if you did then avoid the brothers grimsby at all costs now i did think that was crudely unfunny and a lot of the this is so crude and unfunny comments allotted to you can apply to grimsby i think the majority of chunky women will have a special place for this movie and theres enough of them in the world and this is rarely shown in film on that merit alone i could have given it a 10 in fact i think the average female if not male should probably relate to the content regardless of being fat or thin the fact that shes overweight just really cements the averagejoe angle the most unbelievable bit was running to the top of spiral staircase lol there was no way i was buying that i am a fan of this type of movie actionand so i see where some may be disappointed but you can always have kingsman on standby,comedy
my husband and i got a few laughs out of this and generally enjoyed it surprising since there are so many terrible reviews on imdb i only read them after i had already rented it and i was expecting a terrible vulgar movie full of male organs and fwords the organ was shown in one scene and it was very quick and pretty funny f words are everywhere nowadays used as common language unfortunately so maybe i am jaded about organs and f words but neither bothered me in this movie not sure what other people expected given the r ratingmy expectation for most comedies and horror movies are pretty low though if a comedy makes me laugh out loud more than twice and smile through most of it i call it decent this did,comedy
thank god finally a funny comedy released in 2015is the perfect middle ground of the crazy antics we expect from melissa mccarthy thanks to bridesmaids but in a completely toned down and palatable kind of waya homely desk bound techy named susan cooper melissa mccarthy is the eyes ears and brains for cia special agent bradley fine jude law whom she also happens to be smitten with when the identities of operatives are compromised and a nuke is on the market about to bought by a dangerous bidder cooper is taken from the desk and put on the fieldin reality the success of must be attributed to its writer director and brain behind the film paul feig and to the brains behind the casting of this film who could not be more perfect for the roles they playthe tone of is quite unique not quite satire as much as zany happenings thrown into a caper plot it is the perfect blend of parodied humor rooted in a clear knowledge of the espionage genre the jokes are unexpected and vibrant utilizing the physical humor of mccarthy and the unexpected comedy of its other stars jason statham rose byrne and jude lawfeig must have a magic talent at direction because at no point does feel to be too much a common complaint we have for recent comedies released for the mass public grossout jokes and overly long punch lines are in scarce supply instead is fast and banter orientedwe had incredibly low expectations for the film and long jumped off the melissa mccarthy bandwagon which is why we cant stress our pleasant surprise enough perhaps the secret is the hilarious miranda hart who should become her full time counterpart in all future filmsplease check our website for full reviews of all the recent releases,comedy
the movie is rated r for a reason folks do not take the kiddies the casting was perfect and the comedy was crass but a fun albeit bloody and violent movie that was worth seeing it was edgy and definitely warranted the r rating but it wasnt over the top gross it was clever and funny enough to balance it out statham was out of his environment in a comedy and i felt he was trying too hard but it worked out overall maccarthy is always a hoot and does a fantastic job of playing the overweight homely administrative side kick of the dashing james bond type jude law there were the typical fat jokes and some got a little repetitive but most of the comedy drew loud responses from the audience and i found myself even giggling out loud at some of the more benign gags byrne was gorgeous and i think i saw her trying her best not to crack up at times playing her role as a nasty rich bitch criminal involved in hooking up some really bad guys with a nuclear device it was a mish mash of comedy slap stick violence murder and espionage a lot of fun with a twist stay for the very end after initial credits,comedy
clever creative but somewhat repetitive actioncomedy from some of the team that brought us bridesmaids including stars melissa mccarthy and rose byrne and directorwriter paul feig this is mostly a james bond spoof which i guess partly explains why so many brits seem to work for the cia in the films universe with homages to peter sellars inspector clouseau tossed in for good measure i think technically jude laws suave bondish character is supposed to be american but he exudes british mannersthe script and direction require mccarthy and byrne to carry this and they do great jobs mccarthy as the seemingly bumbling but really quite capable cia agent in the field for the first time and byrne as the seemingly capable but really quite inept international arms dealer whos just taken over the family business from her deceased father they play off each other beautifully which is nice to see because they didnt have nearly as much interaction in bridesmaids to the extent that the film drags it mostly results from excessive time spent on mccarthys increasingly wellworn shtick she is enormously talented but not subtle feig indulges her too often and for too long but they always have byrne in their back pocket to help ground the action and comedy when it threatens to spin wildly off course they are ably assisted by miranda hart and peter serafinowicz both of whom manage to charm their way through very broadly conceived roles and morena baccarin who doesnt get much to do but does it perfectly the films secret weapon and only real surprise is jason statham who is revealed to be a topnotch comedic sensation his hilarious takedown of his own actionstud persona is pitch perfect he is easily the best thing about the movie and makes it worth watching even for people who arent necessarily mccarthy fansthe first time i watched this i was underwhelmed but on a second viewing i found that it works much better with a selfimposed intermission of a few hours roughly half way through that helped me get less fatigued by the sameness of the action and comedy as the film progresses and makes it a fresher more engaging experience,comedy

melissa mccarthy and paul feig team up once again for the film centres on susan cooper mccarthy as a cia agent working a desk job behind the scenes a mission cooper was working goes awry with a friend and colleague killed and a terrorist group possessing a nuke on the run she is chosen to enter the field for the first time to track down her friends killer and stop the sale of a nuclear warheadthis was a pretty decent film mccarthys humour is often hit and miss in my opinion but she does a fair job portraying the awkward and nervous first time cooper the humour in the film is often quite pleasant with action uberstar jason statham doing a fine job himself as an overconfident and bumbling superthe acting was fine for the most part with some hiccups here and there ie 50 cent was in this and it was not a good choicei will say that some of the humour was a complete miss one scene in particular has mccarthy acting as a bodyguard in disguise for one of her targets she takes a rough tone with everyone around her delivering absolute sinkers in the form of tough talking insults the entire scene was awkward and not funny the plot of the film itself also suffered in some ways the plot was easily predictable and the action slightly limp however it was still passable on the wholeall in all was a goofy and fun actioncomedy with melissa mccarthy showing her acting chops and comedy experience in a pleasant way the film suffers from a lack of humour at certain times some limp acting and action and a very mild plot however the humour it offers at times and the likability of much of the cast does shine through and makes this an interesting film that stands above many other similar films we have seen recently i look forward to more from mccarthy and feig,comedy
the beginning of this movie is full of bad jokes as we see melissa mccarthy slew in a pile of worthless banter between someone she has a crush on reminded me of high school honestly and if i werent being honest id tell you i went through this whole movie the first time i watched iti saw the first 2530 minutes and straight turned it off too bad that part of the movie is important for character development or else id just tell you to skip iti figured what the heck ill give it another try this isnt my type of humor quite frankly but i like jason statham and melissa mccarthy but it seems shes stuck in this underdog position with too much to prove all the time meanwhile thats not really the case as she actually is just a ticking time bomb ready to go off but apparently has been equipped without a timer jason statham on the other hand is pretty far off from how he usually is in other movies which actually is a refreshing changeit actually makes for a pretty good actioncomedy when you get pretty deep into the movie about 40 minutes i was probably non stop laughing from there on out as i really try hard to immerse myself in movies no matter how bad so i can write accurate reviews i tend to shy away from those people who just automatically give a movie no chance whatsoever and give it the worst rating possibletheres also a character in the movie called aldo which in my opinion is my favorite character in this movie slightly ahead of jason statham would be in melissa mccarthys favor but she has this repeated pattern of raunchy behavior that sort of draws me off to her although some of her jokes were not bad and required her to be there as well all in all the movie isnt something like blazing saddles but it was a good laugh until the end i wouldnt even watch this with my family honestly because of how weird it can get sometimes but if you can look past that for the real jokes its definitely outweighs the bad and no regrets watching it whatsoever,comedy
it is a very funny moviei think anyone can enjoy this movie i will give it 8 stars out of 10 i deducted two stars because they had these two amazing stars in the movie jason stathom and jude law and they did not use them welli mean if you have jasonyou can use him in a better way overall charlon did good jobthere were some points in the film which were really funnyyou could not stop laughing comedy timing is goodit really gives fun i recommend that you should watch this movie but do not expect like a total fun but still it is worthy of your watchfinal words watch it and enjoy it,comedy
lately melissa mccarthy has just done a string of films in which she plays varying caricatures of melissa mccarthy i watched the heat but regretted it and couldnt even face tammy or identity thief however i decided to give this a go and didnt regret it melissas character of a cia agent whos only ever been in the basement directing the real s over their radios is surprisingly competent when called to the field the obvious similarity may be jonny english but far from a dimwitted who stumbles into the right place melissas susan cooper is actually very competent but plagued by bad luck throughout her mission she saves the day not by being ridiculous and lucky but by actually being a good agent whos also got years of intel from being the one directing the agents for so long another surprise is jason statham who has also only ever played in varying degrees jason statham while he does still play jason statham the cia agent no accent thankfully he plays the comedic foil to melissa better than expected hes over the top and actually funnyso overall a lot better than i was expecting and in fact i think a lot better than any commercials ive seen for it which all tend to focus on melissa in stupid disguises its not oscar worthy but its good fun and i personally felt not as over the top as some might have you believe,comedy
i always appreciate the comedies that dont take themselves too seriously but also dont treat the audience like theyre idiots is a good balance of the physical nonsense humor that melissa mccarthy is known for with a mix of smart and witty humor that ultimately bring in the most laughs its also one of the few action comedies this year that actually is more impressive on the action end than comedic this is all a tribute to paul feig who is establishing himself as a comedic staple of this decadethe best parts of all derive from the fun that this cast has at playing these characters jason statham does indeed steal the show like everyone says but hes even better than advertised hes notably making fun of himself and his numerous over the top action films over the span of his lengthy career the biggest laughs come from his monologues that explain all the great things his character has done for the cia its stathams serious delivery that makes the comedy hit so hardfeig has stated that he was inspired by the james bond franchise which is clearly visible through everything from the opening creditssong characters and its official poster covered in gold goldfinger 1964 the important thing is that its a good spoof how mccarthys character becomes a so quick not the most believable transformation and she does tend to fall into her usual mccarthyisms from her other films but it never takes you out of the film so in all the performances are all good and more importantly fun and the action is surprisingly well handled is definitely worth seeingstatham poking fun at himselfall the actors seem like they are having funfeigs directingbondismsquick transformation into a 7210,comedy
normally i do not like silly american humor but this film is a good people that i read the reviews most hate because they are taking too serious the moviefor who want to watch it please understand it is a comedy based on movies like james bond or mission impossible  in other words based on movies with absurd action scenes and many times do not respect the basic laws of physics it was created this comedy an absurd over the top actioncomedy moviei liked most of the movie except the action part when she get like super  strong but it takes place in the end of the movie until there it is pretty funnyhave fun and do not take this movie so serious,comedy
much better than expectedthe trailer did not do this movie justice after watching the trailer i had no intention of watching this movie but after hearing good feedbacks from friends i decided to give it a try the last 2 movies i watched that starred melissa mccarthy tammy and identity thief had completely destroyed my opinion of her but this movie somewhat restored it i liked her characters development throughout the movieit was funny fastpaced and had a great cast however like most movies these days i found the major plot lines of the movie to be predictable and unoriginalif 2 were to be released i would go probably watch it,comedy
let me just tell you straightforward that the characters i loved the most in were rick ford played by jason statham and also aldo played by peter serafinowicz well the latter actor was until i saw the film unknown to me but i liked his performance so much that i feel the need to watch a couple of his other flicks i also liked rayna boyanov played by the sexy and beautiful rose byrne i mean god she is so bloody hot but as you couldve understood i didnt name the main character susan cooper as one of my favourite well thats because i dont like melissa mccarthy that much she is one of the reasons why i didnt like the film more is itself a selfaware parody to the thriller movie genre namely to the bond moviesthe movie starts as a typical bond movie would start with bradley fineplayed by jude law a secret agent in bulgaria trying to uncover the hidden location of a nuclear bomb jude was perfect for this role because despite this being a comedy with his performance he could give the film a bit of seriousness i even thought to myself while watching this first scene damn he could be a fine james bond after the thrilling ending of all this first scenes we have a credits sequence the most bondesque thing they could have put in there i liked it because it reminded me the desperate i am for spectrebut well then is melissa mccarthy till the end thank god we have those other three characters plus bradley fine otherwise i would have hated the movie i dont she is a bad actress i just simply dont like her that much and those scenes she shared with nancy played by miranda hart well i didnt like them at allspecially the one in the bar where they end up meeting one of the best secret agents on cia karen walker the gags in there are so enforced they were cringe worthy at least for me a major part of the movie besides the jokes were the action sequences well in general they where pretty good although i think paul feig used slowmotion too much reminding me of that despicable hercules movie we had last year starring kellan lutz but as i said before aldo rick and rayna won the film making it very enjoyable the scenes which contained one of these three characters ore the ones i laughed the most one line from aldo made me laugh really hard  one day lady supersusan cooper i will fk you paul feig really needs to be given credit for the direction and the script the parodies are the kind of film that can go worse if not handled properly and i think that feig really made it a real enjoyable flickis truly an enjoyable movie and if you unlike me like melissa mccarthy youll certainly love italdo and rick team up,comedy
finally a movie with melissa mccarthy that you can enjoy this is because her character is finally turned down to a level that is acceptable humor comes mostly from situations and the supporting cast and touching on that supporting cast it is very good jude law jason statham and rose byrne are a lot of fun to watch rose byrne as the baddie of the movie surprised me a lot i think this role will land her a lot of offers for similar characters statham gets a chance to make fun of all those one liner characters he has portrayed so far and finally he gets a chance in a long time to stretch his acting muscles a bitd,comedy
the comedy of the film is about being discredited for being fat clich  but its funny for a comedy film is 10however it also has very good action scenes shame that in most of the scenes i can to realize the stunt which leads to be a bit funny  she is running jumping fighting shooting etc very good but the history lane of the film is not that good some mistakes of time and bullets but nothing that makes the comedy goes down it is awesometherefore the sum of the work the film is funny nothing predictable captivating  i hope to see more of those movies thats what comedy istranslated by from portugu,comedy
ignore those who moan about how terrible the movie is i mean what did they expect something deep meaningful and eyeopening its one of those movies where you shut down your brain flex your smile muscles and have fun all the way till it endsit just feels like everyone was having fun with the movie the writers the actors the audience including my wife and yours truly hats off to jason statham who managed to give us a few great laughs with the same face that he has in all of his action moviesthe only thought i had when the movie ended is that i felt the same set of warm emotions as if i watched one of those lighthearted french comedies from the 80shope it does well in the boxoffice and i wont need to be convinced to see a couple more sequels provided the same people work on themhell i will be glad if they somehow get that villain lady out of jail so they can develop her relationship with melissa mccarthys character some more10 out of 10 because i cant think of another movie that gave me such a pleasing comedy experience in the last 3 years,comedy
has as much clumsy hilarity as james bond has suave persona it presents myriad of experienced actors from other genres doing bloopers for typical action flicks while not all melissa mccarthys jokes pan out she is a respectable lead role and the collective effort from the cast succeeds in creating a thoroughly amusing comedy which in its best will take audiences breath and replacing them with constant laughtersusan cooper melissa mccarthy is the handler of a brilliant bradley fine jude law after one botched operation she finds herself tangled with criminal boss and assassins as she goes undercover to finish the task there are a lot of jokes on her expense mainly for her contrasting appearance to the glamorous life of spies the fat jokes are quite funny and entertaining though slightly overused much of the effective moments are from the absurdly rude dialogues dropped in expense of the charactersthese best parts come from her interaction with other usually serious actors its definitely an overthetop movie when the overly narcissistic jude law is probably the least peculiar character he still carries the playboy attitude and the movie decides he should channel this particular trait of james bond for the slightly antagonist character rose bryne fills the spot i had a hard time recognizing this once haunted housewife renai lambert from insidious as she grudgingly stares passionately curses and decides poorly like a syndicate boss would domy personal favorite is jason statham his role is so exaggerated it may very well be inspired by chuck norris jokes the pathological urge to use profanity and his constant misplaced confidence are furthest things from his usual gimmick yet he pulls it off with full conviction for a comedy movie some of the action sequences are actually presentable fights are wellchoreographed especially one particular knife battlethe excessive nature might not always work but when hits its stride theres no stopping these inelegant incompetent agents from extracting laugh from audience,comedy
all the bad reviews have one thing in common saying this is for children or people under 30 or whatever well i only saw this movie because my 60 parents told me it was hilarious at 32 i also found it a bit juvenile but i was literally laughing the entire movie so what if it was childish it is a comedy and hilarious if people cant understand why this has over a 7 rating then those people all have a terrible sense of humor as funny is funny and no amount of cursing or other offensive things will take away the funnyif you have a sense of humor at all and arent easily offended then you will die laughing at this movie regardless of your age or sex if your sense of humor is non existent and are easily offended then simply dont watch this movie but know that you are the minority as the rating of this movie will prove that,comedy
i laughed so much with this movie and i enjoy it even more to be honest i am not a fan of movies like james bond but a parody like this is more than welcome melissa mccarthy is great as an undercover cia agent so different of what we have seen so far all the characters are interesting and hilarious has a purpose to make you laugh and it does it very successfully the plot itself is a little thin but there are some good twists towards the end the inappropriate jokes the goofy jason statham and the killer lines of mccarthy will make this movie an experience that you will forget  eventually  but you will laughing for days until that happen not bad at all,comedy
im not a fan of the heat and the trailers for this looked just awful i finally broke down and went when the positive word of mouth started to really get traction and its funny its really really funny but not just funny its smart instead of relying solely on fat jokes and broad slapstick the movie repeatedly searches for humor in its theme the idea that traditionally unattractive women are invisible in our society repeatedly the film digs its teeth into that concept and tears in taking a break only to mock other forms of misogyny in the workplace this sustained thematic attack elevates everything about the film and speaks to whats appealing about mccarthy as a performer also mccarthys character is incredibly capable if a little insecure and so the comedy never comes from her incompetence i found that incredibly refreshingits true that feig isnt much of an action director but if youre going to this for the action then youre barking up the wrong tree having said that mccarthy actually turns out to be the most interesting action star this year and putting her in the role of badass is inspired also rose byrne utterly outstanding,comedy
this and the kingsman are the two funniest movies i have seen the last decade however where the the kingsman is an elegant over the top violent movie the is an elegant action movie with funny surprises where things goes wrong and the humor can be vulgar from time to time plump but done perfectly definetly not a family comedy to watch with the kids but a great laugh for grown ups i have not laughed as much in years and i am a person that not usually laughs of vulgarities jason statham is fantastic in his role making fun of his own film character he has build over the years you will love the film if you allow the crazyness to entertain you and hate it if you cant accept profanitiessex jokes and expect a political correct movie,comedy
man mccarthys fantastic but this movie is a huge let down i buy an obese inexperienced agent going into the field nice change from yet another hot lady becoming agent penis photos ok finebut then it just goes downhill and gets straight down stupid and completely unbelievable the sweet shy agent suddenly becomes a badass who spews convoluted insults left and right which reminds me of other mccarthy characters and make me wonder if the rest of her movie career will be a series of typecast rolesnot sure how this movie has a 71 on here or how anyone thought it was a good idea in the first place it had potential but man what a pile of doo,comedy
i went into this film with low expectations and ended up really enjoying the film i spent most of the time laughing out loud the dialogue was superb and i was really happy to see that even though melissa mccarthy plays a primarily comedic role the character is actually the most intelligent of all the characters in the filmjason stratham miranda hart and peter serafinowicz were outstanding in their roles each character brought unique humour to the film resulting in an entertaining ensemble kudos for paul feig for a wellwritten comedy this one reminded me of the old get smart movies from my childhood days,comedy
this is my first time writing a review and im doing it because this movie was that good everyone from melissa mccarthy to jude law to rose byrne and especially jason statham was in top comedic form and it wasnt just crass toilet jokes either  you had sight gags running jokes parody of movie clichs ridiculous characters oh and funny action sequences to rival the best of jackie chans physical comedy on top of it all there was a coherent storyline that actually held the movie together people thought the heat was funny which it was but this made me and everyone else in the theater die from laughter from beginning to end i wont give spoilers but just go see it,comedy
watching the trailer i thought oh no  not another one of these comedies you know the ones that people would forget about two weeks after its release and then be reminded of them when they see the same movie in the bargain bin months later the trailer made it seem like it one of those moviesboy was it misleadingthis movie genuinely surprised me in that it not only made me laugh quite loudly i must add but also managed to offer something many other parody movies have failed to offer originality although the plot may seem predictable and trite as it contains many tropes common in movies there were a couple of twists that kept things interesting for methe humour in this film is not classy expect a barrage of curse words and quickwitted insults to fly out of just about everyones mouths the action scenes are well choreographed and perfectly timed if youre a fan of the loud and immature humour of the jump street franchise then youll have no problem enjoying the humour hereaside from melissa mccarthy who just shines as susan cooper both jason statham and rose byrne are hilarious in their portrayals of a ridiculouslyhardened and spoilt heiress respectively also props to jude law for taking a risk and playing a cheesierversion of james bond i think hell work well in an actual action thrillerfilmthe only problem that i have with this film is that its a little too long maybe if feig or 20th century fox cut it down by ten or fifteen minutes then this movie would be better all in all is a wellthought out and gutbusting movie  even if it is clich confusing and cacophonous at times the effort really shows,comedy
can you imagine me as a its a safe bet to say that melissa mccarthy is at her comedic best when working alongside writer and director paul feig bridesmaids and the heat so if you were worried about her recent failings in identity theft and tammy fear not because delivers plenty of laughs and interesting action sequences mccarthy can easily be discarded for repeating the same gags but she proves that when given an intelligent script she can continue to deliver strong comedic roles it helps that feig is a fan of the genre and he cleverly manages to balance the action set pieces with the comedic moments spoof films have grown tiresome over the past years but when done correctly they can still be entertaining and is such a film the film didnt open strong with me but it eventually grew on me as mccarthys character was empowered in mccarthy plays the under confident susan cooper a cia analyst who serves as the eyes and ears of one of the agencys top field agents bradley fine jude law it becomes evident from the opening sequence that fine is a spoof of james bond but i felt those moments a bit forced when a mission goes wrong and the identities of all of the spies in the agency have been compromised elaine crocker allison janny the agencys stern boss decides to send susan to europe to uncover a conspiracy involving an arms dealer who is trying to sell a nuclear bomb to terrorists the elegant dealer rayna boyanov is hilariously played by rose byrne who is convincing as one of the main villains in the film susans mission in europe is compromised however when the aggressive agent rick ford jason statham dismisses orders to stay clear from the site and decides to infiltrate the location despite having his cover blown the interplay between susan and rick and between susan and rayna are by far the highlight of the film as these actors play off each other extremely well despite some hilarious scenes involving statham mccarthy and byrne misses some marks with a couple of characters jude law is an incredibly talented actor but i wasnt a fan of his role here he might be spoofing james bond but its statham who delivers the most laughs poking fun of the macho character he has played during most of his career it was great to see him back in a comedic role after his initial collaborations with guy rithcie snatch and lock stock and two smoking barrels the cameo with 50 cents was also quite horrendous and forced miranda hart also has an important supporting role as one of susans best friends in the agency but i wasnt a particular fan of her character and most of her jokes fell flat despite missing the mark at times is still hilarious when it centers on mccarthy statham and byrne the feminist message might be too loud and obvious but it works extremely well for a genre film where females are often overlooked and reduced to desk jobs also succeeds at delivering genuine suspense as we follow the hero trying to solve the case there are memorable action sequences that take place in a kitchen and on a private jet that are incredibly entertaining and its not something you see in spoof films balances the comedy very well and it delivers the action that espionage films have us accustomed to i had a lot of fun with it httpestebueno10blogspotcom,comedy
there is plenty of action here in this james bondlike takeoff and melissa mccarthy just proves what a heavy set woman can do when pressed into servicei loved the helicopter and plane scenes and the car chases were just as goodas a cia who goes into active service following the supposed murder of an agent she adored jude law mccarthy is fun to watch here not funny is the constant vulgarity jason stratham a british agent who supposedly resigned but keeps showing up cant get through a sentence without that major profanity word it really hurts this pictureafter the bondlike opening sequence the credits roll and we hear a takeoff of shirley basseys goldfinger its not that song but it reminded me of itthere is plenty of duplicity and double dealing in this caper what are we led to believe in the end regarding mccarthys sexual orientation,comedy
susan cooper melissa mccarthy is a skilled cia support operator for agent bradley fine jude law she works in the vermininfested basement with the rest of the support staff rayna boyanov rose byrne has stolen a nuclear bomb fine is killed by rayna and she has the identity of all the agents deputy director elaine crocker allison janney decides to send in the unknown cooper to track weapons dealer sergio de luca bobby cannavale agent rick ford jason statham goes rogue to find the nuke himself with the help of fellow support staff nancy and creepy local aldo susan has to exceed her mandate when fords presence is detected and her assignment becomes impossiblethis is a fun film from paul feig melissa mccarthy pulls back her manic behavior a little to bring a more balanced character there are a couple of wackier characters that form fun comedy duos with her the best is statham his ridiculousness is hilarious and their exchanges are gutbusting its fun whenever these other characters put her down the last act loses some comedic steam there is a need to wrap up the dramatic story but it could have been done simpler and with more comedy overall its a fun time with lots of big laughs,comedy
just watched this with my movie theatreworking friend he thought it was mostly okay while i thought it was mostly funny due to the constant pop culture references sprinkled throughout the movie lots of uses of the fword probably also contributed to my laughing a lot and maybe some of the physical stunts of which most seemed pretty serious written and directed by paul feig and starring melissa mccarthyboth having previously teamed for heat i thought this was both humorous enough and a little suspenseful to keep one on its toes and despite my mentioning the use of a certain word this wasnt as vulgar as one feared so on that note i highly recommend ps this was the second film in a row i saw both rose byrne and bobby cannavale sometimes sharing scenes the other being the recent annie remake,comedy
i have to admit before i begin that i am just not a fan of melissa mccarthy her type of humor constant banter or whatever you want to call it has never really appealed to me it seems like her jokes are forced in your face and are nothing but oneliners but luckily this was a role that fit her better than her past roles though not better than her breakout role in bridesmaidsthat being said was a nice change of pace in the sense that mccarthy had a sound out supporting cast around her to help carry the weight of the movie even if the story carries very little originality they helped balance out the equation as well as help create some solid banter between mccarthy and themselves jason statham and peter serafinowicz were the best of the bunch their characters were basically just walking clichs and they were hilarious stathams over the top macho agent persona who delivers nothing but the most ludicrous stories was amazing and serafinowiczs ultraaggressive sexual advances were nothing short of hilarious and the best bits from melissa come early in the first half of the movie when her character is still getting used to being a field agent it isnt until the halfway point that the movie slowly starts to decline the dialog becomes nothing but crass language melissas characters loses all her charm and the runtime sets in but as a whole did a good job at poking fun at traditional thrillers as well as dropping some completely ridiculous original gags the batrodent infestation in the basement of the cia it is safe to say that if you are a fan of melissa mccarthy then you will undoubtedly love comedy is very subjective and like i said melissa just doesnt do it for me most of the time fortunately this was one of her better roles and this type of story suited her quite well,comedy
stathan being stathan superberb performance they should make a tv show with him with that character,comedy
melissa mccarthy has become the funny girl of movies and at best i knew i would enjoy her role in this movie but i got more much more i laughed throughout the entire movie keeps you laughing yet this comedy also had a great story that as a movie alone kept my interest well acted by all and in my head a throw back to the pink panther movies if you need a laugh and love silly comedy followed by twist and turns with action to boot this may be the funny movie of the year from start to finish this will keep your attention i would watch it again comedy with smarts,comedy
such high reviews such a formulaic genre comedy spoilers to followi just dont get why a comedy cant be a comedy why do we need borne mi 24 type chase scenes i know this is called but why do we need hanging off helicopters cant we just have the funny ive seen enough borne and superhuman over the top action fighting to last me a lifetimemccarthy is funny when shes put upon disrespected and awkward shooting guys in the head isnt whats funny about the movie so why spend so much time on the noncomedic action that weve all seen a million times done better in serious filmsplus they have foreigners in parts that shouldve been americans and americans when they shouldve been foreign why is the englishman playing an american but the guy with the cane is american yet seems to be from hungary and has no accent why is a woman with a thick english accent working for the ciaa few chuckles mainly in the quiet parts once the film gets loud plotheavy and fast the funny drains away needed to be less ambitious they had too much budget burning a whole in their pocket too much plot too much action drowned out 80 of the potential comedy,comedy
i honestly did not expect to laugh this much at a hollywood blockbuster comedy the trailers for this film did not actually do it justice i watched it because of melissa mccarthys good resume mccarthys improvisations during the film are as always hilarious and satisfying i did not expect her to be this good in action and fight scenes though i was on the fence about jason statham in a comedy since he can only do one character but his character was used skillfully to create most unexpected exploding laughs his monologues are also very funny especially the first one although after a while they get shorter and also lose a little of their funny juice the last ten minutes was a bit too cheesy for my taste but it was saved by the last joke and i left the movie theater feeling refreshed there was only one clich over the top character but it didnt bother me much because the jokes were there and boy were they funny the love story was kind of related to the plot but the movie could have been even better without it it feels a bit forced since jude law is just not made for comedy one of the things that really stood out for me which i had not seen used well in many movies before was the use of really brutal violent and even disgusting scenes for comedy the result in most movies is just a sick feeling in your stomach while cursing the writer who thought vomit or gore itself are funny enough no matter the context but the movie has some great jokes right after or even during some of the most brutal scenes which otherwise wouldve been sickening overall this is certainly the best blockbuster comedy of the year and it is actually worth the ticket price because you will laugh constantly good writing good directing and funny actors i saw old people young people teenagers couples all laughing hard and constantly with me during the movie,comedy
well that was surprisingly funny and not terrible as i thought it was going to bethe story is about a cia analyst who just so happens to be responsible for the success of some of the most dangerous missions but when her partner suddenly disappears and another top agent is compromised she finds herself going from behind the desk to into the field  deep undercover to infiltrate the inner circle of an arms dealer and prevent a global catastrophespoof movies on films isnt anything new we seen some good and we also seen some really bad ones that are not written very well and the jokes are just flat and retarded starring melissa mccarthy looked the same and i didnt really care about until the film got its early reviews from critics and it got positive reviews so i just seen the movie last night and i thought the film is a very funny comedy and its ten times better than tammy that we got last yearmelissa mccarthy can be a hit or miss with me because i know she can do a great performance in comedy movies i mean she got nominated for oscar in bridesmaids so thats saying something in this movie i thought she was going to be a clumsy over weight women who always slip up and makes things worse you know the clichs in those comedys but i was extremely surprised that this didnt happen in this movie as meliassa mccarthy character has a comedic ark to her but she also played a different character and not the ones that she normally pick melissa mccarthy did a good comedic performance in this movie and she did better in this movie then in tammythe director of the paul feig who previous did bridesmaids the heat and hes doing the upcoming ghostbusters movie he directed the movie pretty good and although out the film i keep thinking of the heat that he did and im saying that in a positive way as it shows he can mix action with comedy very well great work paul feigthe rest of the cast in the movie like jude law rose byrne and jason statham all three did great in the movie as both got they own funny lines and at least they wasnt wasted like in some other movies seem to do with a big cast like this but luckily it worked out finethe writing was good the one liners in the movie has to be funniest one liners ive heard since the movie whiplash and some of jokes really workednow for the problems some of the jokes in the movie are sometimes predictable and just fell flat to me i know this may sound like a small little nick pick to most people but the movie has a jame bond like opening just like bond films always open but of cause this movie does its own take on it and it really wasnt all that good as i said before its a small little nick pick but it could have been a lot better im just sayingoverall is decent comedy and its way better then some spoof movies on films the acting was good some of the jokes worked paul feig directed the movie with style by mixing the action and comedy and the movie is enjoyable to watch,comedy
review i hated this movie because it offers absolutely nothing from the action comedy perspective the direction and screenplay are terrible the casting and acting are terrible also all in all i would give this zero out of a possible five starsthe who dumped me,comedy
i thought this movie was fantastic it started solid with some really good jokes but once susan melissa mccarthyfinds her confidence then so does the movie the jokes come fast and mostly hit the target the supporting cast were superb especially statham who sends up not just every character he has played since snatch but basically every bad ass macho man we have seen since the 80sthe weakest part of the movie is the actual espionage element of the story with some flip flopping in the final 3rd that didnt make much sense other than to move the story along but at that point i was laughing so much i didnt really carewhile in the past mccarthy has shown herself to be a very funny comedian she can often miss the mark as much as she hits it but with i feel she has been really allowed to shine maybe its because her comedic style is so abrasive that it worked for her in as we first meet her as a put upon office worker who is contently overlooked and then when she finally gets to unleashes on everyone its great fun to see and to root for herid really recommend this movie for anyone looking for a good laugh and who doesnt like to laugh,comedy
i actually really wanted to see this movie when it first came out considering i really enjoyed kingsman the secret service another 2015 comedy i was hoping for something great unfortunately it really isnt anything special the plot of is pretty average the new has to stop a nuclear weapon from being sold and causing bad things to happens and ends up going on a little adventure where everything goes wrong but still works out anyways its quite predictable for the most part but some parts were still at least a little unexpected the characters are pretty average unlikely hero attractive super angry manager geeky friend etc weve seen them all before nothing new here the jokes in the movie can be funny but often arent once again weve heard many of these jokes before in the exact same kinds of movies the unfunny ones just ended up feeling pointless which took away from the movie a little bit i felt like the idea of the movie was supposed to be a joke too but it took itself too seriously most of the time so i really didnt know what to think some jokes were poorly timed too or just not good for the set mood despite all this i still found myself laughing throughout the movie sometimes pretty stinking hard overall is just an alright movie it tries to be both serious and funny at the same time and while that can work it doesnt work here it also lacks in plot originality predictability and clich underdeveloped characters while some parts are quite good it ended up still being a very unoriginal movie in the end id only recommend this movie if your looking just to sit down and mindlessly watch something dont expect anything great,comedy
the culminating moment in 2014s atrocious paul feigless melissa mccarthy comedy tammy was when the titular character was hit by a car lesser writers and directors want mccarthy to be the funny fat lady they want her to fall through tables and yell at the top of her lungs mccarthy is good at this and it happens from time to time in director paul feigsbridesmaids the heat latest comedy however thats not the only joke and punchline physical violence is used as an end to some of the rather exhilarating action set pieces this film has to offer it sort of serves as feigs demo reel for an action film however the humor comes from the writing when mccarthy gets to belittle an assistant by saying she is going to staple his reproductive organ to his head so he looks like a unicornwhen she orders a wine that she describes as like a hummusthe humor comes from her intelligence and comic timing not just her ability to break furniture this is where truly shines in the film mccarthy plays susan cooper an intelligence officer whose permanently talking in the ear of bradley finejude law in a fun opening scene we see how its her doing all the work as she points out entrances and exits guards and traps when fine is kidnapped she has to go undercover and infiltrate a mysterious arms dealer further complicating things is his daughterrose byrne and fordjason statham a rogue agent whose basically a parody of every jason statham movie ever is first and foremost a comedy but its also an action filmas discussed above feig directs action rather generically but it comes as a fun change of pace from all the verbal sparring its also an empowerment story but a lowkey one it wasnt advertised as such but it would be the best example of a great female character this year if mad max hadnt come out it is a dash too long the plot is more than a dash too convoluted and some of the jokes start to get a bit old when its in its prime however it reminds us that melissa mccarthy is not just the funny fat lady and paul feig is not just another judd apatow they are both so much more,comedy
melissa mccarthy may as well be a genre unto herself these days after applying her somehowstillnottired schtick of foulmouthed slapstick with an undercurrent of sweetness to weddings and buddy cop capers alike its a pretty seamless transition into the pantheon of bond spoofs that increasingly run the risk of outperforming 007 himself like many of its genregender bending contemporaries manages to hit that sweet spot middle point between throwaway star vehicle and more than the sum of its parts  derivative largely forgettable but fun and funky enough to be worth its weight in exploding hemorrhoid removal cream writerdirector paul feig is clearly motivated by taking the pss out of the notoriously misogynist bond tradition but is canny with his feminism here we have the timeworn caper framework but inhabited by a female lead comedic relief sidekick villain and curmudgeonly superior but feig never makes a big thing of it allowing the inevitable gender politics to play themselves out without any fuss sans grandiose statement it helps of course to gird the whole shebang with prime spoofery including some genuinely engaging globetrotting action sequences though the bursts of shockingly graphic gore take it a step too far and even its very own impressively catchy bondian title track its the sign of a good parody when there are bits when you catch yourself getting nearly too swept up to remember its meant to poke fun at the genre youre enjoying savvy audiences will know to come for the pastiche and stay for the gags though and while feig has yet to escape from the judd apatow shroud of flabby editing and sequences of excessively generous riffing and a 130 minute running time  at least 20 too long  is indulgent indeed he specializes in the cutaway gag of which is chockfull some zany the rats have wings some gross some which veer from one into the other and back again oh god not on him not on him proves 2015s repository of daft comedic quotes to beat  you can practically make a short film out of the deranged boasting rants of jason stathams exquisitely oblivious rogue agent alone overlong and clumsy as the results may be the throw spaghetti at the wall and see what sticks approach to comedy is nonetheless bound to win laughs from just about everyone at some point or another if anything feig has enthusiastically assembled such a stellar ensemble cast that the proceedings grow almost worrisomely overcrowded at times but too much of a good thing is still a fairly welcome complaint mccarthy herself remains the highlight with a ferociously enjoyable leading performance that weaves in her recurring archetypes of mousy lovable loser and bombastic elaboratethreatspewing piledriver and somehow grounds both in an impressively believable and endearing character near impossible not to take to rose byrne is an impressively terrifying scenestealer as the resident ice queen evil mastermind almost as frightful when scathingly critiquing mccarthys wardrobe as menacing undercover agents with a gun and feig is wise enough to let her and mccarthy rip into one another with enough voraciously trashtalking banter to make goldfinger blush miranda harts sweetly awkward act toes the line of overuse as mccarthys sidekick but wins enough genuinely unexpected guffaws to be well worth her while while statham is consistent comedic gold lampooning his action man persona like a champ jude law naturally was born to live and breathe bond withoutbond and allison janney grumbles like the best of them as the surprisingly unfussy cia director while peter serafinowicz is reliably hysterical as a boorish italian agent even if bobby cannavales slick arms dealer feels like an extraneous dud of a last minute threat flounders a bit with one or two twists plot lines or characters too many lacking the taut precision that would elevate it to the hot fuzz calibre of classic spoof nonetheless feig and mccarthy continue to be a modest dream team of reliable laughs and nonchalantly progressive genre tweaking and their seesawing between clever goofy crass and sweet still has mileage aplenty as loathe as i am to admit it in the epoch of unwarranted sequels susan cooper could prove a concoction who  shock gasp im going to kick myself for this later  wouldnt be too abhorrent to cinematically only live twice even better i aint fraid of no ghosts bring the noise710,comedy
this was a good film in general with a good cast that is in some ways out of their right element it is really fun and entertaining and there is a lot to love about this film in my honest opinionit is really the cast that makes this film stick and be really great and funny melissa mccarthy is in an all time high maybe a bit typical funny role but her character is out of her usual elements in many ways she is the silent awkward type and it is really good jude law is the dashing british that really has it all but is flawed in the way that he gets a bit too much of himself and doesnt know what is really going on around him jason statham is in many ways the same he is a but a more dumb one hard hitting shooting and moving on in a fast pace is his style but he is not that clever and way to hard headed these three spies really compliment each other in this film and have a lot of help from different sides but it is fun seeing them in and out of their typical elementsthe film is entertaining very classic in its class in many ways but does have the humor and strange extra scenes here and there to keep the viewer alert and see what is really going on in this melissas role of susan cooper is just great she saves countless mishaps and strange behaviors not appropriate for a real  there is a lot to see in this and it really is just a well oiled comedy machine both in scenes characters events fights shootouts and much more,comedy
is a comedicfemale version of james bond with a lot more hilarious trashtalk and more failed missions than one would expect from a socalled movie melissa mccarthy plays susan cooper a stereotypical shy genius who works in a secret cia underground facility she is the righthand man to bradley fine portrayed by pretty boy actor jude law coopers role was to help support fine from behind the scenes by assisting him via bluetooth in which she lets him know where enemies are approaching how many people are surrounding him and ordering missiles to shoot at precise locations she provides when the time calls for it cooper had a onesided love with fine and when she thought fine had died at the hands of an arms dealer she began the plan to avenge his death the aforementioned arms dealer goes by the name of raina she is played by the devilishly beautiful rose byrne right after raina supposedly killed fine she revealed that she knows all the true identities of the cia agents in the field this along with her plot to avenge the man she loves death caused cooper to volunteer to go out into the field to find raina and track down a stolen nuclear bomb isnt only about capturing the bad guys this movie shows the evolution of a woman who was invisible to both her peers and the man that she loved to becoming a who kicks butt in the field and saves the day cooper was unknown to the villains of this movie because she kept her head down in the cia and operated in the background now she calls her own shots and leads others into battle she developed confidence in her line of work and has a newfound sense of respect for herself by loving who she is and not being ashamed of it the only questionable part about this movie was the directors casting choice of bradley fine jude law certainly had the looks for the part but ryan gosling would have made a better fine gosling would have put more of a charm towards fines personality which would have made more sense seeing as how cooper fell for him gosling would have made a more convincing character as fine and would have overall made the movie blend better together throughout the movie is a series of endless laughs and witty comebacks this movie is a mix between james bond and paul blart mall cop although this movie shows these spies having some amazing skills in kicking the bad guys butts this movie also shows idiotic failings a 10 year old could figure out like not storming into a black market bomb deal and knocking yourself out ford if you want to see a successful and witty hero in an action packed movie then go watch tnt movies on the television however if you want a good laugh see things get blown up then this is the movie for you,comedy
susan coopermelissa mccarthy a desk bound cia analyst finally gets a chance to go undercover after one of there top spies named bradley finejude law is killed while on a mission susan wants to prove herself even though everybody else believe she screw up big time will she prove them wrong i like the way this film is not a totally spoof where the story plays itself straight and the comedy gets brought in melissa mccarthy really does shine here i liked her comedic timing playing off the insanity not mention miranda hart who plays her friend i hope she and mccarthy will team up again cause the two are quite a funny pairing jason statham is good here kind of making fun of himself as a action film star jude law and rose byrne are also great in there supporting roles action scenes are quite amusing kind of feels like a send up of james bond and jason bourne im begging the filmmakers please make a sequel,comedy
this film is so much fun its got a kickass central performance by melissa mccarthy complemented by great shows from an alist cast as well as fantastic action a suspenseful if not generic plot and consistently hilarious laughoutloud comedythis is by far one of the better james bond parodies much like this years kingsman the secret service it satirises the genre perfectly throwing in brilliant injokes and witty copies of classic bond moments and tropes making for a lot of laughs whilst it also successfully adds brilliant action and a story that is massively excitingthe funniest thing about this film is that it is quite foulmouthed and full of unpredictable humour from start to finish its a quick paced comedy that throws so many jokes at you youll need to watch it again to have a chance of catching them all because everything is simply so funny and it even has a good shock value with such a high swear count and excessively comical but often bloody violencemelissa mccarthy is absolutely stunning here she plays her generic underdog character like in films such as the heat and identity thief but she adds a bit of shine to what was quickly becoming a tiresome character showing off quite a slick image in some of the latter stages of the film to go against her stereotype which not only fits perfectly into the film but is a nice surprise to see what else she can dothe rest of the performances are fantastic too jude law plays a kickass pseudo007 jason statham brilliantly makes fun of himself in an overthetop sweary statham role whilst rose byrne is an incredibly suave and sexy villain as well as being a lot of fun when it comes to the slapstick and sillier side to the plotthat plot is on the whole thrillingly entertaining of course you know whats going to happen its the most generic plot in the world but the globetrotting the slick gadgets the countless criminals all make it into a rapidfire thrill ride thats just as enjoyable as any bond or mission impossible moviefinally the action here is also incredible to watch melissa mccarthy does a great job of getting stuck into some very action packed sequences again deriving from her stereotypical on screen persona whilst the visual effects explosions and fight sequences throughout are both brilliant to witness as well as hilarious to watchoverall im giving this an 8 because its a thrilling action packed and hilarious parody that keeps up high quality comedy throughout that will leave you in tears of laughter by the end,comedy
i saw starring melissa mccarthymike  mollytv bridesmaids jason stathamthe expendables movies the pink panther2006 rose byrne insidious bridesmaids jude lawrepo men sky captain and the world of tomorrow and allison janneymomtv west wingtvthis is a female version of james bondjane bondone of my favorite movie characters with some humor thrown in it even opens with a james bond type musical number and action scenes it is directed by paul feig who also handled the heat and bridesmaids both with melissa melissa plays a cia analyst that works with jude a suave james bond styled secret agent that usually gets the job done melissa has gone through the training required for an agent but has never done any actual field work when jude actually fails on a job involving rose the villain in control of a nuclear bomb melissa volunteers to go into the field and finish judes missionit seems that rose knows all the identities of the regular cia agents including jason allison plays the boss at cia headquarters and gives melissa her chance to show what she can do the action scenes are very good with one in particular being a confrontation in a kitchen involving melissa a knife a frying pan and an evil villainous henchwoman that really looked good jason has several good fight scenes too but he is also very funny it seems that he likes to exaggerate his exploits just a tad and some of his stories are really stretching believability a bithe is sort of a cross between rambo and inspector clouseau fyi melissas real life husband ben falcone makes his usual cameo he is the tourist that asks melissa for directions to a burger king as the credits start there is a scene and during the credits are clips of more missions with another scene at the very end after the end credits its rated r for violence language and sexual contentincluding nudity and has a running time of 2 hours being a james bond fan i really liked this one and would buy it on blu ray,comedy
the idea of the cia being good guys is already very difficult to believe but its a movie i can set aside my cynical doubts long enough to have a laugh but unfortunately there are not many in this movie melissa mccarthy gives it an admirable try i cant really fault her she just needed better material jude law was pretty respectable toojason statham was just horrible not funny at all and he felt tacked on at the end like they made the movie decided it needed more something and added him in thats not really what happened statham was involved since shooting started but thats how it felt anywaysby the end it just drags on i think its because they only have a couple gagsjokes and they implement them all multiple times wearing out the humor factor quickly,comedy
follows susan cooper melissa mccarthy a cia desk operative who volunteered to go on a mission upon learning of a terrorists plan to take out all of the agencys top field agents an unlikely choice for fieldwork she travels around europe following suspected arms dealer rayna boyanov rose byrne as rogue agent rick ford jason statham attempts to interrupt her mission in order to show the agency that he is their most indispensable agentthe movie combines comedy and action seamlessly stathams comedic timing and unapologetic quips work well with his classic action star stunts mccarthy on the other hand showed versatility as she embodied different person as that ranged from being susan the pushover to ruthless amber valentine with quick dialogue and highflying stunts is a film that relies on the unpredictability of all its characters bringing in the laughs until the end,comedy
from bond to bourne by way of the naked gun and johnny english movies about covert operatives kicking butt and saving the day  not always intentionally  have become a genre unto themselves thats why the advent of paul feigs is faintly depressing how is a femaleled comedy spoofing the secret world of spies only happening now in 2015 at least theres nothing at all depressing about the film itself is a blast of fun cheeky adrenaline which cleverly sends up the dudecentric conventions of the genre while crafting a world and characters that both embrace and defy stereotypessusan cooper mccarthy wanted a life of adventure and mystery when she joined the cia however despite turning in an outstanding performance at the training academy shes faded almost literally into the background in the perennially vermininfested confines of cia hq she commiserates with fellow desk jockey nancy hart while providing able support for the agencys top operative cocky suave bradley fine law but when fine runs afoul of ruthless arms dealer raina boyanov byrne susan finds herself in a unique position to take action  shes the only fullytrained agent who is also a complete unknown in the fieldmany spoofs falter in balancing comedy with plot and action  a problem that largely manages to avoid until its almost breathlessly overstuffed ending feigs script is sharp and witty poking fun at character and convention while never losing sight of the power of a good pratfall considering how many gags and jokes he packs into each frame of the film its a marvel that so many land as well as they do but land they do from the almost outrageously frumpy cover identities susan is stuck with to the frankly ridiculous rogue antics of rick ford statham an unpredictable hotheaded agent who resigns in a ragefuelled fit of machismo when susan is tasked to pick up where fine left offbeyond the comedy however what keeps the film chugging along is the fact that feig also cannily supplies susan with plenty of credible obstacles derived from plot and character theres the nominal villain of course petulant haughty raina who orchestrates death and destruction without blinking an eye but the plot extends beyond raina and her histrionics susan has quite a few lovely character moments too not only does she turn her invisibility to her advantage when she first observes then infiltrates rainas operation susan also demonstrates to everyone herself included that she really is every bit as competent  if not more so  than her male counterpartsfeig even throws in some action sequences worthy  and deliberately reminiscent  of a topgrade flick from an escape on a motorboat under heavy fire through to a spectacular midair confrontation between the forces of good and evil the fight scenes are brutally wellchoreographed with susan giving every bit as good as she gets as she efficiently takes down everyone in her path that said does stumble a little as it barrels towards its gigantic final setpiece the action beats building up in a way that suggest feig is trying to write himself out of a tough spotbut feig never loses sight of his main character who proves to be the finest gift hes yet given to his muse yes that includes the oscar nomination she picked up for her role in bridesmaids and her enduring friendship with sandra bullock her costar in the heat susan is a role that sits comfortably in mccarthys wheelhouse allowing her to deploy her irrepressible charm and impeccable comic timing while also suggesting a wealth of emotion and depth beneath a relentlessly sunny exterior but its also a role that allows audiences to look beyond the brash loud characters shes become known for in her film career  one that celebrates mccarthy as a comedian an actress and a person the fact that the film never once doubts susans abilities in the field is one of the most empowering statements youll see in a film this yearthough shes more than capable of doing so mccarthy doesnt have to carry the entire film by herself feig has provided her with a stellar supporting cast  including allison janney as susans humourless boss and peter serafinowicz as an italian contact with a healthy appreciation of susans wiles law turns in a sparklingly selfdeprecating performance as the films version of bond while hart bumbles her way endearingly through proceedings in much the same way she does on her eponymous hit british sitcombut the real standouts in the supporting cast are byrne and statham both tasked with playing loud outlandish characters who are just barely more than caricatures byrne is delightfully silly as a spoilt daughter who has inherited a highly lucrative nuclear device sneaking quite a bit of charm into the menace that accompanies rainas more callous decisions statham meanwhile flings his grim taciturn demeanour  cultivated and recycled in a string of cookiecutter action thrillers  out the window he plays loose cannon ford with a joyful pomposity thats joyous to watchat a time when the sexism that still riddles hollywood is being actively discussed and dissected courtesy of films like mad max fury road and avengers age of ultron delivers the goods as a feminist twist on a genre that has been dominated by men for far too long its female characters are a magnificent blend of strong and silly tough and tender all at once  incontrovertible proof not that it should be needed in the first place that women are funny and can headline genres typically associated with the male of the species but most importantly of all is delightful in and of itself politics aside this is quite simply a topnotch comedy jammed full of big laughs and bigger action  which is reason enough for it to be a big hit,comedy
after superbradley fine is killed in action his homely and rotund base contact susan volunteers for the followup mission to prevent nuclear weapons falling into terrorist handsmelissa mccarthy is good fun in this role reversal bond spoof which also trades on her diminutive but ample proportions for humorous purposes and the bond spoofery is well done i loved the title sequence jason statham is a hoot as sexist agent rick ford rose byrne is a good icy villainess miranda hart tickles in her first hollywood outing and the cast generally is all good there is actually a decent plot so there is much to enjoy hereand for me the vast majority of that enjoyment was buried under the industrial quantities of profanity which lace this film the first 5 minutes or so is clear then the fbombs start and are constant until the very end and they are unnecessary pretty nearly every one of them adds nothing to the film if they did i wouldnt find them so objectionable for me they spoiled an otherwise very enjoyable film,comedy
loved this movie it exceeded my expectations so much undoubtedly the funniest comedy we have gotten so far filled with really fresh humor there was never a point in the movie that i would feel bored for the first time we see melissa playing an actual badass being absolutely hilarious at the same time jason statham  we have seen him being funny before but in this movie he was hysterical jason was the best part of the movie surprisingly movie had some great action scenes too cant and dont really want to say much more about this title watch it youll love it,comedy
started to watch this film with some scepticism i wrongly assumed that this film would be cheesy with the usual jokes and one liners my interest was raised by the details in the special effects and i loved the way the film jumped in to the comedy from that point it was laugh out loud until the end i would recommend this film to anyone but with a warning do not watch with your children or your parents unless you dont mind a few very awkward moments it may hold a 15 certificate but call me old fashioned as after watching i would have said it should have been a 18 negatives im sorry to say i was not impressed with miranda hart performance but in fairness to her im not a fan but it did not spoil the film for me jason statham on the other hand was brilliant i would love to see a 2 made with the same cast but for me less of miranda,comedy
within the first five minutes of this movie you will get the sense that while you are in for a fun ride with plenty of action you will also get the same amount if not more comedy melissa mccarthy is the lead and is sent undercover because the four best agents are all well known by the lead villain rose byrnethe action that ensues are met with pretty good fight and action choreography along with the hilarious one liners from the entire cast i think every line of dialogue spoken by jason stathams character was hilarious all he does is explain his amazing feats and accomplishments which no living human being could possibly have done he also believes there is a real faceoff machine from the movie faceoffrose byrne is the villain and even she brings some comedy to the table she might have the best line in the entire film youll know which one when you watch it all the actors worked perfectly well and i was laughing throughout the entire movie a solid actioncomedy 810,comedy
the way that my friends speak they seem rather questionable to the idea of a woman playing james bond they seem to have no problem with changing the race or ethnicity of the famous hero but when i brought up the idea of a woman taking over their first response was to shiver and say quietly i dont know about a female bond at first i thought that they were taking an antifeminist stance against such an idea would it not be possible for a woman to infiltrate a terrorist hideout or seduce an enemy agent to get information ive always felt sotodays movie is all about playing up the joke that a woman is becoming a had they picked a scarlett johansson or an angelina jolie then most people would have responded that female spies have already been done and that at lest in cinematic terms weve been holding back more then were worth luckily director paul feig was smart to cast someone who was even less likely to even qualify as a melissa mccarthy a veteran of his previous films bridesmaids and the heat has its mystery and laughs ready to go but does it manage to mix it wellsusan cooper played by melissa mccarthy is a former teacher who enrolled in the cia hoping to change her life and make it more exciting shes saddled with a desk job as an analyst to work behind the scenes for her friend field agent bradley fine played by jude law whose more of the typical james bondlike that cooper wishes she could be a failed mission results in fine having to sneak into the home of rayna boyanov played by rose byrne to retrieve information on the location of a nuke bomb this too ends in failure as fine is supposedly shot to deathnot only is her friend dead but her boss elaine crocker played by alison janney reveals that rayna already knows most of the identities of the top field agents seeing that no one would suspect her cooper volunteers to become a field agent this doesnt suit well with the other hotshot not to mention hothead agent rick ford played by jason statham but cooper is assigned to go to europe to go after rayna cooper manages to get in deeper with rayna and her colleagues much more with her friendly but intimidating attitude and just might pull off a successful missionis a lot like bridesmaids and the heat all three have mellissa mccarthy playing a big part and put this woman in a position that would usually be played by the goofy man my fear was that mccarthy would play the same crass woman that ive seen before but that does not seem to be the case for shes more of an unappreciated underdog who also happens to be good at what shes doing it may have taken me a couple of movies but mccarthy has finally proved me a funny comedianwhat makes work is that this isnt just mccarthys spotlight everyone gets some good scenestealers my favorite being jason statham constantly ranting about his nearly impossible stunts is it as masterful as bridesmaids no as this film stumbles into its own problem of stopping the story to tell more jokes why couldnt most of the jokes progress the story oh well it doesnt totally dampen this movie as far as movies go this plays off of every movie clich from the animated intro with a sexy song to the exotic locations and high tech gadgets balances on the line between comedy and full blown satireill give this eight scooters with roofs out of ten i laughed harder for then i did for the heat though not as much as bridesmaids perhaps paul feig might want to consider branching out into other fields of comedy as not to remain predictable for what it is id say that is a mission to go,comedy
what a glorious joyful romp of a movie this is oh what a relief some real proper humour at last there are some great comic lines throughout but what you might also notice is that there is quite a bit of truth in some of the sometime preposterous set ups coop of course is a super competent agent but she is relegated to the dark fetid basement tied to her computer whilst agent fine lives the high life whilst knocking out the occasional crook it seems even when women have women bosses they are never seen for the potential they truly have coop more than pays back the smidgeon of trust she is eventually allowed nancy hart reprises her bumbling incompetent comedy act but is really just hiding her competence fab was he or wasnt he moment near the end ha ha ha id happily watch this again anytime,comedy
excellent and very american british film with great one liners and all actors played parts brilliantly and chemistry was obvious will have you laughing for days lots of heavy language but fits in well as the jokes keep coming thick and fast to counterbalance fieg also directed bridesmaids and has a long cv of quality comedy acting and producing under his belt byrn is superb as the manipulative yet attractive and powerful boyanov as her character and macarthy keep the pace accelerating  statham is having a ball playing rick whom has had his arm ripped off and replaced by his other arm  even miranda hart gets her man at the end aldo the italian operative for cia is genius  i learn my english from downton abbeyor do imake sure you watch to the end ,comedy
imagine an austin powers movie mixed in with get smart johnny english and 22 jump street starring a woman and you have melissa mccarthys newest flick follows a bumbling wannabe cia special agent as she bounces around exotic european locales to stop evil masterminds from selling wmds like you might imagine there is not a great deal of groundbreaking dialogue or acting in the film but there is something unique about it and i want to take a moment to examine that this year seems to be the year of women at the box office some of the largest grossing films of 2015 have female leads such as cinderella pitch perfect and mad max add to that list it is almost certain to gross over 30 million this opening weekend and may even do better with all the positive critical reviews like those other films led by ladies some are saying has a certain feminist bent it looks at men and makes fun of those who patronize our leading lady and rightfully so as she proves herself more than competent despite things other than her gender getting in the way of her success mccarthy creates a strong character and is pretty funny most of the time the supporting actors likewise are good and jason statham is legitimately enjoyable as a competing international sleuth that makes this movie similar to the others i mentioned above there is however one major difference between those above and still depicts women as dumb socially unaware and desperately dependent for a mans affirmation granted some might argue that cinderella and pitch perfect lean that direction also but there seems to be a distinct difference between how these movies depict women cinderella for one comes from classic material and though the character falls for the prince and wishes for his affection the ultimate conflict arises between her and her evil stepfamily who are the one truly willing to stoop to any level to achieve notoriety with the patriarch pitch perfect likewise is about breaking into an international scene and the struggle of a small unknown group taking on the favorites for the world championship additionally pitch perfect is about sisterhood and not letting the end of something like college be the end of friendship contrast that with where mccarthys homely susan cooper a handler at the cia falls in love with her special agent played by jude law so great is her dedication that his death convinces her to do something that never would have done for herself despite the calling of her childhood dreams its the man that gets her to pursue the field once again and right when you think the movie has chosen to end with the leading lady not falling for the guy but choosing to accompany her best friend on the next adventure the credits sequence reveals differently as she wakes up next to a supporting male character undercutting any credibility the movie had for building strong independent female characters so what gives i want to say i can easily enjoy a movie with a female lead if she is written well furiosa from mad max for example is probably the most compelling character ive seen on screen all year granted genre does change things and is a situation comedy but is it possible to write a strong confident female lead without undermining her credibility i think so above i said reminded me of things like austin powers and get smart both of which have leads who are continually undermined by their own ineptness but those male characters are never doing all of their heroic actions for the sake of some woman they lost in fact some of them discard their lady sidekicks for laughs or somehow also manage to woo another lady and defeat the bad guy in one simultaneous action while we do see susan cooper take out the villain in she does also get rejected by the man she likes do her best to stop the villain only to be told she was the most obvious undercover agent in history only to have it all topped off with bedroom scene where she its implied she has slept with one of the male characters who treated her most poorly cinderella sounds great after that i didnt hate but i didnt love it and i definitely think its an exaggeration to say this movie is a feminist version of other films i think it might be as good as we get for a situation comedy but its still a bit disappointing and offensive actually let me talk about that for a second i usually wont complain too much about content in films as i see a lot of films with dark or questionable content but was especially disgusting it did not pull any punches with a hard r rating and uses every four letter word you can think of and on top of it all shows the audience two pictures of fully erect penises i didnt see either of those moments coming and they were at least five to ten seconds each not something i thought id see that evening overall is funny and will likely do well at the box office but its not feminist and its not something ill likely watch again,comedy
i really really like this movie because its hilariously funny the funny scenes are nonstop from the beginning until the end the laughter of the audiences from the movie theater could be heard across the hall since the movie is greatly funnythe story is simple and easy to guess but the action scenes and the acting of the actors especially melissa mccarthy are awesome thumb up for the director the writer and all the staffs for this movie they deserve itits been quite long since i can find a very funny movie that can keep me laughing from the beginning until the end well maybe except for charlie mortdecai which is also funny but not as great as this one this movie is more onto my type,comedy
is another appalling outing from melissa mccarthy and paul feig the actor and director also made ghostbusters which i had the misfortune to watch and quickly forget about afterwards this ones a broad what else spoof in which mccarthys character goes from office worker to superin the space of an hour its another mix of mindless cliche and supposedly sharp dialogue between the principal characters dialogue which just offers crudity without wit mccarthys foulmouthed lead is consistently unfunny and randomly goes from bumbling buffoon in the first hour to genuine superat the climax with the copious aid of a stunt double of course miranda hart is embarrassingly bad as the sidekick while other actors are wasted i only watched this for jason statham whos amusing enough riffing on his action man persona but hes not enough,comedy
first 5 minutes quite promising next 20 minutes  extremely dire profanity crude imagesbodily function jokes etc etc remaining 1 hour and 34 minutes  enjoyable as i switched it offive indicated spoiler as i can only assume that those who would rate this style of movie highly to warrant the current 71 out of 10 rating would relish the content and find it really entertainingin its defence i suppose we do need movies like this if only to set the benchmark for low quality,comedy
the plot as all onfield cia names are breached after the assassination of bradley fine by bulgarian arm dealer rayna boyanovthe cia analyst susan cooper who has spent her entire career as desk jockey wrangles her way into her ist undercover assignment to help capture rayna the movie has some good action sequence and some good laugh out scene because of melissa mccarthy of course a good comic actor but jason statham has come over and top to her as he totally nailed each every scene when he is on the screen with his comic timing and his dialogs which does not feel cheesy but feels new fresh and charming whenever he comeshe totally knockout all out of the park even the conversation between jason and melissa character he should have some more screen space as i want more of him and if he had then it will be mind blowing melissa mccarthy is good as usual with other cast jude law and rose byrne are ok in their role but jason statham has totally surprised me the only issue is it has similar plot that each and every movie has i am gonna give b ie 7510 to this action comedy crime muvi,comedy
finally a movie that entertains with both action and comedy has arrived giving us a parody of the great films in recent years starting with a credit tribute to james bond and moving on to several set pieces that lovingly and hilariously recreate the famous thrillers of the past a cia worker who has supported a for many of his missions suddenly sees herself on the other side as she volunteers to help recover a nuclear weapon from the wrongs hands for years she has shown plenty of smarts in front of the computer screen now she must go in the field and demonstrate she is an asset there toosusan mccarthy resents the fact her superior and colleagues dont see anyone else but a desk person she also cringes when she is given identities which remind others of what a loser she is supposed to be eventually she is able to prove herself handy with deadly weapons and quite resourceful in other areas as the mission unfolds she sees herself surrounded by double spies assassins her life put in danger by some of the people she is supposed to be working with in a hilarious race through the streets of rome and its a marvel to see how even some the of the sexy moves made by either her or her italian counterpart are well quite believable theres plenty of colorful language and this might put off some members of the audience but its a rough world and in truth the expressions are not as crude as some of the ramblings we have heard in other stupid movies which pass as comedy nowadays some of the expressions come in during moments of frustration or disgust as some of the actions by the enemy and they dont impede the enjoyment of the filmmccarthy has plenty of chemistry with most of the cast as she confronts byrne spoiled daughter cannavales smooth villain interacts with stratham goofy rebel and laws suave shes sharp in the delivery of her lines and her timing is always perfect and on the spot as she must deal with the obstacles both her enemies and colleagues put in front of herit is really amazing how the balance is kept between the thrills and the laughs she is dealing both with danger and awkward moments she must field attacks with knives and bullets as adroitly as she has to defend her choices in attire the screenplay cleverly addresses how the cia believes she must be prepared and its a riot to see what type of package she is given to survivei loved how the film takes us through different locales much like james bond or the mission impossible series does this film improves on both as we dont have to deal with moody and taciturn heroes or villains theres no wasted time here its a kill or be killed world and theres no time for more than just a couple of quick returns by way of clever remarksgo out and enjoy these actors who have created new personas which will forever influence how we will view the next generation of films much like mad max fury road has set new standards for apocalyptic entries,comedy
i remember some of the greatest performances like richard pryor in stir crazy and eddie murphy in the beverly hills cop movies once you turn loose these comic legends the viewer cant stop watching them melissa mccarthy has that same explosive comic ability her ability to adlib and response to what she sees in a scene and what someone says to her is amazing she has a beautiful angel face to go along with that devil like smile and wit is one of the best comedy performances i seen in my 60 years thanks to the director for bringing together a great dramatic cast to play off of melissas comedy performance i hope they can come up with more material in the future to maximize her talents,comedy
this feminist version of 007 james bond might lack of originality on its first place but the outstanding chemistry and performance from the cast unexpectedly turn it into an entertaining film to enjoy director paul feig has turned both melissa mccarthy and jason statham from their usual annoying and heroic characters to something surprising added with intense woman empowered violence comprehensive actions hilarious and silly adults dialogues as well as unpredictable story line twisting have generated infectious laughter from the beginning till the end while mccarthy spreads her comic showcase extremely well her screen time together with rose byrne are genuinely funny and impressive thanks to the compelling relationships crafted between both of them even though its antagonistic in nature the film sounds ridiculous but the act of balancing the line between being a comedy and an action thriller that allow colorful characters development without any boundaries have overall qualified the film for another sequel,comedy
2015 follows a deskbound cia analyst the unsung hero behind some of the agencys most important missions who volunteers to go undercover in order to infiltrate the world of a deadly arms dealer and in doing so prevent a global disasterafter having seen tammy i was done with melissa mccarthys comedy she was great in bridesmaids good in the heat and an absolute train wreck in tammy there seemed to be this negative linear relationship where as time passed the quality of her comedy decreased then along came and im right back in her camp for me this movie didnt necessarily rejuvenate her comedy career rather it changed my perception of her as a comedy actor for the better shes quite funny in this and while theres the expected fat joke sprinkled here and there doesnt rely on them to be funny in fact its better off without them it depends more on the talented cast which includes jason statham rose byrne and jude law as well as on how director paul feig uses themnot only does feig show us he can do comedy but that he can do action as well which makes me very excited for his upcoming ghostbusters reboot the fine balance between the two genres make one of the years must seejason statham plays the character youd expect jason statham to play you know hes badass but did you know that hes funny because he is this guy is flat out hysterical easily the highlight of the film ok maybe not easily but im telling you this guy steals every scene hes in theres this monologue for instance that he goes off on that had me literally gasping for air i laughed so hard that tears were actually forming around my eyesthis movie certainly lives up to its r rating its violent therere a ton of fbombs and theres brief male frontal nudity the actual story is pretty clichd youve seen it before many times and while the second half felt quite saturated with onenote characters and explicit language is a movie thats guaranteed to make you laugh,comedy
a film which probably features the most generic title a movie could have the trailer really didnt excite or appeal to me melissa mccarthy to me used to be hilarious she was somebody who was new and everybody loved but for every film like bridesmaids which i really like we got something along the lines of tammy and i was starting to get sick of her but this film really made me like her again because it is a film that was hilarious and badass at the same time and a film that melissa mccarthy really shone in as the lead rolefollows susan cooper mccarthy who is a deskbound cia operative working with top agent bradley fine played by jude law the first thing to note is that mccarthy does a really good job at being this shy woman who keeps herself to herself but then when she gets out on the field becomes an actual badass and is a delight to watch along the way she is aided by specialist agent rick ford played by a hilarious jason statham in what i believe is his first comedy statham steals every scene he is in with his bumbling character and gives the film half of its r rating i mean seriously every scene he is in he is swearing and shouting his lines out with such quality that you really cannot see another actor playing this role and i believe he should be given more comedy roles the two work to stop the plans of raina another great performance by rose byrne who provides a good contrast to melissa mccarthy in terms of personalityeverybody in the cast was so well casted and this also applies to miranda hart who i was surprised would be in a paul feig film feig loves to work with women and miranda hart is one of the funniest working in britain she provides comic relief in a film which really doesnt need comic relief because it is a comedy itself but surprisingly it actually works i do like paul feigs previous work i wasnt so on board with the heat which was more in the vein of this film but to me this one is better maybe ghostbusters just might be in safe handsin the end entertained me as a film it entertained me as a comedy and it entertained me as a film in general great cast and a good plot with unexpected twists and turns along the way melissa mccarthy and jason statham especially gave it their all and succeeded im entertaining the hell out of us so to me thats what matters most just to warn people expecting a lighthearted comedythis is very violent and oddly bloody at times but as a movie fan i enjoyed myself a lot and if youre a fan of either genre you will too melissa mccarthy has got her mojo back,comedy
temporarily reassigned as a field agent a desk job cia agent becomes unexpectedly embroiled in a bomb smuggling plot in this energetic james bond spoof starring melissa mccarthy and jason statham in a golden globe nominated role mccarthy is surprisingly quite effective very mildmannered and never quite selfassured or at least until she goes undercover and has a chance to assert herself her hurt and downtrodden facial expressions are a true reminder of the acting potential she showed in st vincent with trademark crudeness pushed aside statham impresses even more than mccarthy though in a tailormade role designed to parody his own tough guy image always rambling on about ridiculous career achievements and utterly indignant when told that a faceoff machine does not actually exist the film tends to often go for easy laughs though with loud crass humour of the grossout variety there is an eyerolling bit in which mccarthy vomits on a corpse and none of her vocal vulgarities when pretending to be a hardened bodyguard are especially funny the jokes work at least half the time though and the parts that are funny are very very funny the bond parody stuff is very much on the mark too with excellent 007 stylised opening credits including a memorable theme song and some unexpected q department gadgetry of sorts 50 cent also has a fun cameo and among the films secondary supporting players jude law shows that he could in fact be the next james bond while allison janney is amusing as the not easily amused cia director,comedy
star rating  saturday night  friday night  friday morning  sunday night  monday morning susan cooper melissa mccarthy works behind a desk at the command centre of the fbi but has a solid working relationship with top bradley fine jude law until he is killed in the line of duty determined to do something of meaning after the death of her friend susan volunteers to be part of an undercover operation to thwart a major arms sale with agent ford jason statham whos not quite as suave and sophisticated as he thinks he is it puts her on a collision course with bradleys killer the ice cold rose rayna boyanov but nothing is as clear as it seemscomedy director paul feigs latest offering seemed to have made more of an impact on its dvd release than its cinema one where it appeared to have slipped by the radar like many films these days there seems to be a pretty even split between the positive and negative reviews when the truth is its a real in between offering weirdly over ambitious and wanting to go beyond the confines of a simple comedy for simple laughs it does its job pretty well but lets itself down by going on far too long developing an overly elaborated twisty turny plot and an uneven tonecast wise in the lead role mccarthy fits in to another comedy persona beginning as a pretty sweet unassuming underdog before transforming into the feisty foul mouthed act shes known for as the story progresses and the script requires it brit miranda hart pops up as her work colleague and friend and isnt surprising at all just being the same persona from her tv show shes just there and youll either like her or loathe her as such meanwhile statham simply doesnt have the demeanour or tone to fit a comedy role even if he is poking fun at himself while boyanov is just a little too cold and ruthless for such a light role how much law was paid for such minimal screen time and minimal effort doesnt bear thinking aboutthis is really just a curious mess of a comedy part spoof part comedy in its own right with a dash of something that wants to be a serious addition to the series for a few simple laughs though its fine if youre in the right mood ,comedy
i was lucky enough to get a set of tickets from tinder of all places this movie did not disappoint nothing was really revealed in the trailers so the real story was a surprisethe story was very good the characters were well written and delivered and melissa mccarthy was hilarious melissa is a comedic genius id watch anything shes in after this hands down rose byrne and jude law played their characters so well the scene stealer was 100 jason statham whos macho better than you attitude made me crack up every timemy favorite line was delivered by melissa mccarthy after her initial character reveal about an family members preferences i wont say much more than that but i say it out loud and start to laugh hystericallyvery good movie its a must watch summer film,comedy
is one of these movies that has some blockbuster attributes cast production and it didnt justified its high expectations of the story and scriptat the beginning i thought it was a film of the cartoon series archer since it has the same story and characters archer is obviously an inspitation for this film apparently there is no other connectionas a whole failed to travesty the movie clichs of the scenario even the unforeseen and sarcastic jokes where far from original and it ended up with three good scenes  one of them pretty hilarious actuallyif you like archer you dont have to see this at all,comedy
move over james bond the coolest in town is the cias susan cooper a rotound desk agent who looks and walks like melissa mccarthy that is given her first field assignment to stop a bulgarian arms dealer rayna rose bryne from selling a rogue nuclear weapon to the highest bidding terrorist while her textbook suave male counterparts get to don tuxedos and hide behind cool aliases susan gets assigned to be a divorced motherofthree from iowa or a single woman living with ten cats in her apartment clearly she isnt who you would normally associate with material but hey thats precisely why writer director paul feigs sendup of the genre is so so funnythe official synopsis will let you know that susan is called upon to assist the agency when her assigned field agent bradley fine jude law is killed in the call of duty by rayna the latter also threatening to know and therefore kill every single active field agent of the agency has so from her vermininfested basement where she acts as the eyes and ears for bradley susan volunteers her anonymous self for a track and report only mission in paris where rayna is supposed to meet with a notorious middleman named deluca bobby cannavale needless to say the enthusiastic former desk jockey steps out of the mission parameters very quickly and throws herself right into the thick of the action globetrotting across europe to rome and finally to budapest in order to track down the missing nukeas far as spoofs go is surprisingly wellplotted instead of a catfight between mccarthy and bryne feig has them form somewhat of an unlikely friendship somewhere during the middle act as mccarthy pretends to be a bodyguard hired by brynes father to protect the latter watching brynes snobbish judgmental reyna trade verbal barbs at mccarthys inyourface expletivehurling susan is a hoot and their chemistry is even more delightful than discovering that susan has an inner rage that makes her one hell of a mean fighter in the first place ditto it is to find out that statham isnt just rehashing his action hero persona from the countless bgrade movies hes been of late but instead sending it up by constantly exaggerating the things he has had to endure in the line of duty like having to cut one arm off and sew it back with the otherfrom its james bondstyle title sequence there is no doubt that feig has his tongue firmly in his cheek and yet unlike other send ups feig plays his with a thoroughly straight face and comes off all the better for it at no point does it come off looking silly just look at austin powers as a counterfactual quite the opposite you might even be inclined at several points to call it brilliant which only goes to show just how deftly feig has managed the fine balance between farce and genius like his past two female centric comedies that genius lies also in feigs gleeful lack of regard for political correctness so those who cannot stand the pottiness of bridesmaids or the heat should know that this is likely to offend your delicate sensibilities as wellyet if theres something these previous feigmccarthy collaborations have shown it is that theirs is truly an inspired comedic pairing it was feig who first introduced us to mccarthys foulmouthed attitude in bridesmaids but as identity thief and tammy showed her trademark shtick can get tiresome and ingratiating very quickly without the right finesse feig knows exactly how far and when to push the right buttons so that mccarthys outward bravado never gets on your nerves more than in her previous roles there is palpable sense of insecurity to mccarthys fishoutofwater character here and the highly gifted comedic actress delivers her most heartfelt performance portraying susans anxieties as she realises how way out of her league she isin place of the ensemble in bridesmaids or the complement that sandra bullock was in the heat feig surrounds mccarthy with a colourful cast of supporting characters statham and law have a whale of a time with their winking performances the former as a toughtalker and the latter as a debonair who isnt so perfect heck he accidentally kills the one man with the information he needs when he squeezes the trigger while sneezing bryne is gloriously bitchy and like we said earlier her scenes with mccarthy snap crackle and pop other no less entertaining additions include miranda hart who plays mccarthys colleague down in the basement that harbours similar dreams of being out there in the action her ideal codename being amber valentine no less as well as british actor peter serafinowicz who plays an amorous local cia handler enlisted to help mccarthy while she is in rome feig juggles all these distinct characters beautifully while never ever forgetting that this is mccarthys show through and throughif youre looking to be tickled silly we guarantee that will leave you in stitches but the real ingenuity in this espionage spoof is how it is never in itself silly indeed its humour lies not in putting down its characters or by extension its actors but rather by subverting our stereotypes of just who and how certain people are supposed to be it is precisely because we do not expect someone of mccarthys calibre to be a secret agent that we laugh at how wrong we were  and yes contrary to what you may expect mccarthy does get to kick ass a lot of them the same goes for each one of her other costars whose characters are deliberately meant to be counterintuitive but hey one can say precisely the same about which easily surpasses what feig and mccarthy have done before it is funny as hell all right and it even has a genuinely exciting story in itself,comedy
a pleasant surprise was sitting down to this moviethe premise is a tried and tested one weve all seen the comedy beforeso what sets this one apart from the restwell because this one is actually quite funnysure this is mainly down to the seasoned comedy skills of lead melissa mccarthy and miranda hart but suprisngly it is action star jason statham that steals the showstatham only crops up every now and again but when he does he owns every scene hes inthe plot like aforementioned is one thats been done beforeexpert spies have to rely on underdog to save the day as their identities have been breached and theres the generic big bomb that needs to be retrieved so its up to unknown and untested cia analyst mccarthy to go undercoverpaul feigs film manages to sustain the laughs and this is partially due to his excellent cast all getting fully onboard with the hilarity and having a good time making this crowd pleasing comedythe hero is only as good as their villain and rose byrne is both beautiful and hilarious to beholdher rapport with mccarthy helps drive the movie but when the film does begin to stall up pops statham sending the film back into overdrivetheres good support from jude law who would have probably made a very good james bondperhaps he could fill daniel craigs shoes when hes done with the roleaction and wit is a plenty here and the cameo from the normally wooden 50 cent is another highlight to this bright and bushy comedy rompi wasnt a fan of paul feigs ghostbusters reboot which also starred melissa mccarthy but id definitely pay to see 2,comedy
we need someone to follow de luca without being detected susan cooper mccarthy works for the cia but not in a position she wants she helps agents in the field by monitoring monitors when something goes wrong on a mission the entire company is compromised susan is the only one that can go in undetected what started off as a intel mission only becomes dangerous and susan is the only one that can stop the threat i am a pretty big melissa mccarthy fan although i think her character is getting a little played out i said after tammy that she maybe only has 1 or 2 more movies left where she plays the same type before it gets old i was wrong this is the one movie too many im not saying this is a bad movie because i did laugh quite a bit but the jokes didnt seem original and this just felt tired and forced statham was actually pretty funny in this but was very underused there isnt really a whole lot to say about this other than that overall a standard mccarthy movie that is starting to lose it magic worth seeing but im glad i didnt pay theater prices for it i give it a b,comedy
i like melissa mccarthy but i wasnt looking forward to this movie in the slightest i was dragged into seeing this one and i was pleasantly surprised by it but i dont quite get what all the fuss is about some of the jokes ive already seen in the heat and the presence of 50 cent is entirely unnecessary but there were also some jokes that were just plain awkward such as a gag involving a camera and even a vomit joke that was really gross and dumb i did laugh out loud in the theater a few times but not every joke hit for me jason statham was hilarious in but i felt that mccarthy was making some tired jokes about fatness and some dialogue that was already used in other comedies id say watch something way funnier like the heat or movies in theatres right now such as minionswhich i laughed hard at throughout in the theater i wont say this is a bad choice i laughed at some parts and the action is cool but its just your typical american comedy with fart jokes and fat guylady slapstick overall is funny but overrated watch age of ultron san andreas or minions if you want actionpacked and funny entertainment,comedy
if i hadnt watched the trailer i wouldve probably enjoyed the moviejason statham played his part really well but when i see a melissa mccarthy movie it must be at least on par or better that the heati still regard the heat as one of my favourite comedy movies its right up there with superbad for me both of which i hadnt heard anything about before watchingto sum things up watch the heat if you havent alreadyeverybody has their own taste and sense of humour when it comes to comedy and i think the moment and mood you are in at the time is everything,comedy
star studded line up made this comedy very funny if you want to just relax on a sunday with a kid from hockey after a night out this is the film to watch great quotes from melissa and jason keep you entertained for the 2 hours this film is a mix between james bond and keeping up with the kardashians it has plenty of comedy and a few fight scenes that really get the blood flowing melissa mc was on point with her acting as was jude and jason it was good to see the token english actress miss hart make an appearance as english bbc actress get very little work in hollywoodwill definitely recommend to my other one friend,comedy
im surprised at all the 1s and 2s and scathing reviews here im guessing these people have never actually seen a truly bad movie if theyre rating this one so low a 5 if you didnt like it this i understand but a 1 or a 2 i guess you havent seen boggy creek 2 or son of the maski dont even like comedy im not a fan of watching fat people act either i went into this expecting to be bored and regretting watching it that didnt end up being the case at all the actors all did a great job i thought the movie was hilarious and i was laughing out loud from beginning to end,comedy
rightat first  i was skeptical of this movie as im not a big fan of mellissa mccarthy  and i was not looking forward too it not even remotely  when i got to see it  i was treated with a very pleasant surprise  this is hilariousit is filled to the brim of humorous moment and great oneliners  and i must say  it looks like every single member of the cast is having a fantastic time jude law seems like he is living his dream mellissa mccarthy is justmelissa mccarthy jason staham he should seriously play this role for the rest of his life everyone seems to be having the time of their lives  and hey even 50cenf showed up for the laughwith brilliantly orchestrated fight scenes and jokes that will have you falling of your chair  i think this might even be on par with the kingsmanfinal verdict 810,comedy
melissa mccarthy is a pretty gal and its great to see her in a movie that allows her attractiveness to come through there is nothing like a good movie with plenty of action  and then throw in humor perfect and as i mentioned the main thing wrong with this film was the overabundance of lousy language it really does show nothing more than a lack of creativity on the part of the writers seriously you have to resort to throwing around the f word in every sentence rather than come up with some clever dialogue and toss in a bunch of crude socalled humor instead of thinking up something not bordering on juvenile bathroom typehumor i dont think so clean up the next one bring back melissa and jude law togetherthey have great chemistryand they are terrific with the action moves both of them then have allison janney stick around as the boss lady and youve got a series of good movies ahead for us,comedy
comedy  action movie reminds of kingsman the secret service  just the has 10 times less action did i get bored during the movie no it was predictable but not always  there were some surprises movie was meant to be funny but some jokes were rude and offensive i felt like they tried to make every minute of the movie as a joke disappointed after the end scene  what the hell was that and why did you just get bored of filming the movie gave up and showed us some unrelated peace from the movie 2 or maybe i just didnt get it after all the movie is not bad great actors some funny jokes and few minutes of action  good for watching after a long day at work,comedy
i was frankly not very interested in watching because i had the feeling it was going to be a female version of the atrocious paul blart mall cop or something like that but after having read many positive reviews about it i decided to risk myself and the result ended up being better than i expected even though the general reaction this movie provoked on me can be described as meh the main attribute from is the solid performance from melissa mccarthy who was able to create a realistic and detailed character elevating the film and making the predictable jokes work better than what the insipid screenplay would deserve however that occasionally generates a marked inconsistency in scenes which start as a comedy and end as weak drama incompatible with the fish outside the water humorous routines in other words director and screenwriter paul feig wasnt able to balance the comedy formula with the serious elements i think i would have preferred to be a lighter and more accessible action comedy or an espionage movie which takes itself seriously without losing its sense of humor the problem is that never defines its purpose and attempts to be two things at the same time without being very satisfactory in either of both aspects however as i previously said the main thing which makes moderately entertaining despite its mediocrity is mccarthys performance as a comedienne she displays spark and warmth and as an action heroine shes simultaneously incongruent and credible and despite the fact that they werent given very substantial material to work with i also liked the performances from jason statham rose byrne and miranda hart i think that with a more precise focus and a less generic story i barely paid attention to the affair of the bombs the terrorists etc would have been quite a competent espionage film but the addition of comedy elements alters the centre of gravity of the screenplay provoking an instability which substantially affects the film on the other hand i dont know whether the general audience would accept mccarthy as an action figure without the extenuating factor of comedy it seems unfair to think like that but reality isnt fair and hollywood reality doesnt even know that word thats why we ended up seeing chris hemsworth playing a geek hacker this year,comedy
melissa mccarthy always rocks the movies where she usually plays funny roles in because she is the best at that for her sense of humor and the way she emphasizes things to make it even funnier i saw this movie right when it came out and i left the theatre pretty pleased based on what i had seen melissa mccarthy is one of my favorite hilarious actresses which was the main reason on why i saw she had some funny and amusing roles in this movie which made added jazz to the movie with her silly funny antics she had done in this film i enjoyed how she was portrayed and the way she was portrayed as in her character and her lines melissa goes beyond just acting the lines she emphasizes and makes her lines funnier on the way she expresses and emphasizes them to make them funnier and spectacular for the audiences hearing the whole cast had funny roles and in a way that related to hers which made it a night at the theatre worth my while,comedy
not expecting much probably helped when i watched this film i think it was the extendeduncut version or at least i presume shots of a realisticlooking penis didnt appear in the cinema release but it was more fun than i expected it to bethe main issues i seemed to have with it mostly related to it being the extended version because it was longer than the light touch could sustain likewise the film was far too crude for its own good although this felt like the uncut version trying to justify its tag and get those extra sales otherwise though the film is enjoyable for never worrying about taking itself too seriously it is silly and makes no sense but is fun for itthe cast are a big part of this throwing themselves into it i kept waiting to get tired of mccarthy but mostly she was funny  again only the more uncut material which didnt work as well miranda is good in support but it is statham that stands out as he sends himself up and has great timing the cast is probably too heavy with wellknown faces  even in tiny roles youll find comedians from various shows such as the office and veep still it worksnot a standout comedy but silly and funny enough to make it work,comedy
susan cooper melissa mccarthy is an unassuming desk bound cia analyst and the unsung hero behind the agencys most dangerous missions but when her partner jude law falls off the grid and another top agent jason statham is compromised she volunteers to go deep undercover to infiltrate the world of a deadly arms dealer and prevent a global disastertook the family husband 15 yr old son and 2 x 13 yr olds to see this m plus rated movie think james bond spoof i wondered if i was displaying bad parent behaviour by showing them a movie that clearly expressed there was violence swearing and nudity in it in my eyes the humour factor far outweighed the above we all thought it was very funny and the one liners throughout the movie are well placed more along the lines of an english comedy its silly and fun and will make you laugh yes their is violence but can we call it ridiculous unbelievable violence that cant be taken seriously nudity a nano second of an appendage or two loads of the f word and reverence to body parts yes it probably was a little south of the cartoon south park and family guy but if youre open minded and accepting that the kids hear all this in the schoolyard go and have a laugh all the actors are well cast and everyone in our family and in the theatre walked out of the theatre with a big smile on their faces thumbs up for a silly funny ridiculous james bond spoof,comedy
there are some pretty bad reviews going around for this latest melissa mccarthy flick so i didnt go with any great expectations but it was surprisingly funny mccarthy has finally found a vehicle that allows her to carry a film unlike her previous bombs tammy identity thief and the heat this movie put her in funny situations without being outright mean about her size yes there are lots of jokes about how difficult it would be for a fat out in the field but at the end of the day the whole point of the movie is that she actually knows how to handle herself and shes a terrific despite her size and shes pretty handy in a fight especially armed with a cast iron skillettheres also a great supporting cast around her particularly englands miranda hart playing well miranda from her tv series jason statham and rose byrne both play caricatures but are still funny nonethelessit was actually a fun movie with plenty of laughsincidentally its rated ma15 for a reason so to the couple in front who took their 10 year old daughter along what were you thinking the cbomb was used at least once theres a brief glimpse of a woman giving a blow job on a darkened parisian street completely gratuitous and the fbomb was liberally used throughout the movie especially by the rose byrne character who was a real potty mouth this is not a comedy to take the kids along to,comedy
i went to see this movie on the premier as a surprise and didnt know what i was walking in to when i saw melissa mccarthy i feared it would one of her sub par comedies but this was an epic hilarious clever and keeping the thrill going until the end and yes jason statham was incredibly entertaining the movie exaggerated many social taboos and oddities we experience every day we all feel the same but dare not say it aloud this movie says a lot of our inner thoughts aloud its good to finally a see a good comedy out there the cast is amazing the jokes are fun there is a lot of cursing but it all falls in to place maybe i am underrating it by giving it a 7 instead of an 8,comedy
the problem with this film is that both the star and director made it under the misapprehension that swearing a lot is funny by itself so have therefore seemingly dispensed with putting any effort in when it comes to actually constructing comedic scenes and delivering punchlines relying on famous faces saying fuck every five seconds loses any impact quite quickly and stops being funny soon after that said jason statham sends his hard man persona up quite nicely and the film picks up whenever his on screen but its little and far betweenthe film is also extremely violent for a comedy  with several minor characters suffering quite horrendous wounds and deaths in the name of fun having a character suffer multiple gun shot wounds stabbing a woman in the hand and having a man have his throat melt after drinking acid may be funny to director paul feig but he doesnt have the skill nor the competence to handle tom  jerry violence and misjudges the tone of the film completely is someone throwing up on a dead man really the height of comedyfinally their is an underlying tone of racism offensive italian stereotypes racist language etc throughout that arguably leaves a worst taste in the mouth than the aforementioned acid,comedy
is an action comedy starring melissa mccarthy and jason statham and it does a pretty damn good job at blending comedy with action the action scenes were entertaining and accompanied with some subtle comedy as well as some over the top comedy it really made the last 34 of this film fun the first 1520 minutes wasnt that great it was setting up characters and the main plot and although it had a few laughs it was quickly losing my interest and there were one or two more times where it was showing signs of losing it but in comes jason statham to save the day because he was by far the highlight of this film who knew an action star would be the funniest aspect of a melissa mccarthy led comedy film i personally am not a giant fan of her but she has proved to be able to carry a film with her comedy before so i was surprised when statham completely stole the show time and time again as for the plot it was a fun ride there were times where it got a little silly but overall i was engaged in what was going and they did a good job one issue with the plot is that similar to focus there were just too many twists they were doing a good job at keeping me interested without the twists and the constant surprises got a little dumb but its just a fairly minor flawthe performances were almost all good and although the characters were a little cartoony the film was aware of that so it made it ok melissa mccarthy jason statham rose byrne they all did a good job and were pretty funny but man miranda harts her character was just not good at all whenever she was in the film i wanted her out as soon as possible and she kept on showing up making me sigh every time her character was way too over the top and not funny at all could have definitely done without her in terms of comedy in the end it has its fair share of action and comedy and an interesting plot after the first 15 minutes so you can have a pretty fun time watching this film  76,comedy
is a refreshing movie to see as actioncomedy movies are not the kind of movies that i frequently dabble into yes the whole movie is clearly a parody right off the bat susan cooper melissa mccartney an overweight middleaged woman that works a desk job in the cia headquarters volunteers to be a field agent after her partner brad fine jude law was assassinated angry and upset because she holds a candle for fine susan wants to prove her worth to the cia and avenge fines death and guess what she does a bloody good job to everyones surprise as she is constantly seen as an underdog due to her weight during her mission to track down rayna rose bryne she crosses paths with fellow agent rick ford jason statham who keeps interfering with her mission because he insists on doing things his own wayis a funny movie every moment of the film is laced with humor however some of the jokes strike the jackpot while some fall flat profanities also tend to overboard so people who do not appreciate foul language and crass jokes should steer away from this movie comedy asides i highly enjoy the action and goose chase in this movie the action combats are brutal and violent but interesting and well executed which strikes resemblance to kingsman the secret service susan cooper sprints shoots and fights like a martial expert and kicks some serious ass which is out of norm for someone her stature seeing susan in action ignites roars and laughter throughout the cinema the kitchen fight scene is one of the funniest scenes of the film is filmed across many exquisite locations including paris rome and budapest providing beautiful backdrops for the film and serve as eye pleasers for the audience melissa mccarthy definitely commands the show with her huge presence literally and figuratively as an unconventional notyourtypical agent she is unfit untrained and does not fitlook the part her transition from boring analyst who acts behind the scenes to an aggressive and skillful field agent is a delight to watch she eliminates her enemies with apparent ease and dexterity and goes undercover like a pro with a change of style and believable lies jason statham plays his first comedic role in this movie he is extremely entertaining and surprisingly funny as boastful and annoying agent rick ford who in reality isnt as invincible nor competent as he claims to be he delivers his lines in a deadpan manner but those lines are golden it is such a change from the usual stern characters that he plays fords head butts and constant clashes with cooper are perhaps the most best parts of the film jude law has a shorter screen time due to his early demise but his prowess and charm is undeniable rose bryne also breaks out of her usual character roles as rayna boyanov the villain in which she gives an average performance miranda hart provides a great supporting role to mccartney as best friend nancy and the duo share much comical banter together i can understand why may be a hit or miss due to its overbearing jokes but it is more of a hit in my part it is insane hilarious and actionpacked there are also twists and turns that you wouldnt expect that gives in to the element of surprise enjoy this funfilled movie with a very unlikely hero that saves the day,comedy
quickie reviewone of the finest spies of cia is killed in the line of duty susan cooper melissa mccarthy a cia analyst must now abandon her desk job and go into the field this unassuming s mission to infiltrate an arms dealing ring to prevent a global disaster is a surprisingly good action comedy the movie does not just rely on the only comedian in the movie and is more of an ensemble effort spoofs the genre without becoming a joke itself but this also means that the originality in this movie is severely lacking nevertheless is an entertaining film with consistent stream of laughs as a bonus jason statham was incredible in his comedic rolefull reviewi really was not looking forward to melissa mccarthy was hilarious in bridesmaids but every movie after that was mccarthy becoming more and more extreme version of that character tammy was the peak of annoying comedy it was getting tiring however in mccarthy holds back on the zany weirdness and it workswhen looking at the premise its easy to think oh this movie is just going to be a collection of scenes where mccarthys character fumbles into success quite the contrary she is actually competent at her job yea sure for the physical action she is limited but she holds her own even against intimidating foes what im trying to say is that she is not like austin powers who depends on dumb luck to beat the bad guy she is constantly underestimated so when she exudes confidence thats when mccarthy is at her best because so many times she would retort with actions or insults that were such good burns that you cant help it but laugh rest of the cast were also comedically on point rose byrne continues to show she fits well in comedies even after bridesmaids and neighbors i want to see her more in these types of roles im not just saying that because i have a celebrity crush on her the undeniable show stealer was jason statham his numerous endless monologues about how great he is were hilarious its great to see him poke fun at his own image in action movies its completely unexpected the trailer only gave a snippet but every time statham started one of his stories everyone in the cinema started to laughthere are some tired out jokes in the movie though like i mentioned mccarthys character is constantly put down for her weight or appearance so the jokes about her weight and lack of experience start to get a little old luckily like i mentioned she does quip back in a funny way each time but lessening the fat jokes wouldve been better is a spoof of all movies ever made with that comes all the overused plot points and twists that wont surprise you at all on parody scale of austin powers to kingsman lies somewhere in between so a lot of the parody is done with very safe jokes in that sense doesnt offer anything new or fresh as a result the movie does come off very genericthat being said is a comedy after all so all it needed to do was to get us to laugh and it did achieve its goal you dont need to be concerned of mccarthy wackiness from tammy this was an ensemble effort where the movie depended on everyone in the cast to deliver the jokes is a surprisingly entertaining film that will hit you on the funny bone,comedy
watching melissa mccarthy growing into the role of one of the best comedians working today has been both pleasurable and painful after toiling away in minor film and television roles since the late 1990s she finally broke through at the beginning of this decade with her hit tv sitcom mike  molly and her role in bridesmaids unfortunately breaking through doesnt guarantee a steady stream of onscreen successes mccarthy graduated to leading roles but the movies ranged from profitable if not critically acclaimed to universally panned just look at the list of her 2013 and 2014 films identity thief the hangover part iii the heat tammy and st vincent thats only a twoyear span but includes five releases with big differences in profitability and in quality  both in the film and in her performances that brings us to r 200 with that film being her only liveaction 2015 release  and then as many as four films including the ghostbusters reboot coming out in 2016 mccarthy had a lot riding on in this film mccarthy plays susan cooper a very talented but putupon cia analyst she works in the basement of cia headquarters providing realtime intel to agents in the field  including one very special agent bradley fine jude law cooper would like to be more than the voice in fines earpiece but cant come right out and say it and fine readily acknowledges that he wouldnt be as successful without cooper but thats the extent of their relationship when arms dealer tihomir boyanov raad rawi dies before fine can find out where boyanov has hidden a stolen nuke and fine is himself taken out by boyanovs daughter rayna rose byrne who also reveals that she knows the names of all of the cias field agents cooper offers to go after rayna  to complete fines mission and maybe avenge himnothings easy for cooper in her new role shes given new identities and clothing that the company thinks fits her persona but it all results in an endless string of personal humiliations and jokes at the expense of our intrepid hero in fact it seems that almost no one thinks shes up to the challenge she meets with skepticism from her boss deputy director elaine crocker allison janey with disregard from field agent karen walker morena baccarin and with unmasked contempt by superagent rick ford jason statham ford opposes coopers enhanced status so strongly that he resigns in protest goes rogue and insists on following cooper on her missionthat mission is simply to keep track of rayna and her most likely buyer sergio de luca bobby cannavale to observe and report but when the cias plan goes awry cooper has to improvise she dusts off the skills she gained in her initial training and proves that she can handle the field coopers mission takes her from washington dc to paris to rome and to bulgaria through it all she has the support and encouragement of fellow analyst nancy artingstall miranda hart but also has to endure the lecherous advances of overseas cia contractor aldo peter serafinowicz and the constant interference of ford who is hurting her efforts more than helping them of course this being a movie the story contains numerous surprises twists and turns and doublecrosses and this being a movie of the comedy variety hijinks and humor are plentiful and include various jokes crudities misunderstandings sight gags and a lot of funny moments based in mccarthys trademark selfdeprecationis an aboveaverage comedy which makes good use of its stars settings and setup covert ops proves to be fertile ground for plot points humor and of course some gorgeous scenery the fishoutofwater conceit works well in the hands of mccarthy who seems to get funnier with every film its always great seeing serious dramatic actors like law and statham bring the funny by playing extreme or offbeat versions of the characters that made them famous its also fun to see actors who worked together in previous projects reunite  like mccarthy and byrne 2011s bridesmaids and reallife couple byrne and cannavale appearing together in a third film in less than a year after autumn 2014s annie and spring 2015s adult beginners each member of the cast has great moments  including britains serafinowicz making the most of his biggest american film role to date the story is somewhat predictable but most of the jokes hit their mark and the humor is wellbalanced in type and tone director paul feig who has helmed two previous melissa mccarthy movies bridesmaids and the heat also wrote this one the result is a script with a good story and clever dialog complimented by line delivery and physical comedy from a very talented cast along with consistent and wellpaced directing a,comedy

entertaining easy and funny a perfect movie to just chill with not too hard on the brain no complicated story just a simple laugh for an hour and a half its nowhere near any great comedy but its entertainingnow as a bulgarian woman i need to clarify something in bulgarian language family names of females and males are created as following for females rayna boyanova ends always on a for males chris boyanov ends on v in the movie the name of the female mafia character was rayna boyanov which is common for russian and exsoviet counties bulgaria however is not russia also the comment of rayna about bulgaria being a horrible place full with homeless people is a little bit out of the line bulgaria is a part of the european union and is very far ahead of what they suggested in the movie i think they have mistaken it for moldova or ukraine after the war,comedy
to start off ill say that i have not seen identity thief or tammy which were melissa mccarthys two previous films that i gather did not do so well at the box office i did see bridesmaids on a transatlantic flight and recall laughing so hard at times that other passengers turned to look at me that said bridesmaids was a bit too raunchy for my taste and was missing that certain something that made me really care about the characters i did see the heat and found it serviceable and fun for the moment but once again lacking that certain something to make a film truly enjoyablemccarthys new film has that missing something its funny poignant at times and full of action i cared about mccarthys susan cooper character and wanted to see her complete her mission the potty mouth comes out but it comes out in service of the character and the plot as the story unfolds not just as a cheap device to get some chuckles in previous movies mccarthys characters seems to be rude cantankerous and foulmouthed to the core but here i always felt susan cooper was in firm control of her emotions and brought out that side only when it was needed mccarthy is also aided by a superb supporting cast particularly jason statham as her hilariously over the top rivalthis may be a spoof of movies but it can also be viewed simply as a movie that happens to have a female lead many of the same plot devices are used but as with any movie what matters are the characters and whether or not we care about what happens to them this movie basically ends with the lead and two other supporting characters walking off into the sunset i wanted those three to return for a sequel because they were that funny and that good,comedy
this film is absolutely hilarious it invoked so many laughs and some so strong that i actually teared a few times definitely a must watch if you loved the heat or kingsman which i didnt like in my opinion since i loved the heat this film is on par or even better than that which comes as no surprise seeing as paul feig directed both of them and they both star mccarthythe acting is absolutely amazing and what makes the movie even better are their straight faces during hysterical scenes law and hart give an ok performance as their characters are more secondary however mccarty statham and byrne give an absolutely amazing performance that liven up the atmosphere to a whole other level the lines they spit out  though have too many fbombs manage to erupt the entire theatre with laughsprops to paul feig for both writing and directing this masterpiece of a comedy the jokes are not so trolllike to be eye roll worthy and are not so bland or repetitive to make it stale this was well directed and edited too with the beginning credits looking like something out of a bond filmplus the action scenes were really well done especially for a comedy i wasnt expecting the film to have such great fighting scenes and it was definitely a plus that there was no overexposure of blood and gorein conclusion apart from the many fbombs this is a must see comedy that will leave you laughing till you cryread more movie reviews at championangelswordpresscom,comedy
in addition to being hilariously funny paul feigs is a brilliant feminist response to the james bond genre the opening scene the exotic locales the plot the music the character types all evoke the bonds which spawned a cycle of international bed hopping suave heroes saving the world and the hingeheeled beauties who crave him this female turns all those male clichs into fresh female successesthe title works two ways it obviously declares itself a film but more broadly addresses the male gaze the theory that films assume a masculine perspective and make the female the object of their vision not their own subject as watchers we are the eers the safely ogling the characters from our privileged privacy when we watch we are ing from the traditional male perspective  but here the advantage is given woman susans camera contact lens is an emblem of scopophiliamelissa mccarthys susan cooper is not the genres usual woman but her bulk does not deter her from intelligence stamina energy imagination effectiveness in physical battle and even winning the desire of all the macho men in the film her ample bosom is not maternal but sexy the men by reflex find reasons to grab and ogle it in bonds world shed be boobs galore shes no modesty blaise the lecherous aldos flirtatious routine expresses the emotional attraction both male spies discover for her when she ends up in bed with the ridiculous rick ford she confirms her right to the sexual liberty  even caprice  usually reserved for the male starssusan was inhibited in her early cia career by male authority now she has a chance to fulfil herself as she steps from directing bradley fine by audio remote control to flying into the field herself she fights through every possible restriction she even ploughs her borrowed motorcycle through a furrow of freshly poured concrete  as tough as surviving the cias prejudice against women and the western cultures narrow prescription of feminine beauty susan saves the world saves her beloved bradley wins the career she always craved  but even in her postvictory her new undercover characters remain consigned to boring clichshes also a woman with a voice  as independent aggressive witty profane as any man in that world in fact her rapidfire coarse wit evokes the veep tv series and its clear advantage over the stodgy oldfashioned tomlinfonda warhorse on netflix the substantial wit of the plot is deepened and enhanced by the dialogue which is offthe wall inventive and always funny that extends into the case histories chronicled behind the endcredits stay for them susans blossoming from clerk to action hero contrasts to the other three woman the cia unit director is the familiar woman administrator brusque officious eager to subordinate her women charges to the mens needs susans colleague and best friend nancy a brutally deglamorized miranda hart is a plainjane miss moneypenny who under susans example comes into her own saving susans life killing a villain and even seducing rapper fifty cent thats qualitatively more money than the money penny the cias dazzling perfect beauty proves as false as the genres feminine allure proving herself a traitor our admiration and empathy are invested in the beauty thats conventionally denied the evil rayna is as tough heartless and dangerous as all the bond master villains she is as independent and foulmouthed as susan as worthy an adversary as dr noh and goldfinger like the conventional heroine rayna runs for her life  tottering upon her silted heels the cia director nancy and rayna have an imageconsciousness that underscores susans deeply inculcated  and reductive  humility the male figures also undercut the genre convention the bond figure is suave bradley fine jude law a ladykiller brutally insensitive to susans ardor for him  except to exploit it as rick ford action star jason statham caricatures his persona a macho strutting mysogynous hero who goes rogue to solve the case here he proves absolutely incompetent here this male action star plays the usual female bimbo susan saves both macho heroes and in turn is saved by nancy as ford is a comic exposure of fine susan exposes both thus the film exposes the traditional assumption that men command the proper authority and efficacy in solving the worlds problems that assumption is our cultural bias and weakness not a reality,comedy
is like a funny female version of james bond it was self aware of how stupid and ridiculous it is and it was funnier than expectedmelissa mccarthy delivers the best of her comedic talent in this movie i liked her in bridesmaids which surprisingly got her a nomination at the oscars and the heat but this might be her funniest role to date not only because of paul feigs direction but due to the fact that her character actually does stuff and not act like a silly annoying fat personthe movies pacing was fast and never slow one of the problems in modern comedies is how dragging the pacing and jokes are in this movie they feel refreshing i dont know about you but paul feigs direction of the action scenes are golden for a comedy like this he also pulls off some cool one liners in the scriptamong the best parts of the movie is jason statham having played badasses in the past its nice to see statham play that stereotype in a light and comedic film and goddamn it it worked rose byrne playing the villain was funny as well its almost as funny as her appearance in neighborsdespite a formulaic plot is a moronic fun time at the movies that tickles you with nonstop laughter and filled with entertaining acting from melissa mccarthy jason statham and rose byrne this movie gives you a lot of good vibes go see it specifically for a good time,comedy
this box office hit from last summer currently sports a robust 94 on rotten tomatoes so even my normal aversion to the comedic gruel of paul feig wasnt enough to keep me from hoping for a fun rainy day diversion i was wrong to hopeoffers up a few chuckles and a host of game performances from its talented cast particularly the normally onedimensional buttkicking jason stathem but is otherwise hackneyed and overlong substituting fbombs when wit is lacking which is often i really dont know if im just that out of touch highly highly possible or if the bar for comedy has been lowered that far,comedy
i am not going to say this is a bad movie or a good movie it is one to be forgotten what makes a good movie is not the outcome we know bond bourne even maxwell smart will prevail its the process of what they go through that matters in this movie there is no time you think that melissa mccarthys character  susan cooperis in any real danger she is basically smarter and tougher then everyone else and required no learning curveeven bond had to deal with smarter  dr no and stronger enemies  jaws and had to learn his craft  see casino royale basically it is a chick flick pretending to be an action comedy a few good one liners and action scenes but easily forgettable 5 10 stars,comedy
is it manhating is it misandrypaul feig is not a director i admire i was mostly amused watching bridesmaids i was the only one laughing in the cinema during the screening and the heat bored me to sleep i skipped ghostbusters 2016 after his distaste for fans of that series became apparent but upon watching i have come to the conclusion that this man might actually be disturbed the rampant manhating here is both morbid and clinically fascinatingthe story is a rehashed version of the superior 1985 chevy chasedan aykroyd comedy spies like us with mild aspirations of being a james bondjason bourne parody melissa mccarthy is the underdog desk jockey given a chance at working in the field and she does her best with the messy script i like mccarthy she gets a lot of hate even though shes a talented comedic and dramatic actress but she needs to start distancing herself from paul feigcoherence and pace are thrown out the window in favour of endless tiresome gags at the expense of men and male dignity sorry feig we dont owe you our dignity men built the world and its not for you to portray each and every one of us as a sexual predator moron or an expendable piece of meat of the many many many dead bodies in this film only two are female and the rest are white men feig obviously enjoys killing men but hes not got the moxie to make any of them a shade darkerim so sick and tired of these comedies from the last 15 or so years directed by feig and his peers especially judd apatow that last in excess of 2 hours i find these bloated running times to be arrogant condescending selfimportant and unfocused should have been a 95minute movie its more than half an hour longer than that feig had way too much power here and an editor not afraid to chop it down could have saved it i defy you to properly follow the plot and fully understand what is happening and why there is a very funny however smug movie somewhere in here but its lost in feigs manhating indulgence and his overconfidence of his own screenplaythe hilarious dialogue follows the same single flow for the entire durationcharacter 1 effing effing eff eff yourself eff eff eff something wacky and weird mother eff weirdness effer the eff quirkiness eff yourself effing effcharacter 2 wow thats not normaleven if the above problems were not enough how many times must we have a british tv star pop up in an american movie as an exaggerated stereotype designed to make the yank look cool wonder woman the mummy every character played by hugh grant or stephen merchant c3po etc etc enough is enough miranda hart plays the one role she is seemingly capable of playing wilfully typecasting herself for the disgrace of being in a big budget hollywood moviethe action is of the stuttercut and speedramping variety the cinematography is wide and flat with unnaturally boosted colors and the camera blocking is very televisual there are sitcoms with more grace and fluidity ive had it with feig blake edwards he aint i will never watch another one of his movies and im hoping that his loud misandry and the bomb of ghostbusters 2016 has crippled his ability to make such rotten garbage,comedy
7 june 2015 either melissa mccarthy or the directorscriptwriter paul feig attempted to create a new comedy genre using an hefty female character who also happens to be a good stand up comic and using plenty of rrated live stand comedy acts along with the drunken beer crowd the results of this attempt comes down to a pretty subjective preference for this form of comedy which not everyone i assume really gets off on there have been much more smoother and witty comedic movies such as the ironic dual identity comedy true lies 1994 the comedy duo of mr and mrs smith 2007 the traditionally awkward male of gun shy 2000 the much witty straight guy version wild target 2010 even sandra bullocks performance in miss congeniality 2000 might be a good comedic comparison to contrast with in some ways the script tries too hard to be peter sellers funny but in the more crude sexed up contemporary waywhat would have been even more fascinating and a great career move would have been to have melissa try a serious bruce willis performance as in the whole nine yards 2000 with jude law playing the bumbling super in some ways this movie uses james bond music melodic chords with a parody of large figured woman which only degrades and perpetuates the derogatory image of them instead of bringing a more authentic respect to them or if such a comedic performance was insisted about emulation of pierce brosnans character in the matador 2005 might have offered a more serious challenge to the comedic genre or the female characters in daisy  violet 2011 or john cusack in grosse point blank 1997 the perhaps the best contemporary female comedy movie would be katie holmes character in miss meadows 2014,comedy
this is a fast food movie formulaic writing no surprises the audience is spoonfed the writers probably spent no more than an hour on the script it is pretty much an of the shelf scriptthe acting is over the top and layered like bad plasterwork one finds it hard to believe these are supposed professional actorscontinuity is non existent high heels boots flats all make their appearance in the motorcycle scene on one pair of feetyou could leave the story for 30 minutes and still follow itthis is ideal if you want some background noise for a sunday napwhy 5 rating then well because it is good nap material and because they had 2 or 3 max funny jokes in the movie im just glad i didnt pay to watch it,comedy
is an action comedy movie it makes so much laughing from crowdmccarthy plays susan cooper a cia analyst with as her bossallison janneymelissa mccarthy character was always involved in the best scenes in the film she not just to kills the audience with laughter during entire film but also to kill us with her nice acting skills is an irreverent but not irreverent enoughthe film also would have been more enjoyable if feig didnt expend so much timethe story and situations are ridiculous but what comedy is fineit start good but as story moves it make boring but still it is really funny movie,comedy
i must admit i was not looking forward to this at all i was expecting two hours of lets all point and laugh at the fat girl with some added knob gagsthat isnt too far from the mark it is crude and the main character is picked on quite a lot but is seldom the butt of the jokes in a world of super skinny models and implausible macho tough guys she is obviously the sane one statham and law do a great job of sending up the two hero archetypes the gritty violent hardman and the dashing suave rouge and have great fun with itthe movie does swerve dangerously close to scary movie territory in parts but doesnt ever go all the waythis is good fun the arguments and put downs are ferocious and witty all the characters are sendup stereotypes i did find it got a bit grating at the end as the jokes get piled on a bit heavy  i would have liked it more if it had ended ten minutes earlier i laughed a lot  my girlfriend thought it was a bit silly and the bits i laughed at were childish  but she enjoyed it also,comedy
is a funny movie but it feels like a joke that goes on too long the humor is almost entirely dependent on the improvised dialogue between actors and melissa mccarthy playing the same type of character weve come to expect however its fun to watch a different take on the genre and this movie also features some impressive action scenes plus rose byrne is in it and that never hurts a movie,comedy
there are some funny parts but really not cool what they say about bulgaria not true and very offensive bulgaria is a very beautiful european country people live in their own european looking like apartments and houses there many in other countries cant afford that there are many rich people just like anywhere else and believe me women are very beautiful so this ugly words used in this movie and the horrible image that was created about bulgaria is so untrue and mean such a disappointment lost at least 8 million people of the audience with this script also 33 is the phone code of france not only of paris just to be clear paris is the capital of france but it is not the whole country so doesnt really make sence how they located the destination by the phone code ,comedy
 the greatest disguise a could utilize to go unnoticed by the enemy  is that of a morbidly obese person  unfortunately for the novice agent in this actioncomedy her weight  is not some elaborate getup  when her field agent crush jude law is murdered by rayna rose  byrne a nuclear arms dealer who knows the identity of the cias top  agents desk jockey susan cooper melissa mccarthy volunteers to go on  assignment  sent to paris to tail the buyer bobby cannavale susan is closely  followed by a cocksure agent jason statham who is skeptical the  bumbling amateur has what it takes  despite most of the jokes pertaining to the leads appearance the  overall tone of the films humor is oldfashioned vulgarity with jason  statham playing against type to deliver the best comedic performance of  the bunch  furthermore stout spies are best suited for undercover work at hot dog  eating contests   green light,comedy
its an action comedy with forgettable action scenes and a couple big laughs mixed in with some chuckle worthy lines its alright at best melissa mccarthy does her job just fine her character was always involved in the best scenes in the film and all the laughs she brings isnt from stupid physical comedy for the most part like i said though its alright at best i dont know if its worth watching the entire thing for maybe 2 laugh out loud scenes everything in between that is really forgettable and boring overall i would say this was by no means bad but could have certainly been much much better if you really really like action comedies youll probably have a blast with it everyone else i would expect to say either fine or meh,comedy
this film tells the story of an unlikely heroine in the cia who has enormous success in her first ever field missionits been quite a long time that i laughed so much in the cinema its even more fun when the hundreds of people in the cinema burst into uncontrollable laughter at the same time it gives that synergistic effect on moodthe plot is so funny that you have to watch it to believe it melissa mccarthy is really good but i think the eye opener is jason statham its the first comedic role ive seen him in and he is brilliant he is still super manly and doesnt do silly stuff but he manages to be super funny while being super manly what a balance to strike i truly enjoyed watching its riotously funny,comedy
well i have finally discovered a melissa mccarthy movie that i have actually enjoyed okay i generally dont judge a movie based entirely on the actors  well sometimes i do and considering jason stratham is also in this film and that it is one of those goofy films made me want to go and see it despite mccarthy having the main role and i must admit that she was nowhere near as annoying as she was in some of the other films of hers that i have seenanyway somebody has leaked the identity of all of the cias top agents to a black marketeer who has a nuclear bomb for sale and upon learning this they realise that they need to send somebody onto the field who is a relative unknown which is where susan cooper comes into the picture basically she has a desk job where she provides intelligence to the agents in the field and has been assigned to the agent bradley fine however fine is killed when attempting to infiltrate the hideout of one of his targets but before he is killed the cia are warned not to send their other agentsso cooper decides to volunteer and we already know that she is incredibly good at her job despite the fact that the ops room at the cia has bats in the ceiling and rats running around everywhere in fact it gives us the impression that the cia is quite underfunded and its field operatives are all james bond like characters or testosterone filled action heroes who have little in the brains department particularly since one takes a boat to go on a mediterranean cruise despite the boat being located in a lakeso we have mccarthy travel to some exotic european cities you have to have exotic locations in a movie especially one taking the mickey out of the james bond franchise including paris rome and budapest we also have cooper taking on some interesting roles usually divorced or single woman who are involved in some amway style business she is also regularly told to watch and observe but we seriously cant expect her to follow orders especially when she ends up saving the life of the main suspect a number of times basically it is was of those feel good action films where the quiet unassuming one ends up coming out good,comedy
since melissa mccarthy blew up in the mainstream eye in her dynamite supporting role in bridesmaids it feels like hollywood has been relentlessly forcing her in the front seat to no avail reuniting with paul feig they may have a subversive leading role thats right for her though im not necessarily inviting a new franchise with the dawn of a gritty and frankly better bond the genre is fresh for a kicking after not much action since austin powers unlike powers thrives when its not being an absurd spoof for example whenever theyre in the air and it gets ridiculous its best when its focused on mccarthys wit and vulnerability shining brightest in the former when she has opportunities to insult rose byrne while undercover it may be obvious in the way she fits firmly in the mold of an unlikely candidate for the role but it works but despite feigs talents in casting always a delight to see bobby cannavale he struggles most in action scenes with punches not landing in convincing ways and the camera planted where its difficult to locate the characters still a solid comedy for mccarthy which is nice to see if nothing too memorable610,comedy
ive become a fan of melissa mccarthy since i saw her first appearance on snl and then it was cemented with bridesmaids my affection for her work went over the top with a movie that most people hate that i absolutely loved the heat with the incredible chemistry between two great comedic actressesbullock and mccarthy so it was with great anticipation that i got to see this a bit disappointing really the movie was fairly stylish and overall fun especially jason statham as a hopelessly clueless wannabe bad ass but it seems a heavy notch or two below her other worklike any movie the plot is ridiculous a movie spoof will typically have a plot more ludicrous than what its trying to satirize so i dont hold that against this movie basically a timid woman with low self confidence mccarthy as agent susan cooper has been playing second fiddle to a handsome bondtype agent jude law as bradley fine and is suddenly thrust onto the main stage of dom when fine has apparently been killed and now a nuclear device is uncontained she has been holding back and playing it safe but will soon be forced to cut loose of course all is not what it seems on the surface the movie has strange shifts of tone from very sweet to wtf one such wtf moment was when the screen is suddenly filled by a mans erect penis the movie has swearing and one particularly disgusting scene of a mans throat dissolving as well as typical cartoonlike action movie violence but gotta say was not expecting that they didnt even show boobs in the whole movie but they show wang boobs and wang are not equivalent the comparable scene would be showing a spread quim which i dont really need to see either when im sitting down to watch whats supposed to be a comedy hopefully this doesnt become a trend there are already enough movies i cant take my nieces and nephews to i wouldnt even go with my nearly adult daughter even though shes more than seen them i would just feel awkward and so would she wrong contextthe action scenes are fairly typical some funny like the scene where agent cooper commandeers a scooter to chase the bad guys makes it a yard and falls promptly on its side dont know why but stuff like that worked good chemistry between mccarthy and statham who is hilarious and between mccarthy and rose bryne as rayna boyanov the daughter who inherits a criminal empire at times mccarthy is directly channeling her character in the heat in order to play a convincing bad ass so if you didnt like that side of her you probably wont like this although here it is an act while in the the heat it was the whole character of officer mullinsthe heat has a current rating of 57 while this one has 71 dont get that but i suppose this movie was better promoted with more stars on board or my tastes are outliers whatever its still worth watching just dont expect genius,comedy
i have to confess that before watching this movie i had never seen anything with melissa mccarthy before for that matter i knew little about this movie before watching it apart from the fact that it was a comedyso i didnt really have any expectations or prejudices when i sat down to watch i was kind of neutral maybe that explains why my feelings about the movie after watching it are kind of mixed first the good stuff there are some genuinely amusing or hilarious moment here and there and i thought melissa mccarthy was good in the lead role giving her character a lot of sympathy and spunk that made her extremely appealingnow the bad stuff the movie is stretched out way past the breaking point there is no way it had to be as long as it was a bigger problem however is the movies often raunchy tone dont get me wrong i watch r rated and unrated movies all the time and enjoy them but the raunchy tone in this movie is both relentless and out of place the movie should have stuck to complementing mccarthys basically sweet and likable characteri would normally in a situation like this recommend you wait until the movie was released on commercial television which would probably edit the running time down and rid itself of the raunchy stuff but i dont think this movie could be edited of all that raunch so i dont think i can recommend this movie however i will give melissa mccarthys next movie a chance though i will hope it finds an appropriate tone for whatever subject matter it deals with,comedy
the opening of this movie is just like spoofing a james bond music with the song and the graphics then we see jude law as bradley fine operating just like bond defeating crooks with his fighting skills and visual and vocal backup from headquartersback in headquarters is melissa mccarthy as susan cooper i first saw her 15 years earlier as sookie in gilmore girls and she has repeatedly shown what a fine actress she is given good material to work withthis movie has some good material but it also has some that stinks it is very uneven but mccarthy plays her role well she had been through agent training some 10 years earlier and relegated to the office since that time with his futuristic camera contact lens and his earpiece susan could see the agent and with her computer graphics even tell him when bad guys were around the corner sometimes even when to duck to miss a punchbut something bad happens as they are hunting rose byrne as notorious criminal rayna boyanov and there is a compact nuclear device at stake so susan is chosen to travel abroad  paris rome budapest  and keep an eye on the target under no circumstances was she to encounter the criminalno naturally that sets up a series of events that not only requires her to encounter rayna but eventually to pose as raynas bodyguard hired by her father right before he was killedthe best part of the movie is susan doing her secret agent thing fighting the bad guys fetching a gun and shooting because we would normally never expect that actress in that sort of role it is all a spoof and much of it works well mccarthy is great in the role my biggest gripe is that the writerdirector decided to use so much unnecessary foul language just for effect i suppose they think audiences would like this sort of movie without some characters using the fword several times each sentence it is just lazy writing the movie could have been so much better,comedy
melissa mccarthy known as one of the bridesmaids who stole every scene shes on in bridesmaids as a hilarious foulmouthed cop in the heat returns for another round of comedic turns in her latest movie teaming up with jason statham jude law and once again with rose byrne this summer flick shows her how much far she can go to be one of the most comic actorsactresses alivebegins as a spoof to the james bond movies where the cia is trying to find a nuclear bomb that is hidden by rayna boyanov who is trying to make a deal with de luca one of the most powerful man in the world as it turns out the mission wasnt quite as it should be until one of the deskanalyst is summoned to go on the fieldundercover movies has been done countless times but never been this much fun one of the reasons is that it packs many surprises as much as the jokes the casts are all around wonderful and of course all of this wouldnt work without mccarthys presence she threw everything on the table while the gags are a collection of hitandmiss it is the action that flips the table around paul feigs direction in here is very impeccable he gives the actors a room to crack up their inner funny self while other actioncomedies out there rely almost everything on slapstick except the jump street movie franchisethe only critical thing about this movie is the slow first act it feels a bit awkward because it wasnt really funny to watch but when the action starts it really lets loose filled with twist and turns and hell lotta funsee this movie in theaters and youll come out giddy and happy recommended,comedy
susan cooper melissa mccarthy is a deskside assistant that assists super cia operative bradley fine jude law from her computer monitor providing him with instant lifesaving updates yielding the full power of the united states military industrial complex at her fingertips she is able to pull off numerous surprises to keep her agent alive in the field however fines luck will eventually run out when he enters a home where the cias best technology is snarled and inoperative bradley fine is taken out of commission by raina boyanov rose byrne an aristocratic arms dealer with a flair for extravagance raina rambles off the names of the cias top agents and warns them to backoff the stakes are extremely high because the agency is trying to recover a mobile nuclear device before it is sold into the hands of a terrorist organization that plan to set if off in new york city this is when susan cooper will volunteer to become a field agent the cia director elaine crocker allison janney is reluctant but after viewing susans training videos from a decade before she decides to give the operation a green light however rick ford jason statham the unlikely comic relief is adamantly opposed to sending a woman into the field especially a desk jockey rick ford will continue throughout the film to essentially fill the role of a fool however surprising for this is wellknown action star the cia sends susan to her first assignment in paris where the plot quickly thickens and things do not unravel as planned it is not long before susan is posing as rainas personal body guard actually saving her life multiple times from various assassins while in rome the cia pairs susan with a reckless sleazy italian agent peter serafinowicz who continually attempts to steal a kiss but does not succeed while in rome the cia also sends nancy miranda hart another cia desk assistant into the field to assist susan while in a nightclub to prevent from having her cover blown susan asks nancy to create a diversion so susan can prevent a meeting between an unnamed female beauty nargis fakhri and raina nancys diversion consists of an altercation with the rapper 50 cent while he is performing on the stage meanwhile susan battles the assassin nargis fakhri in the kitchen with knives pans and persistence shortly after this we find ourselves in eastern europe where all the surviving characters and a few others appear for one final showdown susan will once again prove herself a superwith some amazing gymnastics reminiscent of kingsmen a recent film that lacks a womans perspective and went over the top with an eccentric plot the world is saved once again and rick ford jason statham does not know that he is only boating on a lake not the sea,comedy
this came out around the melissa mccarthy rage and it honestly looked terrible so i never had any interest in seeing it its not a great movie but it did surprise me the plot was decent enough with a couple plot twists but it was mainly about her free styling sometimes it was really funny and sometimes she just kept going too long which is basically what always happens with her i enjoyed the first half of the movie a lot but then she became more confident in the movie and thus her insults became more ridiculous i thought she was much more funny when she wasnt confident but either way it was a decent use of my time much better than i thought it would be,comedy
marks paul feig at his most talented and mccarthy as well mccarthy as always the result is funny and downright hilarious at times featuring a grade a cast with jude law jason statham rose byrne and of course melissa mccarthy is as entertaining as a summer action comedy can get mccarthy stars as cooper a cia agent that spends most of her time behind a computer being the strategic eyes and ears for cia field operative fine played by jude law when a set of tragic circumstances occur cooper is thrown into the field to apprehend a criminal mastermind who is in possession of a nuke as you can probably tell from the trailers shes wildly under qualified for the job what makes different from the heat and identity theft is that carries heart and merit that is purely thankful to paul feigs awesome script filled with satirical jabs at the government along with classic movie spoofs it makes for a really entertaining flick the comedic genius however does not come from the films lead it comes from a surprising sourcejason statham playing an exaggerated super agent who is more brawn than he is brain and doubts cooper the whole way statham is absolutely brilliant in this film he is on point in every scene and plays the role perfectly and has the physicality to make it work he can kick ass and still manage to make you crack up especially with an ending scene that is bound to have people rolling in the theater while i do think was mccarthys best performance since bridesmaids i still do take issue with the scenes of constant and vulgar strings of profanity the beginning of this film features our lead sweet and kind and very subtle in the way she delivered the comedythen by the middle of the film she is back to the mccarthy weve seen time and time again while it still does manage to make you crack up in the moment that is merely all it becomes none of those scenes resonated with laughter they were mere chuckles either way mccarthy is still amazing in this film even if some of it feels like a rehash of the same performance from the heat identity theft and bridesmaids the film as a whole is quite good but it starts to lose some steam around the 90 minute mark and starts to feel repetitive after awhile until the ending blasts out of nowhere and features a twist a shootout and a cameo from 50 cent after awhile it becomes pretty clear that there is a good fifteen minutes that could have been cut and trimmed but it still works overall is a funny violent action packed piece of entertainment that features melissa mccarthy at her best since bridesmaid and jason statham in one of his best performances ever,comedy
just as heat was both a good copbuddy movie and hilarious comedy feige also double dips this film as an adequate entertaining movie and a hilarity filled comedy feige has no problem making his characters seem mortal via termination  many spies good or bad meet their demise and a second pan of their body is not always obliged sometimes a character comes in that was introduced earlier is quickly killed off and the camera moves to the surviving folk to see what kind of reaction or what type of humor can be salvaged from the faux unfortunate situation the film style here is a genre all its own and it is refreshing to take in there were a couple of things that were not amazing in the film and feige was not going for plausability but the issue with the rodents and the agency seemed far fetched and unfunny as well as a couple of similar issues it was also nice when mccarthy was given free range to be raunchy and mean which she does not get until about a half hour in im not sure what these two have planned next but im sure it will slightly redefine the genre as well as fill it with rrated laughs,comedy
this is funny the language and situations are a bit raunchy its nothing terrible but as it says on the certificate violence sex references and strong language i think it says very strong language and that would be right theres no nudity or sex but there are humorous references to sexual situations susan cooper melissa mccarthy is a cia backroom girl who goes out in the field ably supported by bradley fine jude law rick ford jason statham and raina boyanov rose byrne as the villaintheres lot of fun with rick ford calling her incompetent naturally things start to go wrong the tale has a lot of natural twists and turns i enjoyed the fight scenes the best bit is the dialogue with the characters exchanging imaginative insults susan cooper gives as good as she gets there were real out loud laughs throughout the audience btw stay till after the credits theres an outtake worth seeing,comedy
anyone familiar with melissa mccarthy will by default be familiar with bridesmaids the film that made her famous for good reason too shes easily the best part of that movie so now that shes the new comedienne of today it was only a matter of time before she would capitalize on that success enter a film thats the next in a very long line of movie parodies thats occasionally funny but marred by its plotmccarthy plays susan cooper 007s assistant so to speak in cia headquarters she sits at her desk utilizing her intel to advise the agents out in the field needless to say shes terrific at her job of advising jude laweh agent bradley fine jude law but she feels her life lacks excitement conveniently directorwriter paul feig has just the thing in mind when an agents killed in the field she takes the job of getting close to the target and gathering information though she has zero experience her shall we say unnoticeable appearance makes her perfect to effortlessly into her surroundings agent rick ford jason statham finds the idea completely ridiculous because it is and resigns but has no intention of letting susan screw up the assignment and goes undercover to help out though as it turns out he is the one who could actually use helpyoull notice i said little to nothing about the baddies because that would require me to get into specifics regarding the plot its not that i care about spoilers its just that well who cares about plot in a movie parody theres bad guys conspiracies backstabbing money laundering you get the picture no ones seeing for its complex plot but for the jokes and the parodies directorwriter feig unfortunately spends an awful lot of time on said plot and all its intricacies entire scenes are spent explaining how all the baddies tie together the scheming etc hence the two hour runtime it breaks the momentum and the whole thing grinds to a halt whats worse is that in the end all this explaining doesnt build up to anything funny so youre left with that awkward feeling the films trying too hard to take itself seriously to render its central story plausible while it should be precisely the opposite a comedy especially a parody should always be in on the jokefortunately the comedy is pretty good if a bit pg13ish some of the jokes fall flat while others usually those involving mccarthy and statham are pretty funny speaking of statham i dont know if its a good career move to already be parodying himself as an action star but he does a splendid job his characters convinced of his skillfulness yet spends the entire film needing rescue hes always boasting about all the insane stunts hes pulled and terrible things hes experienced apparently his lover was tossed out of a plane and was then hit by another plane and at the end of the day hes still convinced he solved the case pretty much singlehandedly good stuffin the end is pretty standard comedy fair it doesnt reinvent the wheel nor are its parodies of the genre really original but it does enough things right to warrant a recommendation as modern comedies go theres way worse things to watch than mccarthy and statham arguing,comedy
this is not a movie i particularly wanted to see im not a melissa mccarthy fan at all however it was the next movie playing so i took the plungei didnt hate it but i didnt enjoy it that much either i really just didnt appreciate the humour of a fat wisecracking american woman playing a james bond of course she turns out to be clever and not inept at alli thought it was on the lame side it lacked wit and intelligence i barely laughed at all and i dont really understand those who said they laughed throughout the movie i suppose you have to buy into melissa mccarthys schtick to enjoy this and i just dont its not a total bomb but i wouldnt recommend it either her brand of humour is just not my thing,comedy
i sort of had mediocre expectations going into this because that is usually the case with a melissa mccarthy film not that i dislike her at all shes very good at what she does but shes a one trick pony hey look im fat laugh at me look at me run look at me be a big dirty offensive loud mouthagain and again and again now i can say that all day long but her movies have always been very amusing somehow the heat which was most like this as an action comedy was phenomenal it was hilarious and fun and full of action is an attempt at spoofing the james bond genre something weve already had done this year to near perfection kingsman and the biggest problem with is that it tries soooo hard honestly there are scenes that will make you feel like youre watching a kid trying his best to make a funny joke you just want to go oh sweetheart thats so cutenot funny but you tried some of the humour feels very forced and obvious the characters are not exactly thrilling and overall its an average movie that is what youd expect stillall the bad mouthing being said it was entertaining a couple of chuckles and actually has a few decent scenes of action that are generally ruined by a bad jokemelissa mccarthy is the same gal she always is at first it seems like this particular character has a softer side but her personality changes when she is undercover into that brash loud mouth character she does so well you either enjoy her or you dont and for the most part i do she does manage to really play a good down to earth person in ridiculous circumstances the supporting cast are all decent in their various roles and serve single purposes and to support mccarthy who is the money maker if you watch the trailers youll think this is a buddyspoof starring mccarthy and jason statham the truth of the matter is that statham is a third string character at best he has some good moments as they repeatedly spoof his actionmartial arts persona but he sporadically shows up and is anything but her partner rose byrne might be the highlight of the film as the insatiably stuck up villainess rayna her and mccarthy have good chemistry and her ridiculously cookiecutter character works for her and is mostly fun miranda hart is sort of fun as mccarthys good friend and sortofwouldbe partner in the field shes awkward and geeky and is likable in her role jude law is decent as the suave superbradley fine he gets some good character developments and some inadvertently funny momentspaul feig has firmly placed himself into comedy elite now i certainly dont always agree with it i still think bridesmaids is one of the most overrated raunch coms of the last decade but you cant deny his box office prowess he writes and directs and i think he is surrounded by comedians that hes comfortable with mccarthy in this case and he knows exactly what her audiences want to see so he gives them that his comedies dont try too hard to not be anything but just silly gross out comedy and it works for him in my books he hit a homerun with the heat which was the perfect blend of action comedy characters and raunch and i am convinced he will destroy ghostbusters but we will wait and see is an average comedy that you can find some entertainment value in but is definitely not in the tops of any of the main players repertoire its just fun 710,comedy
the best thus far of those flicks that have tried to spoof the james bond franchise done with great respect except for the nonstop profanity and occasional gross sexual humor  but after all its an adult comedy from the opening sequence theme song and credits the homage to bond is upfront and topnotch melissa mccarthy plans a deskbound cia agent assigned to monitor agents on assignment in the field in this case the agent played by jude law when he is taken out of action the agency has to assume the ids of several agents have been compromised and only someone unknown to the enemy can be sent into the field to pick up the case the whereabouts of a suitcase nuke mccarthy talks the director allison janney into assigning her to the job which sets the stage for the misadventures mccarthy is so superb at carrying out along the way we encounter the occasional bond plot devices like mccarthy being briefed on how to work all her special gadgets except the lipstick blowtorch michael mcdonald is nifty as the counterpart to q in the bond flicks one of mccarthys fellow agents is deadset against her going into the field and walks out on his job played by jason statham mccarthy now has the added task of trying to determine if hes going rogue with his own plan to track down the suitcase nuke statham plays his usual toughguy martialarts action character multiplied tenfold in terms of intensity and the results are hilarious rose byrne plays the glamorous archenemy at the center of the plot to deal the suitcase nuke and detonate it in the heart of nyc and her faceoffs with mccarthy are a perfect match even the closing credits are a good laugh and stick around for an outtake with stathan at the very end the only way to improve this flick would have been to have former bond and secretagent actors do short cameos like daniel craig sitting at the blackjack table in the casino pierce brosnan and timothy dalton bump into each other walking down the hallway at the agency or barbara feldon as some sort of administrator at the agency maybe in the sequel of which there has to be at least one because this trip ended way too soon,comedy
follows the story of susan cooper a unassuming deskbound cia analyst and the unsung hero behind the agencys most dangerous missions but when her partner falls off the grid and another top agent is compromised she volunteers to go deep undercover to infiltrate the world of a deadly arms dealer and prevent a global crisis paul you have done it once more you have managed to keep me amused the entire time with all sorts of hilarity put to the screen with such a amusing film like this one it brought a lot of pleasant humor than i thought it would the jokes struck one after another which actually functioned most of the time and what i am very pleased about melissa mccarthy did bring most of her same antics which was proper for the film because at times i thought she was pretty settled and brought her a game and didnt try too hard with her role one of the most significant parts about this film would to be jason statham bringing his comedic side to the screen was such a major triumph he was such a riot he made me laugh in each scene he was in and really was the highlight for me in this my only defects i have with the film is the use of clichs and the foreseeable plot it really was nothing new to me because ive seen it all before in many other films it wasnt hard to really see what was approaching next many of you out there may not enjoy this because of maybe your annoyance with mccarthy yeah she can bring some dull moments but overall she can bring some quality humor that can mostly hit some attributes that really surprised me was the action it was actually pretty satisfying to bring to a comedy i got a real kick out of it because its probably the best i have seen in a comedy in the end was a overall zinger with the nonstop laughs and charming supporting cast including jude law  rose byrne feig really put a sharp turn into this comedy and brought up more quickwitted styles we didnt think he had before but is one charismatic ride you could ever have with such a abnormal secret agent like mccarthy and still manage to stick with throughout,comedy
i for one didnt want to knock it for the movies it borrows from but as 1 reader saidits a kingsman wanna be may come across as a kingsman the secret service reminiscence it teems with brutal action and bloody stunt demonstrations but presents an even more nearfatal doses of comedy that would surely send you to the edge of your seat while laughing your ass off melissa mccarthy proves to be the strongest asset of this movie coming out as fully capable of carrying out the demands of her role her transition from a timid analyst to an aggressive and cunning secret agent is fast and seamless but once shes on duty she becomes something impeccably ready for deadly action however it wouldnt feel right to dismiss the efforts of her equally capable costars jason statham he just exudes charm and class i would recommend,comedy
so this movie is sort of a spoof for movies and for the most part i had fun watching this flick now when it comes to the plot its nothing special but its the direction they decided to go with it that added to its entertainment value i first decided to pass on this movie since the trailer wasnt all that appealing to me and i thought it was going to be another lame comedy until my friends started to talk about how humorous and fun it was so i decided to check it out now this isnt one of the best comedy i seen but it was still a bloody good time and wasnt cheesy like i thought it would be i dont want to come off mean nor is that my intention but the title of this movie should have been its funny because she is fat because this movie revolves most of its joke on how fat the protagonist is the constant poke at the protagonist because of her appearance and the circumstances she gets into because of her weight got a bit old for me i mean if she was a skinny chick going on this mission the movie wouldnt have any comedy value still for few parts i did find it humorous i wasnt necessarily laughing through this movie but i did find it a entertaining flick with few entertaining bantering between characters the casts really made this movie work melissa mccarthy is again doing what she does in most of her movies but then again most comedians play the same or similar character with different names over and over again however she worked well in this flick i guess the director really knows how to utilize her jude law is once again playing the sleazy guy and jason statham plays this badass who does constant monologues about how badass he is his character isnt that bright but is likable and slightly annoying at the same time overall this is a fun comedy that is actually worth seeing at the theater once7310,comedy
okay what this is is funny i loved 90 of the movie really there is a lot here to like yes it is silly and crazy but that is what makes it funnyso why only 7 stars one fight is boring because apparently getting clocked with a frying pan or stabbed with a knife or tossed into shelves are apparently not even remotely damaging or disorienting moves that will break a nose if not an entire face in reality a shaken off with barely a grunt props for some clever prop usage thoughanother fight is very well done but we could have skipped the projectile vomiting onto the newly deceased i will admit that that vomiting is a likely possibility for someone not used to fighting and killing but it was too gross to be funnylanguage was way beyond what needed to be used this is my biggest peeve i really dont get why this had to be laced with so much profanity there is difference between an upset agent in a profanity tirade and then women using it a bonding clearly there were talented writers involved so why did the script dissolve to such drivel really did we have to include dick pictures i found that offensiveagain theses are why i took off stars i think most of this movie was clever and funny and woman centric which is cool it just had some problems with a few points,comedy
the movie was not bat tell the picture of dick in the phone sceneidont like when comedy movie use naked scene as fun element,comedy
i was shocked that i liked this ive never liked melissa mccarthy and id said multiple times you couldnt pay me to watch that the comedy wasnt always consistent but i was dying laughing at a bunch of stuff multiple hilarious characters and completely unexpected jokesit also had some horrible characters cia boss and some of the jokes fell flat some of the story was expected altho a lot wasnt and i was a little confused if it was trying to be realistic or just stupidfunny at times regardless i was very entertained by the comedy and some surprisingly good action it was a very well made movie with the way it was executed production value music etcthe second time i watched this i saw the extended version which is 11 minutes longer it seemed to drag and there were some really unfunny parts that im guessing were the extended scenes i wanted to drop it to a 30 but i left it at 35 2 viewings,comedy
first of all when people watch the movie and leave nasty degrading reviews only means its personal its amazing how angry people leaving reviews here are i kinda feel sorry fir them because r i see their blood pressure risinghaving said that i gave 7 to this movie because melissas mouth i hope she can just fix that one thing because she takes it to all her movies and make her seem like she needs to be vulgar to survive i just wish she can tone it down a bitokay the story was not believable when the movie started bradley fine was good he killed all bad guys swiftly but towards the end he couldnt but watched as susan unleashed her superskills i feel it was gonna be better if they fought alongside each otherit was also not believable that rayna fell so quickly for bradley fine that she trusted him in 2 minutes to include him in her nuke deal you must remember that in the private jet rayna told susan that she does not trust any body soooo yeawhen raynas drink was spiked susan only said to her that someone put a roofie in her drink but rayna responded by saying that could you point the man outi also think that a scene where rayna and bradley were kissing when susan said shes a loud kisser she shouldve continued by saying that she sounds like an old toothless woman sucking the jelly out of a doughnut and not she looks if you catch my drift but as i always say i blame the whole behind the scenes crew the acting was great i was mostly impressed by jason i did not picture him in comedy at all but he nailed it he musnt do it often because being serious works a great deal for him it was nice to see him laid back and laughing the rock however just blends in everythingtheres another one thing i dont like about melissas movies i realized this on heat where most men hits on her a lot that should also be toned down it puts a negative spin on her roles its unnecessary attentionis a nice movie so thumbs up for me,comedy
mediocre action comedy its not crap but from such names i expected a lot more610,comedy
may contain spoilers the cast was pretty good but the script subpar when i got the dvd and watched it a few times along with some of the outtakes i realized the main problem with a fairly decent film was the doggone editing they left out some really funny lines that would have made the actual film much better the back and forth of some really lame conversation that was supposed to be over the top was too over the top to be enjoyed by me again the editing of how long the camera lingered on things for the full comedy impact was not done well it flashed around on things and made changes from one day to another so quickly without context sometimes it was disturbing cute in parts but basically kind of disappointing i used to be a huge mccarthy fan but not so much anymore her characters are getting too gross for my liking,comedy
based upon the success of the heat a film role was written for melissa mccarthy i think everyone knows the plot where a desk jockey agent goes into the field with expected results jason statham while having a minor role provided laughs with his serious description of impossible anticsmany scenes were film spoofs the film teetered on cheese not knowing whether it should venture there or not the main problem i had with this film is that i kept mentally comparing it to the heat and frankly the heat was funnier the film is worth seeing but there is nothing spectacular about the cinematography that demands it be seen on the large sceneguide excessive fbombs no sex brief male nudity,comedy
so here we have another very unfunny comedy film why is it people think swearing out of context is funny swearing can be much more comedic when handled as part of a witty dialogue then of course there are the standard poo jokes the even more used machismo parodies based on the overutilised underdog that learns to bite back and roar like a lion storyline with a twist thats so obvious its actually not a twist this is just a mashup of the usual elements however writer and director paul feig does give us something new with them he actually makes them boring throughout the entire film there were three places that made me smile and only one that made me laugh and that was towards the end  a long time to waitthough i will say this for feig he really can direct a film the only thing which keeps this movie interesting is the direction there are quite a few decent camera shots and angles well lighted and composed hes also pretty good at action the fight scenes are spot on and the chase sequences are excitingly filmed if it werent for this and the cast the film would be a real dudas for the acting this was below par for most of the cast and it was the lead role of susan cooper mccarthy which spoils the film instead of strengthening it this is mainly because mccarthy plays mccarthy most of the characters shes played to date can be easily interchanged between their films as there are very few differences it would be nice to see her stretch her acting wings in her next role maybe if she actually had a good script and an original character to work withi watched this for miranda i wondered how good she would be in a movie she wasnt too bad it was her scene that made me laugh but there wasnt much to stretch her skills here and for jason statham as ive been a fan since i saw him in the one he has grown as an actor throughout his career though this feels like a few steps backwardsif youre a mccarthy fan you should like this though itll feel all too familiar at times as for everybody else its an okay way to waste some time if youve got nothing better to do,comedy
ok i have no idea but the version i saw had no nudity just saw it have no clue why they thought it was worth putting in without bits of that camera scene its much better that just makes it seem like adam sandler was directing for 30 seconds,comedy
a desk bound cia agent gets her chance to work in the field with outlandish consequencesin this comedy melissa mccarthy plays susan cooper the cia analyst turned field agent with ease and holds the film up effortlessly jason statham steals the show as a super hard parodying his teflon action persona with some great lines his comedy timing is impeccable jude law sends himself up wonderfully in a bondlike role rose byrnes steely raina is a hoot the supporting cast are equally as fun including homeland and vs morena baccarin uks miranda hart as nancy peter serafinowicz and even a slightly forced cameo by 50 cent as himself notable are allison janney as elaine crocker cia head and beauty nargis fakhridirector writer paul feig offers some competent action set setups notably a kitchen fight and the garage showdown the script is punchy the language is colourfully foul throughout although many of the jokes are crude they mostly hit the mark even the uncomfortable ones with some laughout loud moments  great globetrotting fun feigs while not as sharply put together or executed as the comparable kingsmen its almost as unpredictable thanks to some twists and turns with helicopters car chases and gadgets its a basic blast from start to finish thanks to mccarthys likability and the strong supporting cast,comedy

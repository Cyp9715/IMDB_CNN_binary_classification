this movie is simply funny it aims to make you laugh and no more anyone who dissect the plot and put the acting and screenplay of this film under a microscope is missing the entire point of this moviethis is a comedy not a documentary or an historical saga this is plane humor dumb with a bit of a slapstick taste the entire situation is fictional of course and thats what so funny about it ive read some comment about this movie here and the people who wrote these comment are way off talking like those bigshot movie critics this is a fun movie to watch with a stupid yet hilarious story simple comedy and a lot of what some people call toilet humor which is always funny  its nothing more than pure entertainment and it leaves you with a smile on your face which is never a bad thing right ive seen this movie 5 times and i still laugh my heart out d,comedy
after an unsuccessful mission fbi agents kevin copeland shawn wayans and marcus copeland marlon wayans fall in disgrace in the agency they decide to swap their bad position with his superior section chief elliott gordon frankie faison working undercover in an abduction case disguised in the two spoiled daughters of a tycoon brittany and tiffany wilson getting in hilarious situationsi like the silly and funny movies that keenen ivory wayans directs his formula mixing gross low level and racist jokes are hilarious and highly recommended for days when you are down and trouble my soccer time lost the game in the afternoon and i was very upset while watching i laughed a lot and i really liked this comedy which will never be nominated to an oscar or to cannes but it is delightful to shutdown the brain and feel amusement and joy with this type of silliness to improve the humor my vote is seventitle brazil as branquelas ,comedy
okay i was dragged kicking and screaming to this movie i made my friends pay for my ticket in protest when the majority voted to see this and i was stranded at the movie theater without my car when i first heard of it i thought the premise was absurd the makeup laughable and the jokes seemed racist i was right about the first two things yes you are not fooled for one minute that marlon and shawn are actually either of the 2 pampered princesses they impersonate yes you cant imagine anyone else being fooled either but for one moment just suspend your disbelief and take this movie for what it is a comedy a gutbusting rolling on the floor laughing and quotable oneliners kind of comedy this was the funniest movie i have seen in a long time this movie makes fun of everyone black rich poor dorks cool people no one is safe and the brother who falls for marlon in disguise had me peeing in my pants and theres even bit of commentary about social and racial stereotypes all in all an enjoyable experience,comedy
i have seen the unrated version on dvd together with my familyi was very much suspicious about this movie from the moment when i saw the dvd cover and really wanted to push stop button after the first 5 minutes of the film especially after seeing absolutely silly makeup  lucky for me others wanted to continue watching what followed was 1 12 hours of great comedy some scenes are so hilarious that even after seeing them many times i still laugh again when seeing themin some way this movie is identical to soul plane by being an underdog which is blamed to be racist and full with low level jokes perhaps it is but i still find it very funny1010 partly because of the imho unjustified low total rating this movie has,comedy
so i am not a fan of homeboy movies but every time i see this movie come on i have to watch it i laugh myself silly every time i cannot help it but the wayans brothers totally kill it with this one it is so not about a plausible plot but about being extremely entertaining with a great cast of characters i definitely do not watch movies for hidden meanings a significant message or the artistry i watch movies purely for entertainment and enjoyment and this one definitely fits the billfor those critics who just want a meaningful just pass for those of you wanting pure laughs and entertainment watch it but why listen to me make up your own mind,comedy
after seeing the wayans brothers in scary movie 1 and scary movie 2 i had high expectations on this film not because they are comic geniuses or anything but because they are one of the few toilet humor actors i can tolerate and even find quite humorous under the right conditions pulled out all the stops and remains one of my favorite movies to watch till this daythere was just so much hilarious material that was quite different from some of the other comedies i had recently seen yes the main plot is really unbelievable but it pays off all the cast knew what kind of film they were working with and slap it up whenever they can one of my favorite scenes is in the dressing room and another is at a restaurant i will leave it at that for those who have not seen it this film left me smiling long after it was over because it started off strong and carried out the whole way through thats all it really needed to do i must say that there was nothing wrong with this film at all and that it was totally funny it was kind of obvious how when the brothers in the film dressed up to be the sisters they looked nothing like them but i still thought it was a great underrated comedy,comedy
is the funnest film i have watched in years am i the only one who thought the made up black dudes looked better than the real as for all the comments about the film being racist cant anybody watch a film any more as a film  as a comedy film and not as a statement of america right now remember its a comedy you laugh at funny things on film you dont watch a comedy film to write a check list of every thing not politically correct about the movie its a movie to be enjoyed by the masses not by the political correctness police get a life people i watch a film to enjoy that film i watch the terminator and i dont think while im watching it mmmm arnie cant act he shouldnt be in this film lets have dustin hoffman play the terminator he can act cause that would be and is stupid watch a film to enjoy thats what they are for,comedy
this comedy is magnificent and is entertaining and hilarious all the way through one of the best things about the film is that they didnt use the same jokes that every other comedy movie based on someone dressing up as someone else and pretending to be them also the work that went into making shawn and marlon wayans look so convincing as must have been massive because they looked brilliant frankie faison was alright playing the chief and delivered a few clever scenes terry crews was excellent as latrell spencer and was a good touch to the movie of course the stand outs were the wayan brothers which any one could tell even just from the trailer of the movie this performance almost stood up to their roles in scary movie 1 and 2 which is really really saying something lets hope they keep writing movies with keenan ivory wayans who deserves as much credit if not more for the writing and starring in them as well because god knows they can act and act brilliantly great movie the toilet humor was well done too,comedy
americans are some of the most uptight folks on the planet to the folks who think this movie is anything but funny well you are hopelesspc in your case means pitifully cramped humor like beauty is unique to each person but the wayans seem to be able to dish out equal portions of playful jabs and tongueincheek which appeals to mea look at the hilton sisters and their lifestyle gives more than enough fodder to make something really funny and it is in this movieif you want intellectualism go elsewhere this is just smartly funny,comedy
this film had me laughing from the preview to the credits it is a prefect movie to watch when you just broke up with your boyfriendgirlfriend and lost your dog you will be smiling in no time the plot is totally unrealistic but that just adds to the funny of the film anyone who says this movie was not funny must have no sense of humor at all because everything out this movie was funny i thought my stomach was about to explode i was laughing the fact that they looked nothing like the actual girls makes it even more hilarious actually when i seen this movie my grandfather had just died and i couldnt help but laugh when i saw this film funny i cant find any other way to describe it good job wayans,comedy
this is one of my favorite comedies its an excellent movie i even saw it twice and i laughed a lot i totally understand why many love this movie but some really think its a crap if you want to see a serious comedy you wont like this one because its very absurd i mean how can two black guys transform into two and nobody sees the difference the plot is very unreal something you wont see in the real life but if you pass over this things youll see one of the best comedies the acting is great the plot is very entertaining so i recommend this movie to everyone who wants to laugh a lot and enjoy a great comedy,comedy
this is just plain fun and will have you laugh until your insides hurt marlon and shawn wayans go undercover by using disguises in order to infiltrate the rich and uncover something biggeronly their seniors have no idea whats happeningthis film is hilarious from start to finish the laughs just keep coming you wont be able to stop for a minute to catch your breath terry crew is perfect for his role his lines are funny and his physique is amazing while the other characters are just as good far too many to name it does have an element of bad boys but it workssome critics label this movie as stupid i think its a film were you can just sit back and laugh out loud it isnt the greatest plot but thats not what this aims to doits not an oscar nomination its purpose is to make the audience laugh and enjoy themselves and thats what it does with perfect precision,comedy
i would have never seen this movie if it wasnt for younger siblings its the kind of movie you dont think you will ever see and i saw it and i laughed again and againi didnt find it racist because i found the comedy mostly geared toward differences between men and women and the most hilarious aspects of the film come from the wayans brothers dressing up as the girls and the tribulations they havepersonally i can understand how anyone over the age of twenty might not find it as funny its a comedy mostly geared toward younger people in the way of night at the roxbury or even clueless my advice would be to see it but dont expect too muchmaybe youll like it,comedy
this is absolutely hands down the worst movie i have seen in years i was looking for an easy watch but jesus i was handed this movie after a long days work and was disgusted just reading the title i was informed that it was actually hilarious so turned my brain off for a couple of hours of bubble gum comedy now i understand some people take a while to twig on to a joke but why the incessant pauses after a really small and lame joke most of the so called punch lines were strained to say the least with nothing other than toilet humor and bad taste behind them sure you may want to giggle but then move on the makeup and jokes were so bad the script was written for 12 year olds and the stereo types were actually too muchlike too stereotypical and i didnt think that could be doneutter trash,comedy
from the previews and my own idea of what the movie might be like i was very hesitant to spend the time to even give this one a chance that is at least a critical part of this movie you must at least give it a chance if you arent willing to take a leap then i doubt you will get much out of itand even then it wont be a huge amount quickly from the outlandish premise the characteristic differences of a rich woman and black man are laid out heavily this will form the foundation one might think obviously of the movie most of the movie for me was watched through a wince of pain as a train wreck unfolded before my eyes although that is simply part of the fun and entertainment here you know it is ridiculous and thoughts of wow how much worse could it be seep in and you begin to enjoy it if you are looking for shallow comedy yes you have found itand there is nothing wrong with thati found the man playing latrell to be a solid inspiration of humor he put what may be the best performance into this movie and even saying that now surprises me he was hilarious the wayans brothers do as well as anyone could hope to in their role playing to the ridiculous situation wellanother movie in a trend of superfluous comedy has its place here and is worth seeing after all what price can you put on a laugh even if its only one,comedy
let me just sum up the plot so you can see for yourself why this movie sucks basically two black fbi agents pose as rich girls in order to foil a dastardly kidnapping plot and thats it that supports one hundred minutes of the wayans brothers and their socalled humor how did this get made what were they thinking ive never been a big wayans brothers fan little man remember thatand they strike out big time here the cast which contains some very funny and gifted actors are given nothing to do and a script that doesnt make any sense in fact the movie actually gets worse and worse with each excruciating minutelet me just recap two black guys pose as girls for an undercover assignment sound funny it isnt,comedy
someone really needs to sit down with the wayans explain how terrible their work is maybe bring some clips of it to help illustrate that point seriously are they simply surrounded by a mix of yesmen and people too worried theyll be accused of prejudice against africanamericans keenen ivory stop directing please youre not very good at itunless im gonna git you sucka is the exception to the rule i sincerely doubt that little man is and those are the only two ive yet to watch shawn and waylon just plain stop damon what the heck happened to the show you had titled after yourself man that had hilarious moments and all of you do not write again if the gag isnt doesnt make us laugh the first time why would it help to repeat it that happens several times in this the material consists mainly of offensive stereotypes and making fun the hilton sistersand types like them and fashion and such and anyone whod enjoy this flick are already making those jokes so why bother frankly nobody their behavior is plenty enough nobody has to make an effort to mock them everybody here is a soulless caricature the misunderstandings and their solutions all seem like they were rejected from lousy sitcoms part of the problem is while the makeup is welldone the audience are not fooled and that makes it tough to accept that everyone in the movie is if you want to laugh at men in drag for an entire motion picture go for some like it hot or at least mrs doubtfire this merely tries to gross us out and hopes well confuse that for humor the dvd has three featurettes there is strong language and pretty explicit sexual stuff at least there is eye candy i recommend this solely to fans of the brothers 110,comedy
i just had to write a few lines here to express my concern over how this movie can be rated 5 out of 10 on imdb i can watch a bad movie and laugh out loud over how bad it is and afterwards still feel that it was worth watching ghost anyone this movie is worth a negative score if it was possible its pure crap in its purest formit is of course my personal opinion but if you think you can get anything out of this movie you are wrong its not a feelgood movie or anything its just plain uglybring back some quality comedies please,comedy
well i thought this movie was pretty terrible  literally as in pretty funny but terrible plot as for the racist label i dont think it can be taken seriously the film was a compendium of stereotypes from beginning to end the slapstick bling laden rap happy likable but incompetent black duo as improbable fbi agents the stern but ultimately soft hearted black police chief how many of these have we seen over the years the buff mandingo with the appetite for meat the rich shopping crazy catty heiresses etc etc well it was funny in its circumstances although when flatulence is used to this extent it means the director was seriously running out of ideas believable no way the two agents were as credible as as john kerry would be as jlo dont waste your time  save it for tv in a couple of years time i vote 4,comedy
sporting two of the worst makeup jobs in motion picture history shawn and marlon wayans play incompetent undercover fbi agents who dress up as a couple of blond bimbo socialites to nab a kidnapper borrowing virtually all of its plot points  and none of its style  from that genderbending template some like it hot hits a new low in cross dressing comedies not only are the makeup jobs repulsive and thoroughly unconvincing but the humor rarely rises above the waistline about half the jokes center around flatulence and the other half around bodily functions in general unlike most actors stuck in a turkey of this caliber the wayans have no one to blame but themselves and their older and presumably more experienced brother keenan ivory who directed the film and cowrote the screenplay with themthis is about as completely unfunny as any comedy could ever hope to be but what i really want to know is how a movie that uses transvestism as its theme can still manage to trash gays every chance it gets,comedy
i havent seen such a bad movie for really long time im really surprised to see it score 38 currently because if there was any negative scale on imdb then it should definitly get 10 and be nominated for lamest movie ever made title what a pos stay away from it if you have at least one working brain cell left i cant believe anyone could write such lame lines and whats worse  that actor with such great potential like marlon wayans  tyrone from requiem for a dream the black dude from scary movie agreed to play in itkeenan ivory wayans should stick to acting because thats where he excels it takes sharp mind to write a screenplay for a comedy and as easy as it may seem  it is actually much more difficult to write any average comedy than to write any best in da hood gangsta flick110,comedy
i didnt like any of the wayans movies the scary movie franchise being the worst but comes as quite a nice surprise its actually quite funny and has some laughoutloud moments keenan ivory wayans finally offers a film thats actually funny without heading too much towards the direction of horrendous stupidity shawn wayans and marlon wayans are supported by a competent cast that includes lochlyn munro jaime king john heard anne dudek busy philipps and frankie faison i find marlon wayans unbearably annoying in his other films but here he is quite likable and his character is more mature than the crap he played in other films shawn wayans did show signs of a good actor in requiem for a dream and here he does a decent job both actors are excellent as the however isnt without its share of flaws the opening sequence makes you want to walk away from the movie some of the comedy just falls flat and some of the toiler humour is overdone yet in spite of that the movie works as a brilliant comedy i love the scenes where marlons character returns home after partying and he dozes off while his wife is whining latrells lust for brittany brittany and tiffany wanting to listen to hiphop in the car but their friends prefer something else there are quite a few such moments that got me laughing out loud,comedy
i am astounded that anybody would say that this is a great movie i understand that this is a comedy but the whole plot is unbelievable the two men dont look like women or the people they are posing as it is unrealistic to think that these girls friends wouldnt notice that the friends they see every day have grown a foot and a half and have mens bodies all of the jokes in this movie are lame the only thing that made me laugh was the big black guy singing in the car and that certainly is not enough to make this movie watchable the people responsible for bringing this piece of crap to the theatres should be ashamed of themselves i would not recommend this movie to anybody,comedy
after watching this movie again i found more humor in it but it was still lacking i dont think i would actually recommend this movie to anyone unless they really wanted to watch a scary movie some parts of this movie are very creepy the faces are very awkward throughout the movie there is a part where the heiresses walk into the pool party and the politician and his wife turns around that lady has to be the single creepiest thing i have ever seen in a filmthe plot was very poor but the general feel of the film was cheap the humor just barely makes up for the poor acting from the wayans brothers this is a c class movie i would only watch this if you rent it for 099,comedy
this is a terrible poorly acted contrived instantcoffee like shallow dimwitted dull onedimensional piece of summer fluff  but strangely if you check your iq in at the door and think about all the terrible things happening in the world really think hard about them two normally unfunny and 2ndrate actors dressing up like chics can be sort of funny at times   the handful of silly though occasionally funny scenes in this movie employ the lowest common denominator type of humor popular in schools across the land including the beloved and timelessfarting  scenes progress from one to the next in paint by numbers version of comic movie making with the expected and mostly tired racial stereotypes tapped  the film isnt racist but of course thered be no way a film with two guys dressing up as black girls acting say ghetto would ever fly  a double standard  yes but its been open season on uptight honkey culture since men cant jump and sometimes deservedly so  however most chics would never identify or be accepted by the upper class elite portrayed in the film whether theyre from the east hamptons or anywhere else so chics also aims it comic sights on the much more acceptable and welcomed sendup of the rich albeit rich people   some of the funnier moments include the big football player black who falls for one of the chics thinking shes that rare combination of girl with a black girl booty  those scenes were among the few that really had some potential to generate some serious laughs but apart from a one or two the opportunity was mostly missed  the end of the film is even more canned than the rest and pretty much unravels whatever potential it had built up in earlier to reveal its expected slim core  the film is one dimensional comedy built on one joke disguise black guys as girls uses well played out racial stereotypes and familiar jabs at the rich  however farting is timeless,comedy
i gotta say this movie for me is a classic even though it came out in 2004 i think it is a classic the thing that in my opinion is even more funny than the witty lines is the facial expressions of the characters they are hysterical trust me they are hilarious the only reason that i didnt give it a ten is because of the acting from two supporting actors i think you would be able to determine them yourself overall an awesome movie a movie you can watch over and over again i have and i know that you will want to too dont think about it just do it you will not regret it,comedy
is a funny but crude comedy and goes over the top a lot shawn and marlon wayans play fbi agents assigned to investigate the kidnapping of rich debutantes in the hamptons in order to fit into this foreign territory they go undercover as young coeds getting involved with a group of high society debutantes that may be able to help them solve the crimes the premise has to be one of the dumbest ideas ever but the movie doesnt take itself seriously and you can just sit back and enjoy first problem is that after the transformation they look nothing like the wilson sisters but we have to accept that they do since everyone else does there are some really funny moments in the film but also just as many groans from the audience of course not all of it is funny some is way to racist to be funny and some is toilet humor which is the worst attempt at trying to get laughs the cast is familiar with comedy and the leads shawn wayans and marlon wayans do their best and they are funny most of the time marlon wayans is also the worst actor in the movie especially during the serious scenes jessica calffiel is hilarious as tori and i hope she finds work in hollywood since shes really talented and pretty the rest of the cast is mostly unknowns and may spark a laugh here or there but they arent worth mentioning keenen ivory wayans wrote and directed however scary movie 1 and 2 are a lot better a lot of people complain that this movie is too racist but you shouldnt take everything serious especially a dumb comedy rating 610 funny movie yet it goes overboard with its 110 running time this film is worth watching if you liked scary movie and other films of that caliber,comedy
i know im late to the party for this one but all i can say is that this is the worst thing ever made this movie is so bad it made me physically ill the master copy should be destroyed and all the actors sent to a secluded island hands down this is the worst movie ever made troll 2 is awful but its so bad that its fun is so bad that anyone who watches it instantly loses 20 iq points i wanted to die after seeing this long story short this movie is awful apparently reviews have to be 10 lines long so here we go its not funny the disguises the wayans brothers wear are horrifying they not only do not look like people they dont even look human,comedy
its just so difficult to wrap your head around how gutwrenchingly atrocious this thing is imagine being trapped in your worst nightmare for almost two hours and you have some vague idea of what its like to sit through this pile of trashits just so inept and meaningless when a film cant justify its own existence then youre better of just burning the negative and pretending it never happened it doesnt generate a single laugh except out of sheer embarrassment for the actors and theres zero social commentary because every character is such a poorly written clich that you cant get past how overthetop they areno one seems to be enjoying what theyre doing the editing is atrocious all attempts at humor rely solely on the lowest possible juvenile sensibilities and the plot conceit is so entirely implausible that this film just defines bomb really its that bad i was forced to watch this for a girl of course and still cant believe my eyes i really want to vomitanyone who claims to like it or find this a guilty pleasure should crawl out of the wall they live in and see at least one more movie if you think this is tolerable then pretty much any other film ever made no matter what it is will seem like a magical masterpiece sent straight from heaven,comedy
stupid racist crapi dont suspect that a movie making whites into blacks and making fun of them would go over very well but this is apparently different in some way as whites are the butt of the rather unfunny joke lump this piece of crap in with soul plane what about the makeup effects did anyone in the universe think that those two racist idiots looked even slightly like real humans rather than poorly madeup mannequins why oh why did the studio give this movie the go ahead i can promise you that no studio would allow a filmmaker and a cast to do the exact opposite of this movie yet it is obviously okay for them to put out this blatantly racist piece of tripe,comedy
seriously  was that supposed to be funny  i was almost crying they disgraced the whole comedy film historyif you havent seen it  donti you have seen it  im sorry  i know it was painful just try to forget what you sawthe acting  awful  directing  awful  make ups and stuff  awful i dont even know why it got 46 ranking and its been all written and directed by those wayans guys i didnt know a family could be this awful   this film dried my sense of humour i cant laugh at anything anymore  just avoid it ,comedy
in short all the characters are overdone caricatures the storyline is nonexistent the plot is hopeless the acting ranges from bad to average and in the end the film just isnt funnyi could lament about why black men dont make very convincing beauty queens or why the story is so utterly hopeless but lets face it thats not what films like these are for the reason this movie is so bad is that it really isnt funny unless youre a ten year old girl im trying to remember any really good laughs i had but i cant there just werent any what i do remember is cleaning my glasses and rubbing my eyes a lot during this film which is something i use as an excuse to myself for not having to look at the screen some of the scenes were excruciating i pride myself on being able to watch bad movies to the very end but i contemplated walking out on this flick several times and spent the rest of the time wishing i had intermission came as a liberation i never thought id say this  but even dodgeball the movie wasnt this bad at least that film had some good laughs i would have given it 210 if i could think of any redeeming features but i couldnt so its 110,comedy
i have been a huge fan of the wayans brothers since in living color and have seen dont be a menace and im gonna git you sucka at least 15 times each given the premise i wasnt expecting to be the greatest work of the brothers but i wasnt expecting it to be one of the worst films i have ever seen eitherthis film is just plain awful the only people laughing in the cinema were a couple of 11 year old girls sitting nearby i could sit here and write an essay on why this film is so bad but i dont want to relive the experience of sitting through it trust me its that badif you are only familiar with the scary movie films and want to see more of the wayans brothers then hire out im gonna git you sucka at least you will laugh,comedy
im going to tell you about the problem with this movie  i understand if you like this film but i got this as a free rental i work in a bb video store what can i say  i picked this up with no real knowledge of any of the waylen brothers however its spelt previous endeavours but im none too impressed reading a few postings about this film there seems to be a debate surrounding whether this film is racistsexist  i would say that it isnt really powerful enough of a film to be either for a film to be influentially racist or sexist it needs to have some sort of ideological backbone  a point  and this film seems to lack any realistic intellectual or even emotional or moral grounding an argument is that this is comedy and we should just accept the outlandish premise purely for the sake of jest alone sadly it doesnt deliver on that front either in my opinion so what do we see and learn about the imagined reality of the world within we learn that wealthy american girls are stereotypically air headed and image obsessed hands up how many people knew this representation already from better films like clueless also as members of the fbi these two realistically would have to be professionals if someone scratches their nose or lip the fbi would not really batt too much of an eyelid when really concerned with the task of protecting two wealthy girls from a kidnapper but in this film these two blunderers take up an elaborate scheme to cover for this ok tis a comedy but as the film progresses the plot structure vanishes  we have to ask the question why are they doing this again maybe im asking too much from this film but when i saw the promotional matter for this film i thought it may have something to say about the relationships between race and gender instead all it does is reestablish what we already know  that it might be an unusual or even a possibly funny experience for a black man to have to hide out as a rich woman and that they may not adjust well a better film would be about somebody doing this and actually trying to be convincing alright  im getting tired of ranting  but this film actually has more to say about the portrayal of women  when the two girls grimace at having to engage in feminine activities is that not saying to the male audience god isnt it great that we arent like that especially in reference to the display of overt emotion rather than the two leads learning about the world they are experiencing or even trying to understand it they treat it as an excuse to prove that girls cant jump who is this film made for its definitely not women thats for sure ideological analysis aside the performances are weak the jokes rubbish and the visuals unconvincing  and the musical score aside from the official pop music soundtrack is horrifically mickey mouse i also miss the days of films being written in english  im not just a booty call ah i tell you what watch the film and see how many shades of puke you can find concealed within i found approximately twentyseven ta ta,comedy
i left the theatre in tears soooooo awful on so many levels i dont even think i can articulate how terrible this piece of garbage is i was expecting stupid funny but this was just wrong i feel as if i fell for a very cruel trick and got cheated out of 850 i thought hey scary movie was funny right this might not be so bad sweet lord was i wrong the situation itself of two black men corssdressing as socialites was the only thing that could have been potentially comical about this movie in fact it was what drew me in to see it in the first place i expected a few paris hilton jokes or something anything even remotely funny the wayans or their writers rather did absolutely nothing with a situation which could have provided for a least some meager laughs instead all they could come up with were fart jokes for the love of god do not waste your money,comedy
my godwhat have we done to have a plague like this wrought upon us this was by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen there will be no spoilers hereinso some references will be kind of vague as comedies go the jokes are few and far between you almost wonder at times if this was supposed to be a comedy or just a stupid movie then in a few parts the jokes or scenes were too drawn out if it was a funny scene they would kill it by keeping the scene going in other times it seemed to be just pointless filler as films go what happened here there were at least 2 scenes edited for the worse from the trailers to the final product in fact one scene that was changed the editing was so horrendous that the quality of the picture looked like someone was using a home movie camera then when the scene went back to the originalit went back to normal then there were at least two scenes in which the microphone is just hanging in the middle of the screen considering the wayans family has been in this business since at least the late 1980syou think they would have this down pata poor comedy with just as bad bad filming and editing this rates a whole 2  10 from me,comedy
i dont often go out of my way to write comments but for this i had to just to warn anyone that might think that by watching this they will see a comedy this doesnt come close while the premise change in colourgenderwhatever is bad enough and has been done better many times beforethe actual transformation of two black guys into two girls is one of the least convincing transformations ever put on screen it would be bad enough if all that was required by the script was a change to however the wayans brothers are required to disguise themselves as two specific women as you will have guessed by now they fail completely i have seen drag queens without makeup make more convincing women than these two do with the best special effects and makeup people that hollywood can provide its appalling add to the mix a basketball player built like a building terrible dialogue and more plot holes than a golf course and this film hits a new personal low and i like bad movies avoid like the plague,comedy
the newest intellectually insulting gut buster from the wayans brothers shawn and marlon is about as funny as a route canal and as entertaining as when steven seagal takes a minute or two out of his films to go on boring rants stressing the importance of global peace and political equalitythe wayans were previously responsible for scary movie which was funny not because it was brilliant but rather because it was risqu at the risk of being grotesque and funny at the risk of being offensive the sequel was simply grotesque and offensiveis worse than scary movie 2 because at least that film had the unpc antics like chris elliots deformed hand that were moderately shocking the pg13 is simply infantile and ridiculous  bringing to mind other films such as the hot chick that are similarly rooted in an unbelievable storyline dulled by banal and unrealistic characterstake for example the role fulfilled by the hapless john heard his acting defines the expression phoning in the performance he looks out of exhausted lost and bewildered his character is given little to no background introduction  he suddenly appears and disappears just as quicklyor how about the protagonists do we really know who they are apart from a pathetic throwaway exploitation of their home life clichs include being a cop who is always late for everything the wife who is worried about her husband and is upset he never calls her or makes it home on time the bachelor whos looking for love the movie pretty much just skips forward right into the ploti know not all comedies need extensive character backdrops but even other slapstick buddy films like dumb and dumber took the time to introduce their characters and make them distinct i walked away from not really knowing the differences between the two main characters,comedy
basically this is an overlong unfunny actioncomedy first of all id like to say that i did enjoy the wayans brother scary movie 1 and the sequel had its moments unfortunately doesnt even deliver half the laughs the humour in it is absolutely crude if you like burping farting stupid catchphrases you should probably look at this when it isnt crude its idiotic the first 10 minutes of the film gave everything away to me totally unfunny simply idiotic however i watched the whole thing since i was with a friend otherwise i wouldnt have bothered the story is undeniably thin it was in scary movie too but there at least the laughs were quick and constant i think this is probably one of the main problems too with this film the laughs dont come quick enough some jokes are dragged out too long when theyre more disgusting than funny in the first place if you prefer your comedy with a few brain cells then just avoid this if you want a silly comedy with more laughs then look at scary movie airplane hotshots 1  2 110 completely unfunny thin storyline a film that seems to be based on one idea ie what if we dressed up as for a film but simply didnt have enough material,comedy
this wasnt a terrible film but its humor will only appeal to certain people if you think someone saying oh no you didnt while waving their finger is still funny or you find toilet humor amusing then youll laugh at this film otherwise stay away the humor is very unsophisticated and will do little than inspire the occasional smile the only good thing about this movie was the latrell character who was perfect for the role and did an excellent job for the record im not sure who thought this movie was racist or why its called satire get a grip well thats all i had to say but the guidelines say i must write at least 10 lines so enjoy this extra line at no charge ,comedy
this is the single worst movie i have ever seen i can only thank god that i didnt waste my own money watching this crap omit about 35 seconds of funny moments and you have the most inane assine boring stupid movie ever this movie makes not another teen movie look oscar worthy it was that bad i dont know what else to say but this is crap if you wanna know more about the plot etc read other posts because im not going to waste my time covering it if you actually enjoyed this movie i implore you to stand up and justify yourself and people giving this a 10 come on im shocked its not on the hundred worst of all time list yet 1 out 10 if you must watch this i suggest you borrow from some poor sucker who actually paid to rent or even worse bought it because i wouldnt waste my money on it,comedy
good idea for a movie awful execution the makeup is indeed excellentthey make the two black guys look like ugly girls unfortunately it seems the producers thought that was enough for making the movie interesting the plot is just so badit is just a succession of not so funny gags and some intestinal humor meaning farts come on they built a character on paris hilton and could not come up with at least a hundred very funny jokes  even paris in real life is funnier than their clones in the movieis it possible that people dont get tired of so many movies with rich teenage girlsyuck  skip this one,comedy
this is the worst horror movie ive ever seen i admit that its scary but its not a fun kind of scary its depressing and makes you hate lifeshawn and marlon wayans play kevin and marcus copeland two wildly incompetent fbi agents who impersonate a pair of hotel heiresses in order to uncover a kidnapping scheme the comedy  or the horror  arises out of these black new yorkers attempts to mimic spoiled girlsthey fool everyone even the girls intimate friends this despite that their latex masks make them look like the living dead i noticed that the real girls mom has a hideous stretchedout face but we get only fleeting glimpses of her my guess is there were some gags involving plastic surgery that got cut from the movie when someone realized that the mother still looks better than the wayans brothersnow i can suspend my disbelief for anything  even the idea that tall black men in zombie makeup look like cute but the movie doesnt seem to want to help me the wayans characters  and thus the wayans themselves  seem very uncomfortable committing to their parts when they first don their getups these blithering idiots are mystified and furious when guys hit on them kevin or is it marcus drops his drawers and nearly moons them before he realizes hes disguised as a woman boingthis kind of hyperbolic stupidity infects every character without exception and makes spending two years sic with them an ordeal maybe once or twice by sheer chance something funny happens marcus has an insanely jealous wife who complains of waiting up for him all night even though its only 802 and hes two minutes late i laughed but writerdirector keenan ivory wayans must have included this joke by accident hes more interested in flatulence dildos and homosexual panic meanwhile the people and types skewered in this movie come off like parodies of cartoons of parodies  seven degrees separated from any actual peoplei just noticed that i wrote two years instead of two hours i swear to you thats a real typo when i tell you i hate this comedy i mean it,comedy
do movie producers really think we are this stupidi have been seeing previews for this horrifyingly bad movie almost nonstop it makes me wonder what kind of idiot would want to go see a movie like this 1 men dressing up as women to solve a crime is no longer funny was it ever its been done about a million times 2 the people are so lame jokes are played out and no longer funny in fact theyre offensive yeah they might have been funny when eddie murphey did them in the 80s or when richard pryor did them before that or when red foxx did them before thati guess the notalent wayans brothers thought everyone would think that hip black guys dressing up as lame women would make for a hillarious combination it doesnt and i dont even have to go see the movie to make that statement simple turn on the wb and watch how people are portrayed in every sitcom its rude and its offensive and if the table was turned there would be outrage and men dressing up as women hasnt been funny since tootsie was it even funny then,comedy
spoiler alert spoiler alerton a mad crazy whim i checked out this movie with a female friend of mine we had just finished off a pitcher of margaritas at a mexican restaurant and decided to pop over to the mall to see what was playing we had mentioned seeing day after tomorrow but when we got there somehow seemed like the more logical choice we realized we werent drunk enough to enjoy the movie so we scrambled to find a bar luckily there was a restaurant nearby so we went up to the bar and each had a double shot of tequila we ran back upstairs and settled in for some action if i had sat down without the tequila swimming in my brain i would have run screaming from the theater after ten minutesis awful i mean it stinks to high heaven i was wishing i had a large tub of popcorn so i could jam my head into it and suffocate on the kernels this movie was an abomination there was one scene where one of the has a bathroom emergency and farts up a thunderstorm the audience i was with laughed their heads off it was then that i knew i was in movie hellthe guy playing the chick hungry black guy was the only thing funny about this movie his date with his rubbermasked chick had me laughing a little other than that i was just sitting there hoping the projector would explode unfortunately the movie kept rolling but eventually came to an end upon leaving the theater my friend and i agreed that was one of the worst movies of the year if not the decade i was screaming my lungs out in the parking lot the tequila did not help make the movie funny or good or tolerableso remember this important safety tip dont drive drunk to the movies there was an accident this time and the wreck was called ,comedy
well i think of myself as a person with a strong sense of humor who simply love comedies especially if watched with a group of friends so we decided to take a look at this onewhat a mistake after half of the movie movie one of them fell a sleep one went home and one laughed why may i ask maybe because he is twelveanyway theres nothing wrong with the main cast they did their job ok especially the guy who played latrell spencer its the story that is so unbelievable and almost an insult for a intelligent viewerdespite that i have to admit that i had a few laughs during it but that wasnt enough to rate this one higher than2 out of 10,comedy
if this movie was changed to black chicks and had a cast pretending to be black this would have been thrown out of theaters there would have been demands for apology and cnn would be covering the aftermath but since it is black folks in face totally acceptablei dont care how funny anybody thinks this movie is it is the perfect example of racism that isnt seen as racism because it is black folks doing it to folksthe makers of this movie should be made to apologize and it should be removed from any store shelvesif you found this movie funny and cannot see how racist it is well then you are the problem,comedy
this was a complete and total waste of my time when i watched this trainwreck all that i could think was instead of bringing fbi makeup artist to make to black guys look like why not just use their skill to cover the scratches on the two womens nose and mouth not only did marlon and shawn wayons not look anything like two young girls but the plot was terrible obvious and not funny at all i was expecting to laugh at some subconscience hidden nugget of funny but was sadly disappointed the little fool who goaded me into watching this hunk of crap tried to convince me that the poop scene was funny but it was obvious played out and way too immature i would like to see hollywood finally accept that crossdressing comedies especially interracial crossdressing comedies are just as played out and not funny as matrix parodies and star wars i am your father lines i was disappointed because i was pleased with scary movie and giggled at the sequel but this was awful and i knew that going into it what a hunk of crap,comedy
i suppose i shouldnt write a review as i left twenty minutes into this film however i will at least comment on principlethis film was doomed from the start the alreadyridiculous story was  surprisingly  accented by terrible acting from the wayans brothers themselvesa film of this nature is directed entirely at preteenage girls who can relate to the ditzes on screen i was embarrassed to appear in the theater that it was playing ini give the film one star on effort hopefully the wayans know what theyre really doing with their career,comedy
my friends and i planned on going to see a movie on a saturday night  the movie came up and i was adamant on not seeing the movie  it was your stereotypical comedy bland tasteless grossout humour and stupid jokes that made no sense  i didnt even see the movie and i knew that  yet everyone insisted on seeing it so instead of seeing fahrenheit 911 spiderman 2 or even anchorman  we saw this  it lived up to my very low expectations  the people that were laughing the loudest were the three children sitting in front of me during the flatulence scenes  this movie is tired old and predictable  no wonder the wayans are being sued half the movie is ripped from other popular comedies  just save your money and do not watch this  my friends owe me a coke for not laughing during this snoozefest,comedy
t crews was perfect the rest were in a race to see whom could overact the most the people down the row from me were funnier i almost walked out before terry came on the first 35 minutes were very slow and yet did not set up anything of significance the plot was forgotten and very weak the makeup was forgettable and not close to reality the wayans should be given awards for being able to verbalize the script  if there was a script  from scene to scene the action was just not effective nor creative the slapstick was really bad and the serious moments were not alive partially because the funny stuff just did not work terry crews was the only bright spot other than the end,comedy
let me just say firstly the title of the movie was wrong it obviously made people assume that the film was about the differences between black and people i would say about less than ten of the jokes out of the film containing tens upon tens of funny lines was about the racial differencesit was about men learning about what women go through in life they get to experience different people that women encounter such as strong overpowering men rude devious women fashion shopping waxes ouch etcbut instead of making you feel like youre being lectured they make you laugh and learn insteadthe wayans are not making fun of people theyre mocking people such as the hiltons the false life that people like them can lead how money can hide people from reality and can lead to corruptionon the dvd you can see for yourself what the actresses have to say that they enjoyed themselves and love the concept who would join a cast who were making fun of your race if the wayans disliked people so much they wouldve gotten black actorsactresses and put them under makeup instead of hiring actorsactresses in the first place even the director states that this film is about the differences between men and womenplease give this film the same chance that you would give any otherps was mrs doubtfire making fun of old people,comedy
i saw the movie 10 times and it remains my personal third favorite movie of all time its full of laughter and fun exactly what we need in movies to the wayans keep up the great work i love them in scary movies they have certainly done wonders with movies in these days when we all are trying to get things that are considered offensive out of our movies gotta askhow can they get away with it remains very offensive because of one major thing if it is illegal for whites to go in black face how is it legal for blacks to go in face but i would have to say this as long as it is a movie like who cares keep up the great work and ill forever be a major fan of the wayans,comedy
 the idea being of course for the wayans brothers to somehow need to disguise themselves as the title suggests since in the real world this would be a situation that no sensible person would possibly get themselves into the reasons for such action to be taken are of course highly implausible thats not what im here to complain about though i knew the idea going in but i had hoped that they could still make the best use of it with the aid of charming performances and comical situations im still hoping  no incentive exists for any sane person to watch this at allthere have been accusations of racism thrown around since this film was released i dont want to get into that what i will say however is that altering ones skin colour for laughs isnt funny these days because its not sophisticated it has nothing to do with whether or not it might be offensive but timing and techniques have moved on in such a way that you have to work harder to get a laugh now if you went down to a comedy club and there was an act there that used either boot polish or chalk to discolour themselves youd likely expect more thought to have gone into the routine than such a simplistic process on its own youd be looking for some meaning or else quickfire gags in addition to it if theres any rationale behind this plot at all its to spoof the airhead princess social type this species is so annoying however that id much rather get rid of them altogether than even make fun of themlike the characters the humour is shrill and grating making it all but impossible to identify in any way with the performers or to even chuckle slightly at the misadventures that are concocted ill be honest i enjoyed the original scary movie but im still wholly unconvinced about the ability of the brothers to garner genuine laughs from an idea of solid construction as opposed to relying on skits im not saying it to incite fans of this movie or to exaggerate my point  but i can honestly say that this has been one of the only instances in all my time of watching movies where the experience has actually pained me inside,comedy
i thought this film disappointed its preview ratings it was made out to be a huge film yet turned out pretty pathetic i couldve sworn i saw people walking out of the cinemait really was that bad had i have not been with a large group of friends i would have seriously been contemplating leaving the best bit had to have been the first part of the film where the agents made a huge mistake and spoiled a chance of arresting some drug associated people and that wasnt even that funny i mean how can i explain a film that bored me so much i fell asleep the only few reasons i went to see the film were i had nothing better to do wanted to see my friends and the film had a high rating well i think people should learn to judge a lil better and as i said with my nothing better to do i seriously think i shouldve stayed at home  that way i wouldve been bored with somewhere comfortable to fall asleep i dont think you should see the film as you would either die of boredom cry of shame because you went to see such a bad film or fall asleep because it is rubbish,comedy
this movie is utterly ridiculous from the stupid storyline to the worst makeup job ive ever seen in a film they look like two people wearing horrible puffy masks they look ridiculous they dont look real they dont look like at all and they especially dont look at all like the two girls theyre trying to impersonate they stand out like a sore thumb now i know some people are going to try to argue that its just a movie just enjoy it well whats to enjoy im insulted that someone would actually expect me to just accept that these two people are supposed to be passed off as girls all i would say to you is shame on you the only thing thats funny about this film is the fact that we are expected to believe that two people could pass themselves off as with that makeup i feel sorry for anyone stupid enough to even want to see something like this have some respect for yourself and see something worth seeing youll be stupider just by watching this travesty of a film,comedy
i am beginning to question imdbs ratings anymore with the way this movie is rated i just cant fathom how anyone thinks this movie is hilarious or that the makeup makes the characters convincing seriously the upfront first page review here on imdb as the featured review is more funny than this movie as i read how great the review said the movie is that is truly laughablei unfortunately chose to believe these positive reviews here and wasted my time watching this flick as a result i suggest you dont make the same mistakei like the wayans family comedy work usually but this movie is terriblenot because it is racistpeople need to get over themselves on the race hangups and have fun with our differences comedians have done this for a long timefor me going back to flip wilson and it can be really funny no matter what color you are if you actually have a sense of humor which is harder to find in todays pc paranoid younger generationshoweverthis movie is just a terribly produced and acted movie i love these kinds of simple minded flicks and i may have laughed out loud once watching this its like they tried to capitalize on the success of the tyler perry series of movies and failed miserably not that tyler perrys movies are much better than this onethis was a total waste of my time and i watch some stupid stuff and usually like it,comedy
the wayans brothers  keenen ivory wayans directorcoscreenwriter together with shawn and marlon wayans lead starscoscreenwriter  work together in a buddy cop comedy that one can only describe as obviousunfunny and sillyit tells a story of brothers and fellow fbi agents marcus and kevin copeland who disguised themselves as caucasian female who agree to escort socialite sisters brittany and tiffany wilton from the airport at jfk airport to their hotel room in the hamptons as both are being targeted by a serial kidnapperthey did this to renew the confidence of the higher ups after a drug bust they messed up as regular guysone can only see that it provides nothing else except unfunny jokesraunchy humor that could be classified as bathroom jokes and a brainless social commentaryit only does nothing except insult the viewers intelligence and nothing more,comedy
without doubt the worst film i have ever had the misfortune to watch the plot if you can call it that is totally lacking in originality the acting is totally lacking in credibility the comedy is absolutely awful this film is not racist it is not clever enough to be so even racists who are disgusting are not as stupid as this film im not sure what the wayans have done in the past but surely they have no future part but not all of the problem is that the wayans have to big an involvement in the film it may have been improved if it had been directed by a n other but understandably nobody else would have put their reputation on the line for this rubbish having read other peoples reviews i understand that i am in the minority at least in this forum but i am entitled to my opinion if you are in any doubt about my judgement watch it and make your own mind up but dont say i didnt warn you,comedy
hold on why couldnt they have dressed as black chicks oh yeah they wouldnt look different at all can anyone give me one wayans movie where they havent dressed up as ladies dont be a menace doesnt count jack and michael costanza ghost wrote that the other norton trio members acted as directorsin theres never really any jokes its just the wayans acting like girls for 2 hours theres no setups no punchlines and no laughs there is a lot of i think im gonna play some time crisis 3 at least for me there was 5 times to be exactsomebody has to tell kenan ivory damon marlon shawn damien the only talented one kim rakeesha george w and osama bin wayans to stop making movies its only hurting the ozone layerverdict 12 out of ,comedy
i saw this at the drive in it was a double feature with spiderman 2 which was excellent i debated wether to stay for it or not and decided to check it outi had extremely low expectations for this movie and was surprised it was allot better than i thought it would be   occasionally i like to take in a dumb movie but there is funny dumb and there is lame dumb im happy to report that this was funny dumb not as funny dumb as say dumb and dumber or stuck on you but still not as insulting as i thought itd bethere were a few jokes where you groaned but in the most part this was an enjoyable moviescott,comedy
2004 dir keenan ivory wayans  cast shawn wayans marlon wayans jaime king john heard terry crews the first problem with this film is that neither shawn nor marlon wayans look convincing as females they are black cops undercover out to protect two really dumb blondes from becoming the victims of a kidnapping so they undertake a massive makeup job to resemble the two girls sounds funny but it isnt convincing here it suggests attitude and race in dealing with women and placing males in their shoes some like it hot and tootsie handled this theme much more convincingly the concept isnt new and its structure is one lewd sexual joke after another that grows thin quickly directed by keenan ivory wayans who made the equally lewd yet funnier scary movie but here he transcends none of that talent part of the problem is that it seems as if he found the concept of shawn and marlon in drag to be funny on its own shawn and marlon frail when under the makeup horrible supporting performances by jaime king and john heard terry crews has the embarrassing opportunity to stalk marlon wayans for a little touchy feely action the film is tailored as the umpteenth male in drag comedy that has been done to death and this rates as about the worst it can get the two blondes should have been kidnapped off the set score 1  10,comedy
keenan ivory wayans is probably one of the worst directors i swear he has no real knowledge on how to make films he has made one brilliant film and that is scary movie scary movie 2 was ok too but everything else keenan has made are real disasters avoid such titles like dont be a menace to south central while drinking your juice in the hood i know what a title  obviously this film too just anything that has keenans name in the creditsit was an hour and a half on stupid nonsense that never made me laugh just trust me on this maybe women might like this film a little because of some of things that happen but on a whole this film will never be liked by anyone with a good taste in films 110jd seaton,comedy
hey fellows this flick is a laughter riot and i an wondering why only 5 stars this is too bad huh this movie deserves more than that it contains hell lot of comedy action music dance and thrill as well i loved the content and its not less people should not do injustice to such movie in which you can find every ingredient for entertainment i thoroughly enjoyed it  i would recommend if anyone missed it both brothers had done well and its so much interesting from the beginning to end and ive given it 8 points out of 10 why would not you go for a movie which gives you 100 per cent return of your money i love it love it love,comedy
i can understand some people in particular the ones who havent watched this film find its content offensive but to be fair the wayans kept it pretty cleantwo cops shawn  marlin find themselves almost out of a job due to a failed setup the only way to secure their jobs is pose as two rich and girls maitland ward anne dudek and solve a huge crime in the mean timeso the guys have a couple of cracks about the rich society so what what the movie is truly lacking are some better jokes i mean weve seen enough movies where a person uhm really has to go to bathroom and stuff410,comedy
this is highly degrading to whites and women if this is not racist  then neither is amos and andy they need to allow reruns of amos and andy which were far funnier than these two hopeless actors if we are no longer allowed to do black face because it is politically incorrect then there should be no face like the kind done by eddie murphy and wayans if amos and andy are not allowed to be shown then neither should this silly movie i personally would prefer to have more freedom for all artists keep in mind that amos and andy which are now non grata was not a group of actors doing black face but a group of very talented blacks doing real comedy without having to sink themselves to the low gross language that the wayans use the boys should have half the talent of alvin childress spencer williams tim moore and the rest of the cast of amos and andy,comedy
back together where they should be marlon and shawn are a couple of paris hilton type chicks i didnt see this movie until it hit television i dont even know why i heard it was funny i saw the previews in the theater but missed this in the cinema too bad for me although even still it was hilarious on the tube my wife who is tougher to please in movie comedy than i am and we both laughed to side splitting degrees from the past titles of wayans brothers films this fell right into perfect place this was directed by keenan who is a comedy whiz kid anyway he a has always had my sense of humor i felt for years since  im gonna git you sucka  he has put some of the funniest and best most entertaining programs i can remember there is something a little different about the delivery and explanation of a story that is written and directed by keenan and his family but from the dark roots and the blond attitude this is a comedy with a foul and funny pitch the mo was right down shawn and marlons alley they had these two better than the real two themselves the valley girl hampton charity party martini crowd was a overprivileged good time the fbi should be so lucky to have two as fine as these chickfellows this is a really fun filled two hours that will not leave you let down the story is fresh and filled with wayan good humorthese two blonds with dark roots can kick and punch too ,comedy
once in a while you rent the wrong movie it just happened to me i remembered seeing the trailers for and thinking that it would probably be hilarious boy was i wrong believe it or not i was actually in a good mood before watching it by the end of it i was cursing and thanking imdb for giving me an outlet to vent my anger at having spent valuable cash on this junk the wayans should really thank whoever they hired to stitch up the trailer from this junk that guy really did an amazing job although to give credit where it is due one must also consider that i am very naive and get easily sucked into a goodlooking traileryou cant really blame any of the actors as the jokes dont really fall flat because of their lack of conviction or lack of believability the script is just not funny considering that theres not much action story drama or substance theres just not much left is there terry crews manages to steal the show it must be said in all fairness in all of his scenes so come to think of it he either is getting better material than the others or delivers it betterthank god i did not make the terrible mistake of watching this one at the theaters but even for a rental it is very disappointing it isnt even bad enough to be funny in itself the only way i managed to remain awake during was by thinking of the various ways that i would express my disappointment in this review and that says a lot about me and the quality of this movie stay away from this unless you want to know i how not to make a comedy or ii you feel bad for terry crews and want to see how one can stand out amazingly from a terrible movie do not rent or buy it unless i youre a vegetable ii youre not actually planning on watching itshawn wayans kevin copeland  410  should stay away from his brothers movies and do his own thingmarlon wayans marcus copeland  410  should stay away from his brothers movies and do his own thingterry crews latrell spencer  910  fantastic in a losing causekeenen ivory wayans  210  should be ashamed of this at some point when it is this bad regardless of the amount of money you have spent on a movie you have to have the decency to pull the plug for your credibilitys sake,comedy
after watching the adverts i thought this film looked racist and a pile of crap which is unfair this film is not racist it is however a pile of crapi think the people who find this funny must have had a lobotomy what a waste of money this film is i am so sick of crappy films like this that have a weak story and even weaker jokes i guess i must be asking too much to watch a comedy thats smart and funny i would also like to point out that the only reason i went to see this was because it was my sisters birthday shes 12 and thought it was mindless crud a lot of americas comedies dont appeal to me to be honest they usually involve slapstick to make up for the fact that they are not funny i think ill stick with the league of gentlemen hilarious tv show and little britaindont watch it its two hours of your life youll never get back you have been warned is a forgetful pile of poo,comedy
 aka the hilton sisters spoof not since tootsie have we seen worse drag bathroom humor galore with a hip sound track of soontobeforgotten hits tear up a 10 bill and you still have 2 unused hours of life to spend with something better watch and lose both money and timedont look for any oscar nominations for the miraclemakeup that turned two goodlooking caramelbrown actors into lilythe corncobfuzz hair is actually worse than going bald you decide on all of the above i dont recommend this film only a cardcarrying fan of the stars will insist on suffering through this mess of a comedy,comedy
i just saw this film today and i have to say that i did laugh a few times during the film there was only one other person in the theatre for this particular screening one thing that really bothered me was the awful camera angles which cut off the actors at their chins showing quite a bit of space above them there was also the very noticeable appearance of the microphone boom in several of the scenes fart humor although funny at times loses its punch with repetition this movie was funnybut in terms of grades id have to say wait for it to come on hbo and save your 2000 the film appeared to be a hurried knock off with lousy camera direction and apparent lack of editing for what could have been a hilarious film grade d,comedy
horrifying cringe inducing retch worthy disgusting it sounds like im describing a horror movie but unfortunately im notive never given a film the rating of 1 and i hope i never have to again now to make any film good you have to at least believe the premise not for a second did i believe the main characters looked like women never mind the women they were supposed to look like every character in the film had to play complete idiots so the film could move forwardsome people think this movie is a masterpiece or a smart comedy all i have to say is those people need to see a lot more movies or get out of their preteens before having a viable opinionthe first 10 minutes i thought it might have some promise but each scene got worse and worse until the ending i actually felt shame and embarrassment watching this film and im not even the ones who made this i dont mind the wayans comedy scary movie in living color but this is just inept the reason i havent mentioned the acting or the plot is because the only good thing about it is some of the songs on the soundtrack arent to baddont buy dont rent dont see just dont,comedy

in all fairness i checked my brain at the door to enjoy i would not have enjoyed it and probably would have walked out from boredom if not anger had i not done so is it just me or do the wayans just look strange playing the girls robin williams pulled it off even martin lawrence pulled it off to some degree but the wayans fell flat on their facesa kidnapping scheme is underway and two fbi agents dress up as the victims to figure out who is behind it problem is the black cops are now and have to blend inyou know what im lying i hated this movie in a sea of predictability overproduction wasted scenes boring unfunny moments with typical boring dumb bad guys with the most unoriginal ideas to ever pop up this side of black knight  you know what  i have to say it its driving me nuts make a really good black movie seriously the only good black movie to pop up in my head with the exception of a good classic poitiers raisin in the sun is how high movies like this frustrate the heck out of me and if someone does not wake up and smell the hummus im going to go nuts,comedy
for the wayans brothers to drop the ball as badly as they did in this movie was completely unexpected at least to me this idea was original although not very realistic enough to have great potential but the movie well i tried to sleep just so that i could let my wife enjoy it if you have seen the american pie trilogy then you have already seen a lot of the jokes in this movie up to and including the danceoff i went into this movie with low expectations and ended up giving it too much credit my personal advice if you have a choice between this movie and gangreneid go with the infection and possible dismemberment but thats just myopinion i could be wrong,comedy
basically its another comedy with a far fetched plot but is still entertaining its about two screwup fbi agents who dress up as two socialites for a weekend because the real girls get a scratch on their face due to another screwup and dont want to be seen in public so many of the jokes are fishoutof water type from pop music to skin tight pants and there is this nba player who continually hits on one of them those scenes were pretty funny especially when he finds out shes a guy all he can say is you arent then they have a dance off between rival socialites that was funnyfinal verdict not to bad at least it had some funny parts,comedy
seemingly a comedy film released in 2004 which had several strings of success the plot for the film is routine taking several different elements from your basic bumbling buddy cop plot the real life brother are forced to don the guise of wealthy socialites after they bungle a routine babysitting gig has seemed to have hit a pop culture status where the film has grown over the years since its release although the film been heavily panned by most critics and released lackluster reviews the film is not has bad as many reviews claim though it depends on the comedy one enjoys it is not great neither and not as funny as its fans claim the film is quite odd and predictable and over the top but given the plot it is what one would expect,comedy
i have to admit at first i wasnt too fond of this movie but after some minutes i started to understand and love it maybe it does not appeal to everyone but this movie be actin great n shait move b1tchi cant figure out why the low rating ive seen it 3 times and it is one of my absolute favorites among comedies it has a lot of ebonics humor and from time to time it be acting all hilarious sure youd have to have a sense of humor to appreciate it and be a bit immaturei guess it is the same guys who put one flew over the cuckoos nest on top250sure the movie is rather good but what it is doing on 12 beats me who turned this movie down i do mean to offend anyone,comedy
i saw this movie yesterday with my friends jess and mandi i usually go to a movie every couple of weeks and so far i have seen mean girls harry potter 3 shrek 2 the day after tomorrow thirteen going on 30 and of course i enjoyed most of the movies but i didnt really like that muchdifferent people are going to have different opinions for example jess loved it she thought it was the funniest comedy in the world that even the rude and racial humor was hilarious mandi thought it was pretty funny but she wished that there was a little more understandable storyline and she got a little offended as for me i thought it was soso okay whatever not a movie that i will ever want to see again not something that i will probably even remember there were a few cheap laughs but the humor was well not my style it could have been a lot betterbut thats like saying i could have been 5 richer if i hadnt bothered to see the movie in the first placeoverall you have to see this movie for yourself to decide because ive read a lot of mixed reviews and depending on who you are and what type of movies you like you will either love or hate this movie,comedy
i dont understand why there is such support for this movie i think its because shawn and marlon wayans have an unrequited loyal fanbase who support two actors that only want to create lazy cheap comedies theres hardly any real jokes in this movie instead you get clichd genderswap gags that have been done better in older movies for example a manin drag gets mad and sounds masculine everyone looks at him confused man indrag then talks in silly feminine voice then the onceconfused people laugh it off as just a rare quirk this happens too many times in this movie and youll see every one of them coming there are no likable characters instead everyone seems incompetent stupid obnoxious with the only tolerable being those who dont have a lot of lines or screentime the only other kind of jokes are overly contrived and unrealistic sequences forcing the wayans brothers to feel uncomfortable and worry that their cover will be blown who cares if they lose their job at the fbi they never demonstrate why they deserve it in the first place none of the gags work because theyre poorly written with no comedic timing and they happen to characters we dont care aboutim not asking for this movie to make some powerful statement on the human condition i dont expect some highbrow masterpiece of cinema that reaches into my core the least i expect are likablerelatableendearing characters funny situations that happen to said characters believable situations interesting developments in a story and i dont want to be annoyed this movie has none of those things and almost derides you for expecting them many of this movies fans sure deride you for that instead of this watch a comedy that has respect for you doesnt insult your intelligence and actually has some effort put into it,comedy
i must have an odd sense of humor but i bought his dvd after seeing it and still laugh my head off when i watch it i thought it was a great spoof as an undercover cop comedy the wayan brothers are terrific actors in my opinion i have seen much worse they have a great sense timing and i think are hilarious sure their makeup as the two rich twin is a little off but that is excellent work to look and act like those rich chicks given these two girls attitude and demeanor in the beginning of the film before the wayans went undercover posing as them latrel was really great schwartzenegroat any rate i loved spaceballs too and many people didnt like that either if you can imagine that the people in this movie really cant tell these chicks are imposterswhich is pretty obvious and have an odd sense of humor then youll love it ,comedy
always nice to see another wayans movie it comes close to the humor of monty python not yet the absurd and satire but that is what makes monty python so unique these guys have their own style which has been and im sure it will keep on being funny as hell well the first scene is hilarious they should make a movie about those two old geezers but what made me utterly gasping for air and producing a backache from laughing is the toilet scene man this is even better than dumb  dumbers farting scene off course this level of humor is to be found throughout the entire movie nonstop jokes about anything and anyone they dont centralize any specific group they just make fun about everyone and everything their acting is so good it makes you wonder how some celebrities are where they are now and the makeup and prostheses are really well done this is a mustsee movie brilliant cant wait what will come next from this talented group,comedy
was a breath of fresh air it took you away from all the gore and drama of most of the latest films this movie gave you a real chance to just sit back and laugh it didnt matter if the plot was right or if all the actors could in deed act it was what it wasfunnymarlon and shawn have proved to be great actors in whatever role the chose to take maybe this movie was so funny because it was so unexpected they give a whole new meaning to the word versatile talent is truly a gift not a learned skill i hope they had as much fun making it as i did watching it congrads mr wayans on a job well done well thats my opinion anyway,comedy
i loved this film  all of it  from the start to the finish  i cant say there is one part that i found boring or not quite as good as the rest of it  i stayed planted to my chair as did my children for the duration of the running time  so that says a lot about a movie itself  as for the humor stakes  think of deuce bigalow or something similar and multiply it by 10  its certainly one of the funniest movies ive seen in a very long time  the combination of the wayans brothers went together so well and they made the perfect acting team  i hope they do lots more comedies together on the same scale as this one  the entire cast of this movie was awesome and each character brought their own little bit of comedy into the movie  i thoroughly enjoyed the storyline and granted it may have been a little clich such as copsgood guybad guy but it went so well with the characters and they really pulled it off  it was a whole wealth of great entertainment  from the bonds of a partnershipfriendship to some of the most hilarious scenes ive ever seen  i loved every one of them  a terrific comedy well worth watching  1010,comedy
i heard this was rubbish and had my reservations about renting it but boy am i glad i didits so funnythe wayans brothers prove they really are geniuses when it comes to comedy everything is just funny and dorky theres nothing too complicated so your brain can take it easyi loved every scene the car scenes with the vanessa carlton song were brilliant one of the daniel twins from sweet valley high shows was in the film and shes not bad took me a few minutes to realise busy phillips from dawsons creek was also in the filmfor a funny no brainer film check this out i would definitely recommend it,comedy
i think thats why it got such low stars on imdb why is everyone so harsh on the film i actually laughed at most of the movie yes some of it is a little over the top silly sometimes you need that though i dont know maybe i was in one of those good moods and i couldve just liked any movie but i did think that this was very funny there are some typical moments in a man dressed as a woman comedy shawn and marlyn do make some ugly women but that is what made this movie so funny i would recommend it for a silly laugh remember just dont take it seriously come on imdb users have a little fun thats what makes movies fun and enjoyable710,comedy
the look of the movie was pretty polished the sets and costumes were goodwhen i first saw the preview i thought no way am i seeing this movie then bought the video at my teenagers insistence and i found the movie so silly it made me laugh some people have a problem with the wayans brothers in drag playing women but what about gene wilder and richard pryor richard put genes character in black face in one of their movies in a big hat with a radio boom box to his ear and then he proceeded to show genes character how to act black it was perfectly ridiculous and hilarious 2004 is a spoof loaded with satire and movie does not take itself seriously if you liked the scary movies youll like 2004,comedy
wow  first off i read the reviews on here just before sticking this one on and was dismayed and shocked to see the amount of people slagging it off all for the exact same reasons too and generally giving it the thumbs downi get the impression that the make up the wayans bros wear is disappointing to a lot of people because they arent attractive enough to fancy have you guys read what youre writing on here and looked at yourselves this film aint real and criticising the make up the guys were wearing cos you didnt think it was realistic enough is a bit daft i think its only a story a comedy and in my opinion a great film no doubt the people who dont like this will also not like im gonna git you sucka and dont be a menace to south central two more cool films or is it that people are afraid that if they say they like this film some lefty will say they are racist towards black people or some supremacist will say they are racist towards whites wow i know a guy who said dumb and dumberer was racist cos the chinese girl in it was called ching chong jeezi laughed my socks off at this film and i dont care who knows it its funny theres no point repeating the story but i will repeat this bit which is reflected in a few places on this site  latrell is the funniest character in this film and every time he appeared i was cracking up you need to get this film to see his rendition of thousand miles ha ha its cool forget what people will call you and watch it alone if you have to its only 4 quid on ebay,comedy
i have always been told i have bad taste in comedies though i would rate this like airplane naked gun  police academy types my girls and i laughed so hard when the oopsie i let a poopsie line happened didnt matter that it was predictable it was still funny we also saw this at the drive in after spider man 2 i debated to stay or go after spidey i figured the girls would fall asleep and my youngest 8 almost 9 told me she was going to go to sleep but she stayed awake the entire time i thought it was really neat how even at the drive in this movie really made people laugh out loud i found myself laughing out loud also which doesnt happen often,comedy
thats all i can say about this film is that its uglyto people who doesnt like the idea of guardians of the galaxy  mission breakout if you think that the tivan collection looks ugly in your pov then think againi think the way how the wayans look in disguise as women in the film is actually a complete eyesore its just unnecessary i understand why they have to be in disguise even according to the premise but why cant they have like female fbi that looks exactly similar to the wilson sisters instead i asked because this premise is so damn dumbalso the jokes and the humor are not even funny except for the fart scene but still i was just sitting there not laughing throughout the whole film,comedy
i have probably seen this movie at least 30 times every single time it is still fresh and funny every single time i laugh out loud the entire movie and recite my favorite lines along with the wayans brothers some gems include easy chocolate negro please ok schwartzenegro making my way downtown ooops she did it again your momma is so old when she breast feeds it looks like this dust riot i miss the wayans and hope they come out with another movie which is up to par with how there was no sequel is a mystery to mephysical comedy and timing in this movie are excellent with every character having their place while being memorablestart to finish  awesome,comedy
the movie had a few funny scenes in it i actually saw more funny scenes in the movie then i did in the previews for the movie which is a good thing some of the characters are annoying as hell but some also are very funny if youre looking for a great movie this is not it but if youre just looking for a few cheap laughs to tickle the funny bone this will probably suffice it is probably just funny enough to justify a viewing just be sure that youre in the mood for this kind of movie i like the wayans brothers they seem like pretty nice guys so im inclined to give them a favorable review there were a lot of things that could have been overdone in this type of movie like a lot of animosity between wayans and the two rival nonafrican fbi agents but they kept it at just the right level thank god i actually liked most of the scenes involving the other two fbi guys so they did a good job writing the parts for those two the latrelle spencer character was also very funny and great worth a watch probably 610,comedy
i first seen this film about ten years ago i thought it was funny but maybe a little immature it was on tv the other night and i wasnt going to watch it but after fifteen minutes i was hooked im not sure why some reviews moan that the story or make up isnt believable who cares you have to go with the silliness to enjoy the film and all the gags two black police men are under cover and pretend to be young spoiled girls is not easy to pull of but it does work and they are very very funny the character of latrell who takes a shine to one of the girls is the star of the movie he is cheesy and has the worst pick up lines he is a machine i didnt think i would enjoy this comedy as much as i did go with it,comedy
i hesitated a while before seeing this movie because of the low imdb score im glad i didnt let the low score stop me this movie is funnyas an adult you have to prepare yourself by drinking 2 glasses of wine or beer or etc but then its great it reminded me of american pie with the more err physical slapstick meaning food farts bellies and fake boobsthe black vs angle was a nice addon compared to ap the numerous movie references were well appreciated eg carrie some like it hot the rest i forgot because of the wineso take off your thinking cap and give it a go,comedy
while many may see this movie as racist and claim that filmmakers would never allow whites to make fun of blacks in such a manner i would have to say that i both agree and disagree while the movie contains a great deal of bigotry i wouldnt call it racism as the meaning of that badly misused word is the belief that race accounts for differences in human character or ability and that a particular race is superior to others discrimination or prejudice based on race whites have made movies that poked fun of blacks only in a more insidious manner take birth of a nation gone with the wind and ghosts of mississippi in which the secretary kept making wisecracks regarding slain civil rights leader medgar everswhites tend to cry racism as much as blacks do yet we are always accused of playing the race card i think that when a movie portrays some truths about people as does it disturbs them even more,comedy
to see this comedy  an unintentional remake of the 1959 movie some like it hot  they must be willing to forgive the fact that no one distinguishes two blond hairs from two black disguises as this is what seeks to exploit the film to get comical situations  sometimes effective and other times dull that and will depend on the taste of eachyou have to ask yourself another question if you can not stand the typical american comedies that try to search the laughter with a succession of scenes no matter how much connection they have this is not your movieon the other hand if you want to disconnect with a movie that does not require thinking and that simply entertains  this can be a good option it is not the best personally i like the first scary movie of the wayans bros for example but there are others that are much worse little man to put another example of the same creators,comedy
i think that the biggest issue with this movie and the comments ive read is that this is a comedy where blacks are making fun of socialites and the whites are feeling insecure since they are used to poking fun at blacks in movies and not the other way around it seems please people dont be hypocrites there are many movies that are very clearly racist and im not just talking about against blacks either but when one movie comes out with black people as the lead in such a movie like this there is an uproar get a grip this movie is just silly fun and if you didnt like it then fair enough but please dont go on about racism when there really isnt much to say considering how many movies kill off the black guy first,comedy
the incredibly talented wayans brothers have once again delivered a very funny cross culture comedy while i am guessing nobody goes to a movie called looking for the next gone with the wind but i do think that moviegoers deserve more than this particularly given the high quality names involvedthere is enough funny material in the film to make a 2 part skit on a late night comedy show but truly not enough for a feature length film the dialog was very bad although the overall story had some merit there was a large cast of writers on this film but unfortunately it was an incestuous group that had all written other similar wayans comedies like scary movie and the wayans shows the addition of one or two established writers would have really boosted the quality of the plot and dialoga formula works well for medical products soups aligning the hubble telescope but it tends to produce pretty mediocre films i wish the wayans had trusted one outsider on their writingproducingdirecting team the results could have been very different i think much betterlots of great funny scenes and lines that you can use at parties for months to come please see the film and let me know if what i am saying makes sense as you view the film,comedy
basically the wayans bros nail their performances in particular marlon and i had some laughs from their dynamics throughout the moviehowever the movie and its screenwriting and direction itself is cringeworthy to the brim and filled with cheap ripoffs from excellent buddycop films to relying heavily on sexual jokesa bad film but one of the better bad films for a night of unimaginative and easygoing fun,comedy
political correctness need not applythats what makes a wayens brother movie so funnyif you can easily be offended then go see some sweet predictable love storybut if you want to laugh your ass off for an hour and a half to two hours then check out the wayensthay got the same thing going for them that the television seriesall in the famleyhad going for itno ones safe including the offending partysyesis mindless comedybut mindless comedy at its best in my opinionsit backrelax pop it in your dvd player and enjoyi cant wait for their next projectsimple plot marlon and shawn wayens play two fbi agents who after bungling a case are recruited to escort two rich sisters to the hamptons that might be a target of a kidnapping attemptafter a small car wreak and two small scratches on the sisters faces thay decide cant be caught dead in the hamptons where with all the reporters and photographers and socialite friendsto avoid digging even deeper into a hole with their bossmarlon and shawn use their connections at the fbi to dress like the sisters and go in their place,comedy
i mean seriously guys two black men dressed up as wannabe chicks whoever came up with this idea needs to go back to the board again it was offensivestupidpatheticdisgusting even the script was so bad i was like what the hell were they thinkingalright so what is this piece of garbage aboutwell two fbi menplayed by marlon and damon wayans are master of disguises who have to go undercover asyup im really not kidding herefemale chicks who happen to be socialites like paris hiltonthe make up design for this transformation was so bad i mean god they freaked me out with all prosthetics and all scene after scene was so painful to watch at least mrs doubtfire was 10 times better than his piece of crapso you can probably guess the rest of the story yourselves as its thoroughly predicable throughout but if you want to watch a film thats only for the laughs then watch itif not then id say avoid at all costs,comedy
one of my favourite comedies ever its one of those ones where you can return to when youre feeling a bit down and it will make you happy its just nonstop laughs from beginning to end and if youre looking for a profound or intelligent movie then why would you watch a movie called ive seen many negative reviews on here branding it racist or misogynistic well maybe it is but its definitely not offensive because its so over the top how could you possibly be offended by it personally i dont see the film as racist or misogynistic i feel that its making fun of rich elitist girls who only care about money and their image ie people that deserve to be made fun of the only bit that i didnt find funny was the toilet humour but that only lasts a short time and some will find it funny so if you are not too uptight and want nonstop laughs then get this on dvd,comedy
did not any of them people notice its two dudes dressed as ladies horrible misshapen creatures covered in an inch thick coating of makeup ok people doing blackface is offensive so black people doing whiteface is cool its not racist i guess it wouldnt be offensive if it was funny but dude let me tell you this movie oh this movieits sht total piece of sht way to go wayans brothers hey and to be fair i watched this movie with the sound off like i was listening to music and such and this movie was on so maybe i missed the funny now like if i was watching like run ronnie runyknow an actually funny movie even with the sound off it would still be funny funny is funny whether heard and unseen or seen and unheard funny is funny and this movie aint,comedy
geeze what can i say  its absolutely great humor or firstclass comedy lattrell makes me laugh all the way esp when he said  cash or perhaps salad hahaa and i cant stop laughn that on the dance floor hwahaa great performance terry i think you should be got an oscar for that ive seen thiz movie for seven times                         thanks to the wayans brothers  shawn and marlon are dynamic duo  keep brilliant ,comedy
it was a good movie if you didnt agree you gotta live a little it was meant to be a funny movie if you didnt like it you gotta lay off it by posting rude comments on imdb i mean seriously get a life its just a movie if it were about klan or other racial organizations i would disagree but this is a comedy not making fun of anyone if you cant you gotta get out more because comedy movies are out there for many reasons of which i love for example when im down ill watch a comedy because im sad if there wasnt any comedies what would people do to get a laugh at the comfort of their own home by themselves there is also internet to surf for funny images and jokes but what if you didnt own a computer i guess the television would be the last resort well i hope youve learned something todayaziz the lion d,comedy
i rented this movie because i wanted some mindless entertainment this movie surprised me for being rather hilarious i have to admit some jokes were so clich that it became a bit painful to look at the sister thinking that there cloned and almost making an entire x files theory was just funny to look at the hw you want to talk about motherspart was just annoying and the girl freaking out bout how she looked was also much to long to be any fun  the first scene was in my opinion the worst the two singing spanish guys was crap the ice cream man saved the scene a bitdidnt ate popcorn but i think i would have ate an entire box through the entire movie,comedy
just watched this on dvd and while i wasnt expecting much i was holding out hope that there would be some belly laughs not eventhis movie is beyond stupid it totally insults the intelligence of its audience and i mean all of it even the audience that goes to movies just to talk to the screen or on their cell phones while the movie is playing of course we have to let go of reality to accept that the friends of the girls oh hellanyone for that matter cant see that these chicks arent real but what i found more insulting is that were expected to buy that these guys work for the fbi the wayans brothers may be sort of funny and some may think they are handsome but they aint bright certainly not bright enough to pull off playing fbi agents why not make them cops instead but im giving this too much thoughtwhen your friends look at you and ask when the movie is going to get funny its time to turn it off thank cheeseass i didnt pay real money to see this its obvious who the intended audience is and me and my friends just cant get that low brow,comedy
this movie was terrible thats just about all i can say about it it was so poorly done that i am surprised that any studio would have the nerve to create and distribute this extremely bad movie the jokes were rehashed from every movie of this genre whatever that is please dont waste your money to see this bombkeenan ivory wayans directed this movie and apparently its time for him to begin considering a second career his formulaic humor is wearing a bit thin and certainly is tired i didnt understand what they were trying to do with this movie who was it aimed at i guess the only wayans brother or sister i can watch now with any certainty that it wont be a waste of my money is damon and thats because hes on tv and ps you didnt look like or act like ,comedy
love it i have seen it maybe 6 times or so cud see it again and again,comedy
this is one of those comedy movies that you have to give the benefit of the doubt two black fbi agents impersonate two socialite women  they are obviously completely different from the originals and yet everyone believes them to be brittany and tiffany wilson the plot is impossible and ridiculous but you know what at the end of the day is hilarious this is classic 2000s style humour similar in style to hot chick one of my alltime favourites if youre looking for a nobrainer movie for one of those days when you need a laugh  and youre not offended by black comedy  this is a must see i was meaning to see it earlier and am shocked that i havent,comedy
a film done by the wayans brothers is an example of the kind of the crude immature comedies that are common nowadays but its not a very good example i saw a good chunk of this film a couple years ago and i guess i thought it was soso i finally watched the whole thing very recently and unsurprisingly it didnt quite do it for me some are irked by stupid comedies like this in general but i think they can be really funny however while i cant say i managed to keep a straight face the entire time i smiled a bit i did manage to do so for the most part and it was often too stupid even for mekevin and marcus copeland are two fbi agents who are on a mission to catch drug dealers unfortunately they do not succeed in this mission as they end up attacking an innocent ice cream deliverer instead after this the two agents are in disgrace and are very close to being fired but soon they have another assignment this time they are to protect brittany and tiffany wilson two spoiled heiresses from a kidnapping threat while driving these two heiresses they end up in an accident leaving brittany and tiffany with marks on their faces making them feel that they dont look presentable the wilson sisters will not show up at the society weekend with these marks on their faces so kevin and marcus decide to go instead disguised as the two spoiled heiresses will this mission save their careers as fbi agents or will it ruin themthis wayans brothers comedy is filled with toilet humour a type of humour that some cant stand but also a popular type im sure you can tell by some of my previous reviews that i dont have a problem with toilet humour in general however in some cases i find that it can be too much and is an example of that as you can probably tell by the title the movie is also very politically incorrect with some racist and sexist jokes but the wayans brothers arent the only ones currently in the comedy business to do this and many arent bothered by these types of jokes as long as they dont take them seriously i think ive made it clear that the main problem i have with this movie is that its simply not very funny parts that made me smile include marcus falling asleep while his wife is talking to him and kevin and marcus responding angrily in their normal voices to guys flirting with them after they had just put their disguises on for the first time and were not yet used to it however there are also several scenes that i thought were embarrassing or close to it such as one of the undercover agents in the ladies room having a very loud bowel movement while friends of the wilson sisters are also in the washroom and the facestuffing and farting in the restaurant i understand that the wayans brothers were behind scary movie a spoof movie which i think is quite bad i personally didnt find as bad as that but fairly close i think after watching it i do not intend to ever watch little man another film from the wayans which is apparently worse just like i wouldnt have ever watched the dreadful epic movie a spoof done by jason friedberg and aaron seltzer two others who were behind scary movie if i saw scary movie first and after seeing both of those films i wont be watching any of the sm sequels or date movie is in part satire of paris hilton or both of the hilton sisters i like this concept but sadly the potential that the film may have had wasnt reached,comedy
my take as bad and offensive as many of todays excuse for comedy comedies have always grabbed audiences all over nowadays comedies are amongst the wellsold genres of our time but of course hits on the boxoffice doesnt always mean hits to all i watched this film along with my classmates during a freetime they all seemed to know it and like it i for one thinks its bad news but i manage to give it a chance by watching it i didnt finish it and yet i dont manage to the film is brought to us by the wayans brothers behind the hit scary movie films who seemed to be unafraid that the movie references or probably insults themselves im sure its funny for them to see their comedy a success but to anyone who would like to see any sense may just be walking out the theaters almost as fast as a swarm of locusts passing to a fullwheat fieldbut offensive comedies are not all bad that is if in good taste take austin powers international man of mystery as an example i gave it 4 stars for its planned to be a comedy and keeps its title well by making us laugh on the other hand is not all that funny i mean what is funny about two black guys dressing up as two ala paris hilton heiresses part of the plot what plot so overall i spent watching this movie for what nothing but a chill and a cold while staying inside that classroom with our airconditions turned on to highno thanks ill stick to austin powersrating  out of 5,comedy
im no fan of the wayans clan but this was one of their better efforts that doesnt mean that the movie is that good however as it suffers from all the terrible clichs that you might expect of a crossdressing comedynamely the obligatory men dress as women then learn to appreciate the other sex plot also the man in drag surprises male aggressor with a few punches routine its a tired formula that is repeated every time a movie churns out with this themethat said the movie is mildly amusing in a cringeinducing way both wayans brothers give good solid comedic performances but the film fails to deliver on its promise there are laugh out loud moments to be sure but mostly it keeps you smiling albeit with a rictus grin at timesthere was though something inherently freaky and weird about the duo in drag forget the makeup and prosthetics something about their eyes just looks weird and wrong probably just me thoughall in all nothing special but a lot better than the usual wayans rubbish,comedy
bumbling black cop team kevin and marcus pose as threatened heiresses to protect them the brothers resemblance to the heiresses who had great bodies  shame about their faces at least when they were not grimacing was remarkably good i thought  a testament to modern cosmetics technologythe premise had potential and while there were some funny scenes and sketches the gags seemed a bit overdone look at me im funny the dialogue and overall pace dragged relatively predictable with few interesting surprisescorrect me if im wrong but this seems to be the wayans first effort at big screen comedy if so its not bad for a first effort but hardly brilliant and ultimately forgettable,comedy
was a complete was of my life it looks like they would have worked a little harder to make them believable i couldnt see the humor in the film because i was thinking about how awful the looked the thought that someone would want to kidnap them was beyond beliefit was no surprise that they would goof everything upthey should never be another movie the wayans brother need to stick with being men in their future films this is a film targeted for a young male audience this is definitely a mans movie,comedy
basically a big excuse to mock the paris hilton crowd is pretty dumb but never dull shawn and marlon wayans play fbi agents kevin and marcus copeland who pose as a pair of paris hiltonlike heiresses any goofy thing that you can imagine this movie most likely has iti guess that some scenes were a little unnecessary but i overall liked the movie especially since i have probably the lowest opinion of paris hilton of any person on earth the wayans brothers pull no punches in this movie even if is a litany of idiocy it is truly and undeniably da bomb,comedy
1 i saw this movie yesterday and must say that i loved the movie shawn and marlon are sexy as hell who doesnt like looking at them there were parts that were very funny like the thief chase and the dude singing that song in the car and for someone to say it was racist please every movie now pokes at the difference in cultures and races if it didnt they wouldnt hit home and be funny by the way can someone please tell me whats the name of that song that played when the models walked out onto the runway it was a fast paced dance club song i hear that song everywhere and never know the name or who sings it,comedy
i personally think the the shows on upn suck but this movie is funny s i personally find it offensive that that pile of trash movie known as the girl next door is beating this movie since that movie would be in my bottom 5 of all timewayans are hilariousmy favourite parts have to do with the fact that the wayans actually look nothing like the two girls they are portraying hilariousanyways apparently you have to make this comment 10 lines in order to post it which is dumb but whateverive seen like 15 movies so far this summer and this would be about  7 or 81 mean girls 2 harry potter 3 3 shrek 2 4 fahrenheit 911 5 dodgeball 6 man on fire 7 the day after tomorrow 8 9 troy 10 van helsing 11 the stepford wives 12 around the world in 80 days 13 new york minute 14 garfieldword life,comedy
laughs  in fact loud guffaws  are guaranteed for anyone who watches this comedy a good number of comedies are not funny at all i would barely even smile but this one really made me laugh the whole premise is already quite silly and you wonder why the could ever be mistaken for the women theyre masquerading thats the whole jokethe wayan brothers were certainly hamming it up in this one also some of the situations actually mirror real life but this being a comedy things get exaggerated like how the thin lady became a psycho in the dressing room and how one of the was made to squeeze into clothes that were too smalli would recommend anyone to show this movie to people they know who are deadserious would they at least chuckle i imagine anyone in a bad mood would have their spirits lifted after watching this ribtickling gem,comedy
the trailer was funny but the movie itself was a disaster my wife liked it but i couldnt wait until the end i cant believe it lasted almost 2 hours i always enjoyed wayans brothers but they are good for a quick 10 minute sketch the plot of the movie was fairly straight forward 2 cops go undercover as 2 women in order to prove themselves that they can catch bad people and not screw up in the process i cant really say that it was all that funny first of all you could definitely tell that these were 2 guys dressed as women secondly how come no one could detect that these were not the real sisters can one year of absence make everyone so blind that they cant spot whats real and whats fake the jokes were off on timing and sometimes overdone in essence if you dont mind sitting through mindless film then maybe this one is for you but i would like to recommend better films mrs doubtfire or big mommas house,comedy
spoilers spoilersthe copeland brothers fbi agents botch a undercover drug bust on their own and are ushered into a protection duty over two spoilt rich sisters who maybe targets for kidnapping on the way to the hotel their vehicle has an accident the sisters are slightly cut and the brothers are in possible trouble also the sisters refuse to attend a bash they are expected to be at as a result so the brothers call in a favour and are made up as the sisters so that no one will miss them and all can continue in order to flush out the bad guys involvedthere may not be spoilers but its there as a warning in case i do the film started slow at the start but the humour just kicked off from the moment the copeland agents were turned into the sisters when they entered the hotel right to the end i was busting a gut and thats rare for me when it comes to the current line of cinematic comedies of today there are some myths and black jokes and theyre funnily delivered the funniest part was when a mugger takes a bag from one of the brothers who is disguised at the time and runs people are seeing a blonde young female who wouldnt so much as lift a pencil chasing a mugger with relentless pursuit rolling over vehicles leaping and finally tackling the mugger with a rugby tackle the mugger asks if the chase was necessary just for a bag and the brotherwilson girl says no not just a bagits prada also when the brotherswilson girls are in a vehicle with three other girls and the rap music is played and the word n is said thats all im saying on that one8 and a half out of 10 were it not for the slow start would have been 9,comedy
this movie is pure racism nothing funny on it being a guy if people make there faces back they call them racist and its forbidden but the other way around you all say its alright this is pure racism nothing funny on it at all the biggest racists in the world are not but black hate to say it but im right and you all are some stupid people who think that you hate black people for making this movie banana heads monkeys you are oprah obama you all are piece of banana heads kanya is a retard and his wife with his awful fat ass what a joke and that foggy father sick in his head he needs to be killed and all those other son of a bitches drop dead,comedy
i know it is all to do with acquired taste but i well and truly disliked this film even if it isnt quite the worst movie i have ever seen i dont hate everything by the wayans brothers but they are somewhat hitandmiss the first two scary movies were entertaining if mindless but there is stuff like this which was literally painful to watch i dont know where to begin criticising this filmhow about the shoddy camera work to be honest while i have seen worse looking movies does look tacky how about the lazy direction i wouldnt say keenan ivory wayans is an absolutely terrible director but like his films he is hit and miss and here he is very lazy with the direction how about the predictable story now i know isnt the first film to suffer from a predictable story even good films have stories that are occasionally predictable but here there were scenes and situations that i could smell a mile off and i was never surprisedhow about the lowbrow and unfunny humour once again not the first film to suffer from this the friedberg and seltzer spoof movies are prime examples and freddy got fingered and garbage pail kids movie also had some very unsubtle and i think unfunny humour but is one of those films where i didnt laugh once i dont mind unsubtle humour it isnt my thing but i dont mind it as long as its funny but the thing was it never was funny every single one of the gags were stale and incredibly trite and when it comes to using some of the shtick that worked so wonderfully in the brilliant some like it hot it falls well short on the imagination as for the criticism of racism thats up for debate but there are some lines in the script that make you think wow theyve gone a bit too far havent theyhow about the characters well i disliked them every single one of them also is it it just me or arent the characters clichd and stereotypical again it is not the first film to have stereotyped characters the breakfast club and in some ways from here to eternity did too but those two had great casts that didnt make the stereotyping matter that much so how about the acting it wasnt great at all actually for me it wasnt some of the cast are talented but are given little to nothing to do i was especially disappointed with john heard he is great when he has great material but seeing as it was awful he was stuck in fact the only actor who seemed to be trying was terry crews but even his character didnt have that much likability about himfinally how about the soundtrack i love a good soundtrack but while i have nothing against the style of music used here it was forgettable and felt somewhat overused too any redeeming qualities the makeup was pretty good but thats it so in conclusion lame and unfunny and while i am not going to force you if you like comedyclue my cousin vinny oscar young frankenstein duck soup and shot in the dark are some of my favourites from the genre i suggest you avoid this film 110 bethany cox,comedy
i really dont know why you people dont like this movieok the story might be a little off but the scenes the linesas far as concerns me i laughed through the whole moviemaybe someone doesnt understand the black humor the thing when one sister says that her nose looks like the nose of shrekfunny i havent seen such a good comedy in a long time and the black buffed guy he really knows his lines a good movie i tell ya it is worth the time,comedy
i think that the movie was funny and not at all racism people hated black and black people hated for using them as slaves what is up with everyone saying that this movie was racist i dont think it was i think what was funny is that it was more or less a true story on how little rich girls and how they ohnestly act since they have money they think there better than everyone else that is the truth about the movie so get over the racism if you think it is racism its bc your probably and you dont like the fact your getting picked on and you probably have been doing it about the black people so get over it bc your the one who is racist,comedy
the best comedy movie i had ever seen  they make me laugh the entire time,comedy
love this movie know the lines by heart one of the best movies i know,comedy
the twostars ive given along with the title of this review are probably a headsup as to what i thought of this moviebecause they areis 1 hour and 49 minutes of my life i cant get backthe premiseshawn and marlon wayons play 2 incompetent and disgraced fbi agents who are assigned to bodyguard 2 young blonde socialites with more vanity than intellect probably parodies of paris hilton with a little bit of the olsen twins thrown in when the twins get small scratches on their faces they refuse to go to their big society gettogether treating their very minor injuries as the coming of the apocalypse needing the girls to flush out a kidnapper the two agents decide to don whiteface and masquerade as the two airheads hilarity ensuesnow the disguised black wayan brothers pretending to be two valley girls with more money than brains and somehow succeeding in fooling peopleclearly the average iq in this film is a lot lower than in the real world not only do they barely resemble the twins but their disguises fall into uncanny valley once in a whilein addition i noticed a resemblance to some like it hottwo wacky characters dress up as women one of whom then adopts another disguise to woo a lady he fancies while another is chased by a man convinced by the disguise the difference is that some like it hot has no racist jokes at latinos and is actually funny im seriousi did not laugh once watching thisthat all said this film has oneand i mean onesaving grace and that is terry crews in all his muscled hammy chasingwhitegirls gloryconclusion see this movie for terry crews and nothing else or just avoid it altogether and miss out on the attempted humour,comedy
does not at all get the credit it deserved this film is badly rated and it does not deserve it at all i have watched so many times and it has not ever failed to make me laugh marlon  shawn wayans do a brilliant job and it really is pure comedy there is so many times in this film i have literally laughed out loud with tears in my eyes so many scenes that are just pure comedy beauty the film really is harmless there is nothing to offensive or anything to sexual i think many ages could watch this film and laugh its so good the way they dress the agents up and make them look so funny there so weirdly almost believable its fantastic my two favourite scenes are definitely when the dog falls out the car and the changing room scene i screamed so funny,comedy
from razzie nominated keenen ivory wayans scary movie 1  2 and with his writingproducerstar brothers also part of scary movie 1  2 comes this crossdressing interracial and almost risky comedy basically disgraced africanamerican fbi agent brothers kevin and marcus copeland played by real brothers shawn and marlon wayans have one more chance to prove themselves by protecting cruise line heiress and bratty socialite sisters brittany maitland ward and tiffany wilson anne dudek  clones of paris and nikki hilton  from possible kidnap this becomes a disaster when after getting scratches and overacting they refuse to go anywhere so rather than face being fired kevin and marcus decide to disguise themselves as the two and doing this get themselves into hilarious girlie and nearly revealing situations after the usual film things looking bad stage and a lot of gross jokes they do prove themselves good agents when they thwart the bad guy warren vandergeld john heard and everyone makes up yawn it always happens also starring jaime king as heather vandergeld frankie faison as section chief elliott gordon scary movies lochlyn munro as agent jake harper busy philipps as karen everybody hates chriss terry crews as latrell spencer brittany daniel as megan vandergeld eddie velez as agent vincent gomez jessica cauffiel as tori and rochelle aytes as denise porter the crossdressing toilet and sexual gags are always funny highlights include the toilet sequence playing with the dildo dinner between marcus disguised and spencer and the break dancing sequence i guess i can see certain reasons the critics give the film one out of five stars but i couldnt help but laugh most of the time the film also has a surprisingly catchy soundtrack featuring songs such as vanessa carltons a thousand miles pinks trouble no doubts its my life maroon 5s this love beyonc feat jayz  crazy in love benny benassi pts the biz  satisfaction and black eyed peas lets get it started it was nominated the razzies for worst picture and the wayans brothers were nominated worst actress worst screen couple and worst screenplay okay,comedy
im not a lover of these comedy films but this one stands out for me not for the main stars but terry crews is brilliant his expressions he could play anything a hard man funny he may not be the main star but he is the film i hope to see this actor in future films to come he is so watchable so i encourage you all to watch this film for his performance if nothing else and the dance competition scene is great makes you smile and even wind back to watch again the 2 lead actor i take are brother trying to make their names they were funny at time cringable at other times and that line when the bitchy sisters are on the beach and one of them comment about the starving in africa saying she sad every time she sees them in a magazine because she will never be as thin has them is not funny,comedy
12 shawn wayans marlon wayans jaime king frankie faison john heard busy philipps brittany daniel  jessica cauffeiel terry crews john heard eddie velez lochlyn munro maitland ward anne dudek rochelle aytes frequently funny highconcept comedy about a pair of black fbi agents forced to pose as a pair of spoiled rich bitch girls think the hilton sisters who are scheduled for a prestigious gig in the hamptons where a possible kidnapping is set to go kudos to greg cannoms slightly creepy looking yet affective makeup and a game crews as a horny wouldbe suitor on the prowl comes across between faceoff and some like it hot but eventually runs out of gas by the films pedestrian ending dir keenan ivory wayans,comedy
its unappealing cheap comedy that doesnt rub two brain cells togetheri wont say its racist however a race being played by another race in a mocking fashion screams of ignorance and bigotry of cinematic and racial history the wayans have a history of just not being funny in their writing or screenplay and this is the embodiment of it,comedy
the movie is funny it does not take itself seriously and that is itnot much more to say really i enjoyed it would never watch it againterry crews was excellent in this movieit is a comedy dont take it too seriouslywatch it with some beers or some friends,comedy
imagine two comedians doing black face of african american women maybe louis ck and jonah hilloh wait theyre not but you get the picturejust more typical double standards,comedy
this movie is definitely offensive disturbing and plain ridiculous at times but if one looks past that it is also pretty damn hilarious,comedy
i didnt find it hilarious but it does have its occasional momentsthe business of hemen being stuck in a position in which they must pose as girls is amusing in itself though not at all fresh in fact  let me think im trying to think of undeniably masculine men who have worn dresses in movies mostly for laughs without thinking too earnestly or too long i get tony curtis jack lemmon burt lancaster arnold scwarzenegger jeff bridges dustin hoffman cary grant and rod steiger this example is a little different because the wayans brothers fbi men are not only made up as girls but as girls make up has done an admirable job toothats as it may be the problem is that the humor inherent in the situation is drained of energy because its overdone the thunderous sound of a man suffering from diarrhea isnt as funny as a discrete squeal instead of a nudge with an elbow you get a kick in the balls its gaudy fast loudbut man the writers have gotten rich down pat something to do with a gathering of the tony people in the hamptons the wayans are assigned as escorts to two of the most outrageously spoiled and narcissistic young blonds imaginable now thats hilarious because its pointed satire and it knows its realistic limitsas a whole the movie is a judgment call i didnt laugh but then im suffering from a severe case of restless legs syndrome and i have this terrific hangnail on my pinky look,comedy
is a decent movieobviously the story is nothing brilliant or differentbut there still is a good performance from the wayans brothersand this is definitelyin my opinionthere best movienone of there movies are inspired and a lot of there jokes can be very tastelessbut i think offers some very funny stuff with none of the sick sceneslike in the scary movie franchisethat isnt funny or even watchabletwo fbi agents try there best to protect two rich twins who are under a plot for kidnappingthe agents disguise as them while leaving the real ones in there hotel rooms,comedy
it was my daughter kate that went to see with her friends earlier on this week here is her opinionthe film was very very funny with wonderful actorsactresses it was one of the funniest films i have seen in ages alright it was a little daft but isnt that what lots of people enjoy everyone likes comedy you cant not like it especially this film overall this film was excellent with lots of funny bits and you just think wow how could anyone think of such a great idea for a film funny was not all the film it had lots of drama with girlfriends and wives and the bit when they go partying and show their enemies up well that is just so amazing,comedy
give me a break everyone this movie was flatout hysterical the jokes while cheap in a sense were wellplayed out and it gives everyone a chance to poke fun at the shallow and materialistic culture of upperclass elitist women the main feature making this film the brilliant piece of material that it is is the sharp contrast between the superficial aspects of the female class and the soulful and downtoearth behaviors of the black males anyone who feels this movie stereotypes genders or races is a deluded moron who needs to reexamine how our society works the only reason that blacks can poke fun at people is because blacks are obviously the only ones adventurous and humorfilled enough to do so its not necessarily about being racist but about ones perspective and eventual satire on anothers race if there were an equal counterpart to the genius of the wayans brothers then im quite sure that a successful parody of the black culture would be at hand yes i am and i found this movie to be worthy of not only another movie ticket purchase but i will be looking for it upon its dvd release as well thank you,comedy
i find it difficult to try and align the plot and slapstick humor of keenen ivory wayans film with laura mulveys ideas about gender and the role of women in film largely because i think any social commentary found in this particular film wasnt on the forefront of the minds who made this film this is a film that is meant to do one thing and like most wayans productions that is to retaliate against conventions and stereotypes by using said conventions and stereotypes the wayans work to make films that exploit the widevariety of clichs used in modern film yet their films  such as this dance flick and the two haunted house films  all abide by the common tropes of the films theyre parodying so their films feel less like acts of rebellion but more like surrender to filmmaking principlesthe film is a brutally unpleasant slog through the ins and outs of buddycop clichs and tired racial and sex humor that relies on the idea that africanamerican males are wellendowed and all females are privileged and simply stumbled their way into wealth the film revolves around kevin and marcus copeland shawn and marlon wayans two disgraced fbi agents who have just flubbed another serious drug bust their deputy frankie faison gives them one last chance at redeeming themselves by making them protect two young ditsy billionaires named brittany and tiffany wilson maitland ward and anne dudek from a rumored kidnapping plotwhen the wilson sisters refuse to leave their hotel room after getting minor cuts on their face both kevin and marcus impersonate the two sisters in whiteface and are plunged into a beauty pageant alongside acquaintances of the sisters both kevin and marcus cant reveal their true identities to brittany and tiffanys competitors nor can marcus tell his wife faune a chambers exactly what he is doing so the two lumber around in drag as they try to navigate the ins and outs of this business while trying to save their jobswould be infuriatingly racist sexist and stereotypical if it wasnt such a narrowminded and stupid film so hellbent on pinpointing every charmless and laughless racial and sexual stereotype out rather than attempting to do anything with it wheres the commentary on the hypersexualization of women in american film where do we exactly identify and take note of how whilst in drag kevin and marcus gawk at other women but hate being gawked at as women by other men wheres the commentary on the perception of race or at least the satirical side of this screenplay its like a potentialridden screenplay was gutted and left for dead because too many uptight suits got their hands on it and robbed it of all creativity but perhaps thats the creative process of shawn and marlon wayans how else do you explain how it took six people to write a film predicated off of jokes about stereotypes and bathroom activity doing my best to connect with mulveys ideas of phallocentrism mulveys argument is the idea that women couldnt truly enjoy or connect with hollywood filmmaking because of the camera lens being a objectively male and b part of a patriarchal structure mulvey views hollywood films as films that further male ideology and principles by giving males the power in their films to which mulvey states the power of the male comes from the penis and the males possession of a penisone idea of mulveys carries throughout its plot is the idea that women exist in films for visual pleasure what mulvey calls tobelookedatness with that women are viewed in a scopophiliac sense which resorts to viewing women as objects rather than individual characters with individualized ideas almost every female character in is an object representative of fetishized beauty with characters lacking any discernible ounce of authenticity so much of the film occurs in a beauty pageant or involves women trying to achieve unrealistic states of beauty by way of tight outfits breast implants and materialistic possessions that the objectification of women in the film runs rampant because there is no way to view these female characters other than by way of their measurements and their love for material thingsfinally returning to the idea i alluded to earlier about male gaze  where the camera lens assumes a de facto masculine perspective  does abide by that idea as well even though most of the characters we meet in the film are females the two lead characters are males disguised as females which leads to the idea that even if you can paint the focus in a different light you cannot escape the idea of male gaze because its a default in the world of cinema is essentially the male gaze playing dressup much like its male characters in the filmis an unforgivably awful film the kind where one wouldnt be so stupid as to take a few days off from comedy upon seeing it and witnessing jokeafterjoke fall prey to conventionality and trainwreck delivery the film is as obnoxious as it is unfunny with characters and stereotypes  particularly the seriously ridiculous and onenote terry crews character  mistaken for any kind of significance in narrative or thematic urgency i guess having shawn marlon and directorcowritercoproducer keenen ivory wayans giving some kind of worth to this material wouldve been too much to ask we couldve seen how racial and sexual prejudice and tendencies are communicated in many varying shades of gray in a film called nonetheless,comedy
a bust gone wrong sees fbi agents kevin and marcus copeland fall out of favour with section chief gordon keen to get back in his good graces the brothers volunteer to babysit the wilson sisters who despite being spoilt annoying brats are also subject to a kidnapping threat a minor car accident sees the sisters refusing to go to the party weekend in the hamptons  which will see the whole fbi operation aborted with their options limited the brothers go with the obvious option of using makeup and prosthetics to pretend to be the sisters and go undercover themselves the cynical may suggest a flaw in this logic but it all works well with the black brothers managing to convince as women in this upperclass world however while fitting in is the main challenge the kidnapping threat is very realthere was a lot of fuss about this film being racist because it is one race making humour out of the clichs of another race i can see why this argument is made but i cannot understand why anyone would take this film seriously enough to even bother getting into that debate because the film has much bigger questions over it the wheres the women at line early in the film made me realise this because it harks back to blazing saddles  a film that could be accused of being racist but yet subverts it in a way that is both clever and funny is neither of these things but to be honest ignoring the race issue it is a norm that the wayans brothers films are full of easy clichs and stereotypes  black whatever the fact that it is the specific subject of this film doesnt make that much difference the stereotype on show is a specific type of woman  spoilt richkids a la paris hilton and the like a group that deserve to be mocked not for their race but for everything else that they do and are ok so is in the title but really this is the target and i was hoping that such easy targets would produce some good laughs  after all every comedian from the basic to the satirical uses hilton gagssadly for the wayans brothers the best they can do with their script is to populate it with the most obvious material that fits with their characters and then fill the rest of the time with toilet humour pratfalls and other basic material very occasionally they do have some cutting gags the girls envying the starving ethiopian children for their thin frame is one but they are very few and very far between otherwise there is nothing of real intelligence here  but that doesnt really matter as long as we are laughing nonstop right well yes that is how it would work if there were any laughs but the simple fact is that if you even half laugh more than four times then you should consider yourself very lucky because mostly the film is a laughfree crater im sure those that like other films of the wayans brothers and there must be some will laugh but for the vast majority it is just too weak and basic to workas director and writer neither shawn nor marlon have anywhere to go for blame other than themselves although i suppose for them this is a success as im sure it made money which is ultimately all that matters for them now their performances are the usual thing of mugging playing up the ebonics and so on shawn even manages to get himself the usual romantic plot with impossibly sexy black girl despite how badly it fits into the plot the material prevents them being funny but to be honest they themselves are so basic that i doubt they could do more with anything better it doesnt help them that the makeup is poor  this is not norbit where at least the prosthetics are impressive no girls makeup is basic masks that offer little realism or expression to those underneath  they may as well have done it in face the rest of the cast do at least have the benefit of not being in rubbish makeup but they still have nothing to work with the various girls king daniel and others all paris it up the best they can and do soso although i doubt that since house dudek puts this high on her cv likewise faison  who is painful to watch for those that are fans of the wire to be honest the only ones that come away with any dignity are crews and aytes crews deserves credit because he does really make his parts funny and he was the oasis of comedy in this desert aytes likewise deserves praise for managing to have sweet chemistry with wayans and making the romantic part of the film work much better than the rubbish material handed to her deserves it helps that she is stunning with it conversely chambers who also looks just has to deliver a basic jerry springer ethnic clich and is painfulis of course no earthly good at all however those accusing it of being racist are taking the debate further than it needs to of more immediate concern to those watching will not be the racial political issue but rather the fact that it has little in the way of entertainment value it is crude and basic at best with even the easy targets roundly missed the cast are poor with really only the exception of crews the makeup cheap and laughs almost totally absent from the proceedings a roundly poor film whose crime is not racism but rather the facts that it a has shockingly low targets and b still manages to miss most of them,comedy
this movie was funnier than i expected and i have to hand it to the wayans brothers who else could pull off such accurately extreme cultural stereotypes they have as much insight to the hood remember dont be a menace to south central as they do the exclusive hamptons polo club set yes girls like the wilson sisters really existstill terry crews as latrell spencer was by far the funniest character i hope this movie singles him out as a major playerhis scenes in the disco and singing in the car alone were worth the price of admission although the flatulence and bathroom humor got old and seemed misplaced it was still an entertaining film and if you engage suspension of disbelief at times the wayans look nothing like the wilsonsyou might like it,comedy
seriously what did people expect when they went to see this film did they not read the plot summary i mean its the story of 2 undercover fbi agents doing the mrs doubtfire routine to become 2 who might get kidnappedi mean really that is the entire plot  theres not a lot in the way of subplots here  its what i call a dumb comedy like dodgeball  a smart person doesnt go into the theatre for this type of movie expecting a great script great plot and a well directed movieso if thats what you are looking for for goodness sake stay away from this filmi really enjoyed this movie  i was having a crummy day i had a terrible cold and i wanted to take my mind off everything and this movie achieved that yes its a silly plot line but its meant to be  the wayans brothers dressing up as 2 was just funny in itself without needing any plot and there are some genuine laugh out loud moments toogo and see this movie if you enjoyed movies like dodgeball old school and movies in that genre dont go see this if youre expecting realism  you should be going to a shrink instead if you really expected anything more than a late autumn fluff comedyi gave this movie a solid 6 because it was exactly what it said it was and nothing more,comedy
the wayans brothers is surprising not for it being completely funny but for the fact that it is not at all mean spirited in fact it has compassion for the object of its satire ive read some reviews that are stands for politically correctness to the point of nausea is a comedy nothing more and it makes you laugh regardless with the exception of a couple flat spots is totally funny it is not perhaps as clever a satire as undercover brother but its target is different in one sense is not doing anything that has been done before in tootsie where the main characters become better men for having to pass themselves off as women this thematic revisit by director keenan ivory wayans is worth the trip fortunately in spite of the numerous screenwriters in addition to stars shawn and marlon wayans and keenan ivory wayans there are three other collaborators is more hit than miss in fact the funniest scenes are not in the movie trailer because they could not shawn and marlon wayans play fbi agents kevin copeland and marcus copeland their careers are in jeopardy and they have a shot at redemption by protecting the billionaire wilson sisters brittany maitland ward and tiffany anne dudek from a kidnapping threat the sisters are a parody of paris and nicky hilton the wilson sisters are headed to the hamptons to compete for the fashion cover of the hampton magazine however following a poodle induced suv accident the wilson sisters are left traumatized with superfluous scratches that cant possibly be covered by makeup sensing the end of their fbi careers kevin and marcus call upon makeup experts at the bureau to transform them into bittany and tiffany now this is a weird experience because the actual makeup is just close enough to human that it is creepy however as shawn and marlon begin to inhabit the characters that experience disappears at least for me it worked they were britt and tiff the visual effect is outrageous both shawn and marlon wayans are goodlooking athletic guys who stand about 62 so seeing them in heels as with big hands and broad shoulders is hilarious so they travel to the hamptons and encounter their evil rivals heather and megan vandergeld jaime king and the very hot brittany daniel kevin and marcus also reunite with the wilson sisters crew lisa jennifer carpenter karen busy phillips and tori jessica tori marcus becomes the object of lust by pro basketball player latrell spencer very funny terry crews this is where really soars lisa karen and tori could have really been vapid caricatures well they do have vapid existences but keenan ivory wayans makes you care about their hopes and dreams which are not even close to our own now that is an amazing accomplishment there is a very funny dressing room scene involving the gorgeous lisa with kevin shawn wayans which illustrates that being fat is in the story of the woman wearing the couture the need to look beautiful is all consuming there is a great scene where marcus marlon wayans braids karen corn rows at their slumber party in the unexpectedly touching scene marcus coaches karen to respect herself and not make herself a booty call the girls bonding with the impostor and amazingly cool wilson sisters is a nice touch this compassion well suits the story because the whole kidnapping plot is the least interesting aspect of the movie this should not be any surprise instead of complex plotting there is the wackiness of the old school dance showdown with the vandergeld sisters or the wilson sisters laying the smack down on unsuspecting dudes shawn and marlon wayans are a good comedic team along with brother keenan ivory they get the importance of light hearted fun which allows them to venture beyond any taste boundaries shawn is more the leading man and straight man he is very charming and funny marlon is out right funny he also has an innocence and warmth does not provide any amazing epiphany about cultural or sexual diversity however it will make you laugh and laugh a lot that too is a noble intention,comedy
kevin shawn wayans and marcus copeland marlon wayans are brothers and fbi agents who keep screwing up to get back to the good graces they get the job to babysit wealthy socialites brittany and tiffany wilson there is intel that they are the targets of a kidnapping gang when the boys cause some scratches on the girls faces they refuse to go the big social event so the guys get girl makeovers to take over their identitiesthe guys are annoying even before they get the girl makeovers the girls are all stereotypical superficial girls its hard to laugh at the face when nobody sees the ridiculous makeup and talk about ugly and their voices are annoying as heck not to mention that nobody notices the huge makeovers they could maybe get away with playing two unknown random girls but how could friends buy into the makeup this is way too stupid some parts of the movie actually show signs of comedic life like when jennifer carpenter goes nuclear over her body image however there is an overall sense of ugliness that permeates this movie,comedy
my beautiful whiteprincess daughters and i rented this movie and we had so much fun we laughed so hard at some of the scenes we enjoy the wayans brothers humor and appreciate how they are equal opportunity comedians every group gets poked fun at they have an unflinching view of the ideosyncracies of both the race and their own it is refreshing when someone can see themselves for what they are and can laugh at themselves it seems that people in general take themselves far too seriously and take offense so easily i remember when the wayans were doing the show in living color more than a few of their own brethren were offended by their humorous portrayal of the foibles of their own community we should all grow to level of maturity that allows us accept that we arent perfect and that some of the things we do are indeed fodder for humor the wayans have done more to advance the growth and prosperity of their culture than anyone can understand at this time but someday people will look back and see anyway deeper philosophy aside it was a hilarious movie and that terry crews is too cool have a good day,comedy
i was dragged to see this movie ive only watched the trailer once and thought if it as another wayans brothers production i was in a bad mood when i was going in having to pay for this movie but came out forgetting my frustrations this movie was funny for a wayans production and it delivered what it promised a cheesy and corny comedy complete with a senseless plot it was full house when i went to watch it and everyone was cracking up i guess you cannot expect the wayans to produce a five star movie so give them a break loosen up and just laugh at the funny parts in the movie but its better to wait for it to come out at blockbusteri cannot believe that the brothers actually dressed up as women for laughs there were a lot of bad camera angles and made the film hard to watch most of the acting from the supporting class was delivered blankly without much thought i can see why some people get offended by this movie but to a certain extent many of the jokes made were kind of funny the worst thing in this whole movie is the plot it made no sense whatsoever and fell apart at the endyou can say this movie was bad and that made it funny so dont be too critical just enjoy it for what it is props latrell for delivering the funniest performance in this whole movie,comedy
bloody stupid rehash of some like it hot which is actually funnytotally crp im not gonna waste any more space on this filmnot funny,comedy
the only reason i saw this movie was because it was noteworthy when featured on ebert and roeper roeper said it was his pick for worst movie of the year and ebert wrote a funny review of it the stupid plot is that the wayans brothers play these secret agents who dress up as these two annoying women to protect them from being kidnapped maybe the worst part is the fact that the makeup effects are so hideous it was just unsettling watching these ugly crossdressers on screen so much mrs doubtfire showed that crossdressing with latex masks can be funnyanother thing i hate is how annoying everyone is there are these three women characters who constantly complain about how fat they are they do nothing but try on clothes and are bad stereotypes of what men think women are oh and we also get fart jokes the real women themselves are idiotic and annoying theyre so vain and once again horrible stereotypes theres this one really distasteful scene where the real women are mistaken for the agents while not shown on screen obviously they get their private parts exposed this is just distasteful and i feel sorry for the people involved in this they notice that the imposters are taller yet when they appear within a few minutes of each other they dont notice that they suddenly grow and shrink no one would pay 50000 for a date with a woman as hideous as this everything about this film is stupid annoying and offensive ,comedy
remove yourself from the realm of sanityenough said,comedy
honestly i never usually write reviews but for this movie i had to it is a great movie full of comedy laughter entertainment crime drama i did have high hopes for this movie and i was even more impressed when i watched it this movie is one of my favourites i really wished they made a secondthird one i would rush to the cinemas to watch it i highly recommend this movie to watch,comedy
excellent movie i watched it and now its my favorite movie everi cant stop thinking about it it deserves 1010 score not 510it is so refreshing and entertaining and i usually get bored when im watching a movie but this movie made me wanna watch it againwatch a trailer and see that this movie has some pure comedy and it is not racistic as some people wrotei watched anchorman the legend of ron burgundy with will ferrell and i kept thinking when will the funny part come and all i could say is ha nothing more but this movie kept me laughing all the way throughits not corny like some movies and terry crews is the best in itdefinitely a great movie in fact priceless,comedy
dont get me wrong the wayans brothers make crap their movies have everything you can find funny but told in a way so offensive it should be against the lawis most certainly no masterpiece its not high class comedy it barely counts as an actual piece of cinema but considering the other trash the wayans have produced this is most certainly their best movieon one thing its tolerable you can actually sit through this whole thing without feeling nauseatedthe script is average but its smart enough in a way to know its in over its head when addressing fbi situations and the emotional story does actually clicksome of the gags are really funny seriously i laughed at some parts smiled on several and didnt twitch in agony in any scenenaturally in movies like these technical aspects such as lighting cinematography the score and even the acting are taken for granted but it does excel on most of them interestingly in the dramatic scenes you can tell marlon is the superior actor compared to his brother shawn delivers the lines so unconvincingly flat that its funny i dont know if its because he was on requiem or not but marlon simply is a better actorthe reason the movie is not mindnumbingly offensive may be because its more geared toward girls and has more of that chick flick orientation weak but enough for your girlfriend to sit through it its similar to the success that 50 first dates and the hot chick has had appealing to both guys the main target and girlsits a dumb movie its unrealistic which is the funniest part of it it may be a waste of talent for some of the cast and crew involved but its the best film keenen wayans has ever directed and its not awful,comedy
wowthis movie is really funnyespecially for the first time ive seen itnow i watched it too many times so its not that funny anymore but it still has a lot of good laughsi usually watch the same movies a lot of times if i like themwelli liked this one and thats why i watched it for like thirty timesif i havent watched it that many timesid give it ten or at least nine for a comedyi usually like wayans brothersi think theyre giving their best to make good comedies and i think that theyre not commercialized as almost every other directorthey are faithfully doing what they like to dothese kind of comedieseven though they dont pass very well at audiencei think this movie is underratedjust as the little man i recommend both of themand i promise youyou will like them both as long as you take them for what they are and nothing more,comedy
ill admit that when i first saw i had mixed feelings about it at first i thought it was sporadically funny but at second look its pretty funny and is the last of the funny wayans brothers we knew for the record not everybody in america is easily offended by movies like and borat im pretty sure there are people across the globe that are offended by these movies so to place being overlysensitive to americans only is being unreasonable were not all uptight even though there are a lot of uptight people among us i for one can enjoy movies like borat and team america because i can see them for what they are silly comedies made for fun and in hopes of getting us to enjoy them two disgraced fbi agents go way undercover in an effort to protect hotel heiresses the wilson sisters from a kidnapping plot these two also go through a lot of hijinks involving keeping up the charade as well as dealing with nosy girlfriends as well as the real heiresses archenemiesfunny scene1 the beginning where marcus was in the shop trying to pass himself as as hispanic was pretty funny especially when he broke singing guantanamerafunny scene2 the scene where marcus is in the car with latrell and he breaks out into song had me laughing till i was breathlessfunny scene3 the date scene with marcus and latrell is the funniest part of the movie hands down have you ever met a guy so oblivious and desperate that his desperation matches wandas desperation off of in living color i mean i had to hold back the laughter just to watch the rest of the scene funny scene4 the department store scene is not too far behind when you talk about the funniest scenes in the movie there were some pretty clever and not subtle jabs at the insecurities women have about their weight sure it was overthetop but remember this is a comedyfunny scene5 the danceoff scene in the club was hilarious watching those girls shake their flat rear ends then to watch them getting disgraced by duo on the dance floor was too funny for wordsfunny scene6 kevin gets attacked by a rottweiler hes not my dog hes family lol in conclusion if you can handle this type of comedy then go for it if not dont waste your time to me is laugh out loud romp and is the last of the funny wayans brothers movies you think im kidding check out little man and marci x and see if im wrong then,comedy
this is a very enjoyable movie funniest movie that the brothers have made funnier then scary movie 1  2 little man and any other movie that they have done i only recommend this for people between the ages of 1225its the great and simple humor that makes this good unlike little man that was too big and too silly although this story line has been used many times this movie still felt fresh and new terry crews stole the show he had me trying not to fall to the ground laughingi would be happy to see a 2 but it has to have a good script this is a very hilarious movie and is underrated upon the older group this is a must own for anyone who likes a great comedy810,comedy

after an unsuccessful mission fbi agents kevin copeland and marcus copeland fall in disgrace in the agency they decide to swap their bad position with his superior section chief elliott gordon working undercover in an abduction case disguised in the two spoiled daughters of a tycoon brittany and tiffany wilson getting in hilarious situationsdo you remember the oscars in 2005 or 2004 i forgot a person was asking people on the streets what their best movie of 2004 was and you know for comedic effect most of them chose well how could i blame them i love the movie as much as they did well do you think critics will like this movie no they poke fun calling it ludicrous or things along the same lines of thataverage movie goers will most likely like this film well some will hate them too from a person who loves slapstick comedy and toilet humor i laughed a lot in this movie and i had a great time of course the plot is ludicrous of course people dont act this dumb in real life but its a movie to play comedic scenes throughoutthe acting by both shawn wayans and marlon wayans are really good with their comedic performances i would love to give props to them because they would act like women and i find that hard to do i also liked the acting by terry crews brittany daniel and jennifer carpenterthis movie is hilarious with the comedic situations the two main characters get into i also like it that it gets serious when it needs to beif you are a person who doesnt give a crap about the ludicrous plot youll like it i find it stupid people hate this movie for that reason since its meant for big laughs its a really entertaining comedy and is a great collection to the wayans brothers collection,comedy
i couldnt believe just how much i laughed i laughed so much that a little bit of wee kept coming out in each scene in almost ever scene of the movie there was a funny part the ideas they came up with in this movie were just so funny my tummy hurt so much i advise you eat as little as possible while watching this movie as itll make you laugh so much that it hurts the black guy who falls in love with one of the is just too funny i believe critics really criticised this movie bad for no real reason they just dont have the kind of humour that is needed to watch a movie like this the only people who wouldnt find this movie funny are grumpy people and old people,comedy
i dont know why this movie has such a low rating on this site this is my favorite movie i watched it twice yesterday i could not stop laughing i never get tired of it everyone i know who watched this movie enjoyed it the plot may not be entirely original but the director and the cast just take it to a whole new level i also like it because it keeps you guessingyou think somethings going to happen but something else happens basically if you havent watched this movie yet watch it you will be so glad that you did its really fun to watch and after youve watched it come to this site and give it a 10 because thats what it deserves,comedy
its my favorite movieid like to tell you whyactuallythere are three reasonsfirst of allits a really funny moviei have a dvd of this moviethere is no japanese subtitles because its us made i hardly understand englishso i dont understand the content of this movie so muchbuti laugh a lot while watching this moviethis movie can make us laugh only by the imageits a really good movie for those who are depressedyou cant but laugh even when you are so sadsecondlyi can get a lot of information about american girls life from this moviehow they fall in lovehow they go shoppingthirdlythis movie tells about unique characteristics of and black americansthey are so interestingthis is a really nice movie for everyonei can recommend this movie to anyone who loves comedies,comedy
two black undercover fbi agents dress in face or more like rubber face to impersonate a couple of stereotypical dumb blondes the first confusing question i must ask and get out of the way is the same one that many others are asking what would the repercussions have been if the scenario here was reversed today and we had two men dressing up and acting as black chicks why it feels like im taking a risk just writing these words my wife picked this one for a rental and i decided to shrug and give it a chance even though i was against it on a double standard principal well it turned out not to be a total disaster and the wayans brothers were funny off and on and often had me believing they were ditzy rich bimbos who are in a class all by themselves anyhow and whom i guess i dont mind seeing parodied after all is said and done  out of ,comedy
a lot of people find the plot line to ridiculous to believe but hey guys its a comedy in mozarts cosi fan tutte two women dont even recognize their own husbands in disguise silly plots are as old as comedy itself and you shouldnt let them spoil the fun they are an important part of the funanyone who proclaims this is one of the worst makeup jobs ever must be completely blind the makeup was for me one of the main reasons tot see the movie i was very curious how it would look 2 black guys as 2 blonds and i was not at all disappointed of course the result looks a bit strange and it is not very realistic to believe anyone in real life would go for it but yet the girls look amazing i think the makeup team did a very fine stateoftheart joband about racism i think making fun of the differences between races and here also between cultures whilst not sparing the own kind is one of the best ways to fight racism the same thing for the gay jokes of course those also excel in banality and stereotyping like most jokes in the movie but the tone is friendly and in its way i even think respectful i happen to be gay myself and never felt offended in the least,comedy
i really enjoyed this delightfully hilarious movie it had a great cast which suited their roles immensely my favorite character was their three girlfriends they were extremely wittyoutragously muscle terry clews who plays latrell was like perfect for this role i also enjoyed the way they spoofed the hilton girls and the run dmc dancing competition scene was probably my favorite as well as the shopping part with the girls trying to find outfitsthe way which everything fits into place t the end was great it worked beautifully overall i rate this movie a excellent funny classic of the wayans brothers bravo 910,comedy
i was expecting the typical kind of movie like police goes undercover police falls in love during undercover lover doesnt want police agent they end up together although i wasnt wrong on this point i was surprised by this movie because it isnt one of those movies that are so predictable that may be funny but end up being boring i laughed until i couldnt take it no more i had so much fun i could watch it over and over again as to the comments about racism i didnt find any racism on the film i loved it what i loved the most are the too main actors aside from being really good comedians they are really handsome  good looking and the coolest part is that they are really brothers in real life d i really recommend this film if you want to have lots of fun,comedy
i saw and by the end of the show i had a stitch its all very funny portraying how men cant get along with women with pants being too tight hating shopping and chasing a robber all the way just for a handbag women dont have pants being too tight as they are always trying to be slim they love shopping and they dont chase a robber all the way because its either that they dont have any energy or they are wearing high heals all that made me laugh and laugh and ahem another funny part was when they were arguing with the vandergeld sisters the way they disgraced them saying that their mother was stupid in whatever they said made me laugh the loudesti give it an 810,comedy
omg shes gonna have a bf whats a bf bitch fit ahhhhhh i think me and my friends will be quoting this film for a very long time im not sure why this film has created such a great deal of controversy when really you shouldve known what you were getting yourself into before you watched it let me just stand up and say that i am and was not offended by it in the slightest in fact i found it hilariously funny not really making fun of me but mostly of women in general and upper class celeb americans a subject which never ceases to entertain mei didnt think that the plot was weak at all as in most comedies the plot is not really that important gaining a few cheap laughs is much more important the toilet humour wasnt funny it must be admitted but the concept of two black dudes dressing up as was hilarious tiffany and brittany i love you both,comedy
ive seen this movie about half a dozen times now and there are still parts of it that crack me up again and again and againits by no means oscar potential and if u rent the dvd even thinking that it cud u gotta be outta ur mindjust think of the scary movie series and remember that the wayans are starrin in it so the movie will be funny but might not be any good same thing here so just forget the storyline sit down on ur lazboy get ur popcorn and prepare to laugh a bit fo an hour and a halfnote if ur above 25 or if u think that u have a mature taste in movies dont bother watchin it,comedy
i had heard how bad and stupid this movie was so i had quite low expectations ok so the premise of 2 black men dressing up and passing for 2 women is absolutely ridiculous and farfetched they kind of look like michael meyers from halloween but once you set aside your disbelief youll enjoy the whole movie a lot more i think some people were too unforgiving on this point i expected something horrible but to my pleasant surprise laughed out loud quite a lot terry crews absolutely steals the show as the ivorychasing muscle man he is hilarious some people also thought this movie was racist but they need to lighten up anyone familiar with wb sitcoms the wayans brothers kenan ivory wayans earlier films like im gonna git u sucka and in living color will know about their brand of sociallyderived humor which pokes at our societys hangups about racial issues this movie makes fun of black people a little people people a little but mostly it makes fun of snobby socialites and class differences its quite funny if peoplell stop being so uptight no one is above being made fun of i liked this movie a lot,comedy
 bad flickafter seeing previews for this movie for the first time a few weeks back i had no intention of seeing this movie but did hold some hope that it just might be good well as irony and karma would have it i did see this movie and let me tell you sandra bullock was wrong when she said hope floats because my hopes sunk quicker than jack on the titanicthough shawn and marlon wayans portrayal of mexican shop owners in the movies first few minutes was rather funny especially when they tried on their groucho marx impersonation the rest fell fastin the opening scene they attack the wrong men who are supposed to be drug dealers using ice cream as a code name for crack and only get vanilla ice cream instead of missing the real dealers this describes their choice in movie plot a hit and miss which should have become a hit and runand though the comedy of the movie was supposed to come from the brothers dressing as women and barley being passable with some nose reduction and less facial expressions they could have made it into the womens bathroom unsuspected unlike tootsie or big mammas house these men actually could pass as womena flag shows vibrantly to those of pure sanity when there is an mc hammer joke in the first few minutes and is only proved to be more apparent when it is repeated in the finalethe script is very unoriginal and seemed rushed and lazy the idea is borrowed from so many movies including some like it hot tootsie nuns on the run and is almost pitch perfect to martin lawrences big mommas house with the starting within the first 10 minutes lagging on for a good hour and the only to be wrapped up within a matter of minutesalong with many of the movies in which a man dresses as a woman love hops in for the ride and causes trouble marlon wayanss character marcus must hide from his lovely and annoying wife that he is playing dress up as an obvious one half of a hilton sister spoof it is during this time that a black football player with a taste for women gets caught in the tangles of the womans heart shawn wayans however falls in love with a reporter which i thought would be hell bent on exposing them because of a sneaking suspicion but does notthe two girls look like collagen botox addicts with steroid problems as they over shadow the other girlsmy suggestion if you want to see black men dressed as women go to downtown detroit around the fox theater during twilight hours and youre sure to some,comedy
ok so it wasnt the best film ever made but as a kind of bad boys meets mean girls it succeeded appealing to both young and old in my family but mainly to our own the boyz werent quite so interested the acting by various members of the wayans clan was more than equal to the material but this probably speaks more about the quality of the material plenty of toilet humour here folks when the basic premise should have been enough to generate better laughs for me lenny henrys reluctant mob assassin in true identity is the classic portrayal of a black man impersonating a manat the end of the day it is a comedy we laughed mission accomplished,comedy
i dont normally write comments but after seeing the low imdb voting score i feel i must put in my 2 cents its true i had my doubts about this movie after seeing the commercials this is not an oscar movie this is a not a cinematic masterpiece that said this movie is a burst out laughing check your brains at the door good time one of the funniest movies of the year sure the jokes may be crude and the situations ludicrous but people relax its a movie cant movies just be fun and not send a politically correct message all the time just kick back keep an open mind and laugh till the cows come home,comedy
i have to be a woman and then everybody think i pretty is a quote from marlon wayans he is magnificent in the film and really brought out the feminine side of the character i would love to see this film over and over simply because it was funny emotional deep and had a lot of feminine morals but my favorite part was the dancing which was shown in all the trailers i would rate this film as the best i have ever seen and i thought marlon was beautiful as a woman and it really does make the phrase beauty is skin deep have a new meaning i have to admit apart from a sore stomach and tears in my eyes from laughing i did learn some things from the film and that is the joys of shopping,comedy
this film is hilarious and i dont laugh at much but i thought this film was excellent at the start a thought maybe it would of been a bit crap but it just kept getting better it was amazingly funny an the waynas bros in it were great its a film u need to go to with a big group of mates cause its one of these things u need to share an its not at all racist god people get a grip i would totally recommend it to anyone as its just a great laugh the actors were all up to standard and it was just one of these films where u know that the one liners could work it real life i actually now love the waynas brothers they are class god go see it,comedy
such a bad rating 55 only i give it a 10 because it made my laugh so much it is really great and funny good for relaxing i recommend it to everyone who likes comedy movies these brothers are amazing ive watched it so many times and it never gets boring and ive learned so many lines by heart enjoy the movie,comedy
despite the rating i gave i dont hate this movieas many other people have already said this movie is not nor is it attempting to be anything close to groundbreaking or thoughtprovoking its just trying to be funnynow because this movie has only one purpose there is going to be a split crowd youll get people saying that it is either the funniest thing ever or too stupid to sit through the whole movie is centered around one joke the joke is that two tough black guys are acting like spoiled girls again some people love that and others like me dont a movie similar to this that i love is one called the stupids which is about a family that gets itself caught in the middle of a government conspiracy its not a gripping story the message is nonexistent and the only thing that the stupids is trying to do is make people laugh the joke in that movie was that the family was so stupid that they solved every problem the wrong way which i think is absolutely hilarious its so absurd that it almost generates a forced laughter with movies that live or die on a funny premise it all comes down to the viewers reaction to that initial joke this is the area of film where most guilty pleasures spawn from now i admit that the stupids is a bad movie but i can that over and over because i like the joke that it presents i dont like the premise of but not because its a bad premise its just not to my taste if you liked daddy day care are we there yet norbit or anything where a black comedian takes advantage of situational humor youll probably enjoy the comedy in ,comedy
when i heard of this film i thought it was nothing but a low life racist filmthat would be what anyone would be thinking if they came across this film and it was definitely not worth watching until i read the sub heading protecting the two disco divas i then calmed down and eventually i watched this movie and oh my god it was hilarious and as we know extremely absurd bit by bit the film made fun of everyone blacks whitesmexicans guys and girls living in a generalization believing girls are made of sugar spice and everything nice and boys are made of slugs snails and puppy dog tailsoverall as we know the film isnt as bad as we think it is but really the title should be changed into something better because it breaks the whole vibe,comedy
when i first saw the trailer for i thought ok here we go another movie of all toilet humor but surprisingly enough it was very funny i really enjoyed to plot line the wayans are amazingly talented and really tap into what young people want to see on the big screen i laughed so hard and yes there is a lot of toilet humor literally when you see it youll know what i mean but with the talent of keenan marlon and shaun you have to give it to these brothersterry crews as you can read from the other comments was really good he was so funny playing a black man who wants to only date woman but one of the best parts in the movie is a canadian born actor named kevin blatch who plays the infamous aubrey allure aubrey allure is having a big fashion show in the hamptons and the young hip crowd a whos who are all there to be seen aubrey is over to top funny great chemistry with actresss like brittany daniel and jamie king this guys hysterical and would love to know what hes like in real lifeive seen other pieces of his work and he seems like a really well rounded actor check him out in dudley dorite third man out  episodes of dead zone  battlestar,comedy
well before i saw this movie i had to say that i had my doubts however after seeing this i can now say that i was completely wrongthis movie is hilarious the jokes were fantastic and it had a great storyline the characters were brilliant and the wayne brothers were fantastic as usual the movie constantly had me rolling around laughingthe whole concept of black men pretending to be women was brilliant and was done very well ive watched this movie a dozen times and i still dont find it boring i would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good laugh a must see comedy,comedy
ive read several reviews talking about how racist this movie is and how bad it isnot one of the worlds great examples of cinema i agree but this is after all a comedynot to to mistaken or reviewed as if it is great shakespearean theaterthe only reason people dont think marlon and shawn look anything like the women they are impersonating is because the viewer knows its themfurthermore they couldnt make them look exactly like the girls because that would ruin the whose comedic effect of the movietheres supposed to be a little difference in the wayans brothers and those girlsplot could have used some more work and its still sometimes after even multiple times watching it unlcear as to why the wayans bros have to impersonate womenthe one thing that got on my nerves is marcuss wife and her nosy friendi think every husband knows his wife has a friend or relative like thatif my wife ever accused me of cheating on her for getting home two minutes late itd be on then every time gina thought he was cheating her friend who didnt have a man of her own was right there to feed fuel the flames i told youthe part where marcus out of makeup is caught in the room with kevin who is in full drag by his wife and she thinks he had another woman up there why didnt they just reveal themselves and explain they were undercover and i know he couldnt blow his cover but wouldntt it have saved him a lot of heartaches with his wife in this one scene but really people lighten upthese movies are never meant to be taken as seriously as some of you do,comedy
right from the start i knew this film would be appalling but therefore hilarious rules to conduct a successful drug deal arrest from the wayan brothers1 do the deal in the front of your shop counter 2 dont check if youve actually been given drugs before you try to arrest the perps 3 dont have back up available 4 when things go wrong start shooting haphazardly in the direction of the shop window with no thought of hitting passers byeven though the joke at the start of the film was that the wayan fbi brothers had got the wrong perp who were delivering drugs posing as ice cream sellers the legitimate ice cream sellers didnt think anything of taking payment of thousands of dollars in cash in a suitcase for one ice cream delivery thats some good ice cream and if they were going rogue in this first case where did the wayans get that cash from in the first placethis all happens in the first 5 minutes and it literally doesnt get anymore plausible i can suspend disbelief to enjoy a concept as much as the next film fan but this stretches things the two girls the wayans are posing as have friends that think nothing of the broad shoulders big arms and general behaviour of these girlsthis is a stupid film with plot holes tired concepts lazy jokes and underdeveloped comic set pieces one for silly girls who want a giggle and some wishy washy men dont understand us philosophy this is a little racist as it promotes stereotypes of black and people like the fresh prince of bell air did,comedy
at some point in the last ten years comedy took a severe turn for the worstfarts burps crude sexual humour became an absolute necessity in comedies whether it be a family comedy or raunchy teen adult comedies they all seem to must have one or several of those things to be humorous one the fathers on this turn in comedy would be the wayans brothers with their scary movie series which will never seem to end and this filmis a movie about two less than great cops played by shawn and marlon wayans they are apparently pros at going undercover in disguises and acting so stupid that no criminal could ever fall for their guise but they do after their first attempt at undercover goes bust so to speak they are brought on to protect a pair of young heiresses ala the hilton sisters or as they are known the wilson sisters rather than trying to protect them the partners leave them in a hotel room and become them head to toe with the best of technology i must say the outfits are quite impressive although improbable you cant get much closer to being someone else obviously hilarity ensues as two black tough macho men have to become snivelling stuck up rich little girls that is the redeeming quality to his film is that marlon and shawn do a great job acting like the girls they make it almost believable and hilarious for the audience who knows their true identities the story moves along at a great pace without getting too stale although very predictable the comedy at times can be very touchy when it comes to race for those of you who are over sensitive about that sort of thing and a lot of crude sexual jokes aimed at women that kind of makes it seem like women are being pointed as dumb slutty and basically useless the highlight of the movie is the dance competition between the vandergelds and the wilson sisters wayans brothers overall if you are not easily offended by being made fun of then its worth checking out for a night of nonthought provoking film watching its fun despite its stupidity that can be funny 610,comedy
there have been much much worse comedies out there  i tend to be very picky when it comes to comedies but this one against my initial expectations worked for me  however any viewer of this movie must keep in mind that political correctness is the enemy of comedy  how else do you explain the massive success of all in the family  why are some movies and tv shows praised for being politically incorrect while others are bashed when the humor is meanspirited i understand but is not one of those cases  in the days of minstrelsy whites had a grudge against the black people and thats what distinguishes minstrels in blackface from the wayans in whiteface  besides the wayans are equal opportunity employers when it comes to irreverence  they crack on latinos asians and even people of their own race  have you ever watched that little show calledhmmin living color  the show featuring a big chunk of the wayans family thrived on racial humor but it proved to be a big success it also brought in big laughs  the wayans even in the case of the eldest brother keenan arent exactly masters at humor and this movie is no annie hall  til this day they depend on crude sexual references bodily functions or both to get laughs  but you know what  it often works the film opens with a hilarious gag involving an undercover operation at an inner city bodega  shawn and marlon pose as the hispanic owners of that bodega  i repeat political correctness is the enemy of comedy  the gag contains every hispanic stereotype you can think of but i was cracking up as several other people have pointed out its hard to find it credible that anyone would believe that shawn and marlon are really girls  that is true but the low credibility factor didnt ruin the film in my opinion its meant to be a silly slapstick farce and not everything in a farce is meant to be realistic  as i said were not watching annie hall  some films are meant to be realistic and others are meant to stretch the boundaries of reality  and the movie definitely stretches those boundaries but it doesnt abandon themterry crews who i previously saw in friday after next in a much more thankless role steals the show as a rich black man who lusts after women and ends up lusting after one of the wilson sisters who is really marlon in drag  seeing him a huge muscular black man singing a thousand miles is worth the full price of admission  i honestly didnt see that joke coming and the gag serves as proof that the wayans arent talentless hacks  i mean he not only ends up singing it but he sings the whole song thats the kind of payoff you would only get in a farrelly brothers movie so kudos to the wayans and the hilarious terry crews for that scene undoubtedly there is a share of gags that elicit simple groans instead of laughs but the hits outnumber the misses and thats what counts  many of the gags are predictable but funny nonetheless  as long as you dont enter the theater with a pc mindframe and expecting biting social commentary you should enjoy this film  my score  7 out of 10,comedy
i have read some of the comments about this movie  and yes i have seen the movie it totally amazes me how people are just waiting for a reason to bitch about something this movie is a movie and that is all i am sure that the wayan brothers didnt mean it as a racial movie i have read everything from stuff about  b e t  black entertainment television to comments about if they can segregate then why can we i dont even know why people are talking about this crap the whites that are giving their comments about the movie need to readup on the history of the us and i mean the real history of the us the us was built on racism and it was done under the cloak of christianity the pilgrams come here to get away from a government that held them captive  and gave them no rights does that sound familiar but getting back to the  just of what im saying here  dont use this movie to express your hatred bigotry or racist opinions it was a comedy the us is the richest country in the world why is it also the dumbest country in the world we have everyone complaining about everyone whites saying that they dont own blacks anything  then why are we here lol blacks didnt ask to come here lol and for the blacks  how can we get respect when we call other blacks the very same name that the whites use to cut us down my last comments are  the movie was funny if you like that kind of humor that airplane scary movies type of stuff and the list goes on and on america is now the melting pot of the world and if you dont like it  then you get the hell out ,comedy
interesting that this movie is sparking such a debate about race relations but uh there are more important things to debate these daysits hard to believe that this movie made almost as much money as f911go see fahrenheit 911 its the most important movie of the yearif you like to debate issues see f 911 and make up your own mindif youve poisoned your mind with useless brain swill like this cleanse yourself with something meaningful,comedy
thank god i saw this on cable  didnt go 2 the theater 2 c this tripe  drivel if i could give this zero stars i would,comedy
what i was doing with my life since 2004this movie is funny like hell,comedy
such a hilarious movie the cast did a phenomenal job as portraying their characters so well i truly enjoyed it love laughter serious moments,comedy
is a broad vulgar farce count the fart and poop jokes within this category it stands out by being peculiar to the point of madnessin the movie two young black males get transformed into two young females for reasons best left unexamined the effects prosthetics makeup etc are impressive however impressive does not mean perfect and here the two protagonists end up looking not like two normal women but like like well what exactly  two deadeyed androids  two patients afflicted by a variety of cruel diseases  two members of a hominid species surviving in the most remote caves of tibet the result in other words is disquieting rather than convincing yet within the movies narrative framework all other characters except those in on the secret accept the two protagonists as and female more all other characters accept them as pretty young things of the spoiled and fashionable variety  indeed some men are so charmed they fall in love  lust with themnow let me see you suspend that disbelief  one two lift one two lift  suspend suspend im still awarding the movie two stars because i think that its main target is fully worth mocking  does a welldeserved hatchet job on the kind of trust fund superbtch who is not only lazy shallow and mean but prides herself on these qualities apart from this one asset  flee you innocents flee and save yourself from this abortion ,comedy
yes the plot is silly but if you get past that the film is really funny and there are some hilarious moments in the film,comedy
its not a masterpiece of a film but it doesnt set out to be cheesy cringey but a good laugh,comedy
this is better than i expectedit looked awful and turns out to be relatively funny although the humor varies between absurdinspired like the club danceoff and justkindadumbandbroad the slapstick fashion show finale but the saving grace is terry crews who is pretty far down the cast list but steals the film as a star athlete who has a taste for meat and doesnt shrink from focusing that attention on our heroinesno matter that theyre actually black men in female drag hes so good i dont know why no one has built an entire comedy movie around himive seen him in lots of supporting roles but no leads i havent seen his tv work though of course hes done a lot its taken me a long time to see this movie but the takeaway is that i should have spent that whole time following terry crews career more closely hes a riot,comedy
was directed by keenen ivory wayans and stars marlon wayans shawn wayans and terry crews after they get dragged into babysitting duty two fbi agentsmarlon wayans and shawn wayans disguise themselves as girls and try to foil a kidnapping before it happensis the type of film you throw on at a party while on the verge of passing out and just leave it on in the background not that that is a knock against the film however its a very enjoyable movie that will get some laughs when your sober but will be much better when youre off your head its funny but it shouldnt be it shouldnt work but it kinda does that is the best way to describe this filmthe story is stupid and really poorly written it was merely a thin thread to link together a series of stupid events the ending was overly happy and the last shot of this movie before the credits will haunt you for the remainder of your livesmarlon and shawn wayans did good jobs as marcus and kevin but shone as the two sisters brittany and tiffany wilson when they become the sisters is definitely were the film picks up and is where both actors could do their best terry crews was my favourite part of the movie and played his part excruciatingly well he was latrell and that is kinda worrying considering the characterno one gives one about how this movie is shot and edited but if youre in the 1 that do its not well done its messily shot and edited together and just looks odd it doesnt feel fluid and is just plain messyon all accounts this movie should not be funny it shouldnt but the committed cast and peculiar director make it work to a certain degree i do recommend you watch this while intoxicated because youll probably enjoy it a lot more but you can watch it soberlike i did and get some entertainment out of it ill rate this movie 6 chocolate men out of 10,comedy
this movie should not be taken to heart its sole purpose is to make you laugh and i can tell you it does that ever so well it take a particular sense of humor to like this movie and if it hits the sweet spot for you youll be loving it this movie should not be taken to heart its sole purpose is to make you laugh and i can tell you it does that ever so well it take a particular sense of humor to like this movie and if it hits the sweet spot for you youll be loving it this movie should not be taken to heart its sole purpose is to make you laugh and i can tell you it does that ever so well it take a particular sense of humor to like this movie and if it hits the sweet spot for you youll be loving it,comedy
this movie is actually not that bad a story starring shawn and marlon wayans as two disgraced fbi agents assigned to go undercover disguised as blonds to protect a the wilson sisters hotel heiresses from a kidnapping plotthis movie is full of crude humor and jokes but they are not overly done which makes this a tolerable movie to enjoy this movie also pokes fun at people of different culture and background harmless enough to appreciate the humor than rather to be offended about it i especially liked terry crews character portraying a nonstereotypical black man who likes teenagepop musicthis movie is probably not meant to be taken seriously as the plot is and overall story are average at best but its really not bad of a fan to enjoy a good laugh fromgrade b,comedy
hello first of all i am not a racist my mother is from great britan and my father from austria ive got nothing against other colored people i my self count a bunch of friends chinese and africans to my friends also the movie is really funny i was wondering what would happen if we would do a opposite role play exchange for this movie i would imagine that some people really could be offended this kind of stereotype is not pleasant for anybody greetz alex,comedy
hmmm well i was like one of the others who commented i thought this movie was just one of those stupid gag me with a spoon movies for teensi was pleasantly surprised this movie is in the top 10 funniest movies iv seen you will laugh from the first scene to the lastthis was the funniest movie i have seen in a long time this movie makes fun of everyone black rich poor dorks cool people no one is safe and the brother who falls for marlon in disguise had me peeing in my pants and theres even bit of commentary about social and racial stereotypesall i can say is man was i surprised,comedy
i have read several comments about this movie from two lines to several paragraphs and people its a comedy it is a movie filled with comedians so i cant understand why you would expect some well thought out plot comedians get paid to stand up and ramble from one subject to the next without any rhyme or reason and we pay to sit and watch them as far as the movie being racist i didnt see it yes they made fun of the 2 sisters but the black characters were made fun of too this movie was made to make you laugh and i laughed i would not suggest this movie for anyone that doesnt like comedy and especially the wayans comedy because everything is fair game,comedy
four words  hi la ri ousim a critic by nature so im here to say this movie was truly funnyi saw this movie with my best friend and we cracked up from the beginning to the very last scene there was a scene with a button that popped off of shawn wayans pants and that is what almost happened to us both while watching this movie we could not stop laughing and nearly busted a gut i cant get that song out of my head shawn made a cute girl and marlon wasnt bad himself i applaud all the wayans for allowing us to witness their unique gift i now have a new profound respect for mr terry crews he made the movie what it wasfunny funny funny on the way into the movie an employee told us it was a great stress reliever and that sums up the movie for me thanks,comedy
you are in need of help if you like this film can tolerate it can accept it or find any piece of it funny this film makes the new ghostbusters seem funny the new star wars tolerable donald trump seem intelligent ok i exaggerate,comedy
anyone who thinks this movie deserves anything lower than 6 has no sense of humour and has major problems with racism in my mind i wasnt bothered by the blackhumour in the movie i am and i think the cast crew have dun a good job and i hope to see more hilarious wayans brothers films in the future plus why have people be probably giving this movie such bad ratings when they probably havent seen the movie that is one problem that gives this film bad reviews i hope imdb get this sorted out and that people should just vote for movies that they have actually seen instead of doing this rules lookin forward to little man,comedy
have an open mind when you sit and watch its a silly yet very funny comedy with many laughs and many funny moments dont go to watch if youre expecting an oscar winner just go to watch if you want to enjoy yourself and an hour and a half of laughter,comedy
okso this movie is one of the best comedies of ever seen it has a ton of humor rewind scenes and a good story people think the movie is trashy but personally i think this movie is gold you cant go wrong with this movie the people who dont like this movie obviously have no sense of humor because i had a laugh attack every five minutes the movie is fun but started off a little boring but it quickly shifts to hilarious ive seen this movie about 5 times and it never gets old i think you guys can handle itprepare to laugh until you die and grab some snacks and a soda and crawl up in bed and watch this movie and for all you haters back off losers go watch a funnier movie,comedy
back when comedies didnt have to be the raunchiest things on earth there was a comedy that was popular when it came out and then got left in the shadows that movie is the movie is about marcus and kevin played by marlin and shawn wayans who have failed to capture their latest bad guy the chief puts them on a highly important mission that if they screw up they get fired they have to pick up to rich women and take them to the hamptons but when they get cuts on their faces they two guys have to pose as the two girlsthis is a movie where if you take it too seriously than you cant enjoy a lot of comedies filled with over the top humor racial stereotypes and fun acting than is for youthat did not sound rightrated pg13 for crude and sexual humor language and some drug contenttheatrical 1hr 49min109min unrated 1hr 55min115min,comedy
its movies like this that make me like the wayans brothers they are inventive bold daring and most of all they are funny this movie was incredibly well done and incredibly funny the wayans brothers arent afraid to go out on a limb and try something new with comedy and i think in this instance it paid off if you look at their track record starting back with one of my favorites im gonna git you sucka dont be a menace scary movie scary movie 2 and not to mention their star producing regular show in living color they have proved that they have a successful formula for comedy hilarious and could only be as funny as it was because of 1 the chemistry between the two brothers marlon  shawn and 2 you had to have black men play women it would not have been funny any other way if it were black men playing black women or men playing women or even black women playing women it just would not have had the same appeal and lure i say chalk this one up as another wayans brothers success,comedy
2004s is not a great film by any means but it is still really funny shawn and marlon wayans played the preppy girls to a tee i thought that was a funny premise too two black guys trying to play two bratty girls that just sounds like it would be difficult but shawn and marlon pulled it off they play two brothers who are fbi agents who are assigned to protect two sisters of a hotel tycoon who are involved in a kidnapping plot the wilson sisters are unable to be seen in public because of a cut on their nose and lip after a car accident so kevin and marcus the wayans brothers are forced to go undercover as the sisters now they have to act look and dress like the sisters and the laughter ensues some of the funniest scenes are when kevin and marcus as the wilson sisters are trying on clothes and being hit on by different men one of the funniest scenes to me was when theyre trying to sing a thousand miles by vanessa carlton theyve never heard the song and dont know the lyrics so theyre just mumbling and saying every other word that was so funny and the scenes where theyre checking out their friends forgetting that theyre dressed as girls love that the humor can be crude at times in this film but i still think its hilarious this is one of the better wayans brothers films that ive seen they were perfect for the premise of this film i cant think of anyone else who could have pulled it off can be crude and offensive at times and it isnt a great film but it will certainly put a smile on your face from laughing thank you for reading my review,comedy
is parity on rich republican teenage to early 20 year old girls the movie plays of the stereo types of both sexes  the economic classabout two police detectives dressing in costume cross dressing teen age girls to protect the women theyre dressed as the makeup job is exquisite the actors shawn  marlon wayans do an excellent job of mimicking womens mannerisms their timing when they slipup  expose their male sides such as their voices is a crack upjennifer carpenter has a great piece in the movie as a psychotic weight paranoid woman with low esteem the two counterparts detectives are a crackup they are always quizzing each other on sexual prowess the one detective manages to get out of responding when his sexual fantasies are questioned they cant tell the real girls from the imposters  proceed to pick their clothes off  molest their appendages in front of the police chief terry crews who plays a professional athlete does a fun job of showing his secret feminine whitesideall in all i think the movie is better than 2 out of 4 star scale it currently shows i think the movie might be a little busy than an average comedy should be there is a lot to the movie  if you dont know what is going on from the beginning you wont get the movie  think it is the stupidest movie ever made i personally like my comedy a little stupid this isnt a movie you can burn a bowl  sit through it requires some attention,comedy
this movie is your typical brainless comedy its the kind of comedy that the wayans brothers are famous for and theres a reason for that its really quite funnythis movie as is customary with this type of comedy even has something to say about relationships both with friends and with significant others im sure that this was always a part of the story but it does give you the sense somehow that it might have been a means of fleshing out the script and characterssure its not cutting edge comedy and the acting isnt great nor is the story but its a wayans brothers project its not going to be a genrebusting offering but the visual jokes are funny and provide a couple of laughoutloud moments as do some of written jokes because shawn and marlon know where the laughs are and go all out to shake every last titter out of you sometimes it doesnt quite work but hey theyve definitely tried with this oneso if youre looking for an intelligent comedy you wont find it here but if you want a couple of hours where you can leave your brain in your coat pocket and just laugh and lets face it why not then go for it,comedy
its not a new joke to put men to play women but it still is quite effective if its not just the only joke in the movie i didnt expect too much from this movie and i wasnt judgemental about it the previous movies had been horror so i wanted to watch something which is not so heavy to watchthis movie gives good laughs from time to time and it has a few scenes where you just cant help laughing they must have had great time in the set and i could see the good spirit and chemistry between the actorsthis movie makes fun of rich people who have everything and it even makes fun of itself if i had to say something negative about the movie then id have to say that its story goes flat towards the end somehow the whole movie is predictable but then again thats alright because its just meant to be a crazy comedyif you want something funny then this is for you its better than the average comedies,comedy
this film has one of the 2 best farting scenes ive watched in the last few years the other being the castle bathroom battle hit scene between the 2 girls at princeton when he has his diarrhea attach after eating all that quiche i laughed until i had tears in my eyes i bought the dvd and have watched it many times the lactose intolerance attack and the leg movements involved were classic the final love ya from the wayan as the other girls fled for their lives was the cherry on top as far as being a racist movie that is so much dribble everyone is so over sensitive these days its just a fun movie in this movie everyone is a victim of comedy black young old dumb nerd rich poor on and on loved it,comedy
i was surprised at the reactions of the first 10 reviewers ok its only a movie people a comedy at that so lighten up terry crews who now plays julius the dad of chris on everybody hates chris stole the show he is a sympathetic character like no one ive seen before he has so many hilarious lines his physical comedy is genius its worth watching just to see him in a speedo the wayans brothers are hysterical as pompous heiresses think paris and nicky hilton and the friends are really funny a dressing room scene where one the girls thinks she is fat is so perfect they really nailed it there is a lot of really gross bathroom humor and some racial stereotypes but overall this movie is light hearted fun,comedy
my wife talked me into watching this movie before i rented a copy i checked the reviews on imdbcom they were mixed some people loved it others hated it i decided to take the plunge and put up with what i expected to be a poor excuse for a comedyfortunately i my expectations were way off baseif you want to see social commentary from this movie then this isnt the film for you there are some jabs but that is not the thrust of the filmi should mention that my mothers funeral service was earlier in the day so i wasnt exactly in a laughing mood however there were 2 or 3 spots in the film where i doubled over in laughter yeah its a dumb premise for a movie but it workswe watched the unrated version there was one scene which i thought was too crude but aside from that i enjoyed the lowbrow humor i can recommend this film for laughs alone,comedy
is not a movie for the masses it doesnt take anything seriously nor does it take it to a realistic level what it does is pokes fun of hiltonesquire mentality cuz thats hotdid i laugh during this movie yes of course i thought each scene was ridiculous any person with common sense and reason knows that in reality this would never happenwhat i did take home with me is a few cheap laughs and some stupid quotes that i say to my friend from time to time a person who watches this film should go in that this is not the greatest movie of all time and has to take the movie for what it is   a parody of a life style that no one will ever believecan this really happen sure probably why not but then again probably notin a realistic setting and a critic review this movie is a 4 out of 10 if one is looking for substance plot character development climax and other things that make a movie a movie in my own mind set this movie is an 8 out of 10 because of pure mindless fun that makes fun of the whole ditsy hiltonesquire affair the only thing missing from this movie was probably the infamous tape,comedy
i saw and to be honest it was a really cute kind of racist movie i thought the end was cute and a lot of the lines were hilarious and they were all people talked about for a while so i decided hey why dont i watch it i watched it two or three times for me to get all of it but i ended up getting it and it was cute i thought the lines were really funny especially when they went all yo mama and when they were trying on clothes i was laughing out loud so much i was so happy that the movie came out and i regret not seeing it in theaters it would have been a lot better thanks for reading krista,comedy
i havent seen too many wayans bros movies but i am glad i saw this one a group of friends and i had won free passes to a preview before it was actually released and we were all uniformly amused the movie is funny and entertaining though it is also silly and often stupid it is chock full of fun gags and mishaps and great jokes and linesthe wayans are consistently funny in this film and the characters around them are equally funny whether they are good guys bad guys or in between the whole movie is funnyi was in stitches through majority of the movie it is certainly not a work of art and the premise has more than been done before but black working class guys into rich snobby hamptons girlscmon it is vintagei think people are way too hung up on the whole race issue and take things too literal when it comes to poking fun at whites blacks rich poor or whatever take it at face value a good er uh family movie with lots of laughs even if you are not a great fan of the wayans it is worth seeing,comedy
is the latest comedy to come from the wayans family with keenen ivory wayans directing and his brothers shawn and marlon starring in it they play two bumbling fbi agents who have to accompany a pair of young society girls to a big bash in the hamptons soon the two black men find themselves posing as women namely the wilson sisters this movie does have a few laughs but most of the time it just seems like everyone is trying to go out of their way to be outrageous the best performance comes from the scenestealing terry crews as latrell spencer a hulking basketball player with the hots for women apart from him is just for those who like lowbrow comedy,comedy
i think that this movie is very good mainly because it makes fun of richspoiled kids that are so popular nowadays the main idea is not to laugh at this people because they are but because they are stupid some blondrich girls hilton sisters would be excellent examplewho only think about shoppingand how to fix themselves by the plastic surgeries are perfect targetand if you think that they faces look unreal you should look at newest video of christina aguilera and notice that she has even more makeup than themand that should be frightening  this film like two parts of scary movie made by wayans brothers is pure fun for everybody apart of driving bmw stupid blokes ,comedy
i generally like the wayan brothers lowbrow gag fests and for a while works pretty well as a hit or miss series of gags id say for the first maybe 40 minutes is a fun takeoff on paris hiltonlike rich girls with some very funny scenesbut while the scary movie movies played their clichd formula for laughs takes its cop buddy movie framework too seriously instead of ridiculing the clichs of these movies it embraces them including touching scenes of girl empowerment and buddy bonding it is as though the wayans are simply too lazy to deconstruct their material and they really should have brought in a decent script doctor to bring some originality to the story since the five or six writers credited were apparently unable to do sothe movie does a good job of turning two black guys into two although it makes no real attempt to make this seem in any way sensible and have some laugh out loud moments but a movie this trite and unoriginal needs to be a laugh riot from beginning to end to work and the successful gags keep coming farther and farther apart still if your a fan of the wayans it might be worth watching for the earlier scenes excluding the opening scene which is shockingly dreadful,comedy
the way that i personally rate a comedy isnt the same as any other genre when i watch a comedyi intend to laugh my tush off that is the only emotion that i want when i decide to watch a comedy that is why i rate this so high because i laughed constantly emotion is the only reason i watch movies i will say that marlon and shawn make pretty hideous girls if you enjoy masterpieces may be you should make another choice at blockbuster but if you are like me and just want a good laugh this is definitely a great choice we watched the unrated version which was a lot tamer than a lot of movies i have seen so be daring and rent the ur version,comedy
i enjoyed this movieit made me laughof course i know it isnt an oscar worthy epic but it was funa good movie to watch on a slow weekend with some chips and dipi like the wayans they are always funnyi think that if the film had better writing it would have been more popular and made some money at the box office i get tired of watching movies with so much killings and end of the world plot linesi also think that keenan ivory wayans should have put his other brother damon in the filmdamon is very funny and i think he would have made it a lot better the dancing was good i liked the scene where the girls were break dancing very funny,comedy
if you want to see a shakespearean masterpiece then dont watch this movie however if you want to see a laugh out loud funny flick without taking any of it seriously then by all means watch it and no theres nothing racist about this movie lighten up the wayans brothers marlon and shawn were hilarious and keenan did an excellent job directing i hope that these guys will make more funny stuff like this movie or their scary movies itll be great if they could make a full length wayans brothers movie based on their tv show from wb bottome line its a movie to grab a popcorn and soda with chill out and laugh your pants off if you are politically correct or uptight then dont watch otherwise enjoy,comedy
 shawn waynes marlon waynesi thought this movie was outstanding marlon waynes is a very good actor so is his brother shawn i think they should have been in a more active movie like an extra good comedy or a drama they have a talent and believe me dressing up like a woman was a big talentthis movie was yes funny it was sugar sugar good but not like umpa lumpa good but it was over all desent i think that this movie was overall good i think that their should be a second 1a this movie was a great i think this is up for a grammy,comedy
this movie isnt meant to compete with titanic its a comedy poking at race and socioeconomic differences chick is a funny movie that actually comes off with a heart its not so much hahaha look at the funny black man pretending to be a girl its you know what its not easy being a girl and this is why its a great way to to kill an afternoon if you think youre going to be disappointed then see a matine but i promise you wont be this is a good little movie and its extremely entertaining the movie starts out first 15 minutes a little slow but picks up speed the rest of the movie more than makes up for a slow start the jealousy of the wife in the movies is irritating and distracting threw most of the movie but circles back around and makes her tolerable but the end as well terry crews as latrell spencer steals every scene that he is in he was magnificent in playing such an over the top character fantastic movie,comedy
writing producing directing and starring in the first two scary movies must have taken a lot out of the wayans brothers is only half as hilarious as their blockbuster horror spoofs moreover the wayans stretch their onedimensional drag comedy to the breaking point and it snaps the jokes dont fly as thick and fast as in the scary movies incredibly the wayans keep grossout humor to a minimum in their amusing combination of big mommas house meets the classic 1959 comedy some like it hot with marilyn monroe of course the main reason to watch is to howl at shawn and marlon as they don womens apparel and struggle to pass themselves off as the title heroines suspending your disbelief to accept this farfetched farce in which two africanamerican dudes dressup in drag as blondes may require more than some audiences can conjure up nevertheless logic has nothing to do with enjoying this threadbare but entertaining comedy along the way the wayans ridicule thin girls who insist they are horrendously fat at the same time the wayans show considerable sympathy and compassion for underdog girls however somewhere along the way the wayans forgot about jokes and devoted more time to plot complications and exposition furthermore isnt so much racial as it is cultural unfortunately after the guys go undercover as gals they learn nothing from their experiencecast as accidentprone fbi agents shawn and marlon wayans get the chance to redeem themselves after a stinggonebad against drug dealers if they can crack a kidnapping plot against two high society bimbos tiffany and brittany wilson anne dudek and maitland ward that want nothing to do with our dimwitted duo the opening sequence establishes how our heroes rely on latex disguises to trap evildoers but they take their ideas farther than anybody imagines when they try to impersonate the wilson sisters initially after being assigned to escort the wilsons to a ritzy weekend in the hamptons marcus copeland marlon wayans careens into a ditch and the gals wind up with scratches on their faces these blond wasps refuse to attend a party in the hamptons so they can recuperate from their scars meanwhile marcus and his brother agent kevin shawn wayans realize they must do something if they want to keep their badges so they have latex masks made and pad themselves to resemble the wilsons naturally they couldnt fool anybody in the costumes they wear but such is part of the wacky offbeat humor of watching the wayans try to behave like caucasian cuties is pretty funny they wear blue contact lens obvious wigs and have devil of a time getting into and out of their costumes in the shallow script penned by shawn marlon and keenen ivory wayans a brawny athlete takes a liking to marcus in his wilson girl disguise and pursues him with the same devotion that joe e brown chased jack lemmon in some like it hot nobody else in the movie makes much out of the fact that our heroes look twice as big as the other women especially the gals who accept them as the wilsons sadly despite the hilarity of seeing the wayans impersonate women doesnt deliver enough comedy to get it over its dull spots,comedy
wow what a kneeslapper this movie was hilarious but the racist remarks got on my nerves i love how the guys who disguised themselves dont even sound like the twins but people dont notice anyway the part where one of the guys is lactose intolerant and is in the bathroom is one of the funniest parts there some parts were so unrealistic it was funny the whole concept of 2 guys trying to be women is awesome even though often used dont have a younger audience watch this though i suggest this movie for sleepovers you wont be disappointed i thought the part with the dance off with the fen fen twins was a bit stupid except for when the 2 guys started to breakdance also i didnt like how the cast the fen fen twins they looked a bit skinny for the part other than that nothing really got on my nerves about this movie if you like slightly gross stupid humor see it if your practical and dont like it dont see it or try it out for the heck of it,comedy
well ive seen this movie twice the second time i made my boyfriend watch it i forgot how funny it is this one really tickled me as being a tacky over the top comedybut in a good way there is one particular character who is a classic if you havent seen this film hes the black shiny buff guyjust watch his classic performancemade me cry laughing i wont bother telling you the story as most people probably already have all ill say isthese two brothers the wayans brothers made me chuckle in scary movie and they certainly made me laugh in this filmif you dont find this movie funny at allthen where is your sense of humour ,comedy
ill start with 2 questions1 can anyone who actually saw this movie give me a reason not to like it 2 has anyone ever actually met someone like the terry crews character a lot of people wondered if this movie would stack up to tootsie when it first came out i think that it left hoffman in its dust hoffman wasnt trying to look like anyone specific just a random woman sean and marlon wayons pulled it off not only as women but as the wilton sisters even though the actresses had bare bones resumes prior to this movie and were probably selected primarily because they resembled sean and marlon in makeup the resemblance of the characters sets this movie apart from its predecessors this had the advantage of allowing marlon wayans confused male pursuer to actually end up with the woman he desired despite the fact that marlon wayans was not a woman and more importantly to his pursuer not whitenow before anyone points out that martin lawrence beat them to the punch in big mamas house i should mention that they added another dimension as well with having 2 characters go under cover there was no need for the agent who was in on the gag you know the agent who happens to have as clients both this man who mysteriously disappeared and this woman who looks exactly like him and mysteriously appears at precisely the same time sean and marlon wayans could commiserate with each other over what they had to go through also marlon wayans could dress like a woman and go on a date with terry crews while sean wayans could dress like a man and pretend to be terry crews in order to simultaneously search his apartment and impress a female news reporter and of course terry crews could overhear marlon wayans telling sean wayans that theyd meet up at the club later to which crews replied oh no my brother youve got to get your own in addition sean wayans could meet a woman and pursue a relationship while marlon wayans was able to repair things with his wife this would not have been possible had only one of them went undercoverits a shame that they were unable to cast brittnay daniels real life twin sister cynthia even though they worked together in the tv series sweet valley high in the role of her sister but thats about the only flaw of the movie i keep wanting to say that it fell short in some area but i just cant it was hilarious it didnt take itself too seriously it definitely addressed what women go through it addressed what the elite have to go through it was definitely not predictable other than botching an assignment and overcompensating by doing some dirty work and the whole message that women just want men to communicate more with them id say that they really didnt rely on too many clichs either it even addressed some myths about interracial couples by showing how ridiculous they would look were they actually true,comedy
when this movie first came out i promised myself i wouldnt see it finally it came onto cable and that is when i viewed it i had to at first i didnt know what to think its slightly creepy to see them as two women granted the two ugliest women but i digress i guess that adds to the comedy as the movie went on i felt it had some really great parts that i found myself laughing out loud at i knew it wouldnt be the greatest movie ive ever seen or even the funniest but it definitely had its moments latrell spencer on the dance floor was one of them i think you have to have an open sense of humor to enjoy it not everyone will like itso all in all what do you expect from this movie not some type of prestigious award it doesnt exactly move you but it does supply its purpose of having a few laughs,comedy
i never wanted to see this movie  because of the fact  i dont like the wayans  especially these two the only wayans i do like  is damon wayan  because i know his wife and their kids  great family anywho this movie turned out to be rather a little fun and the only part that didnt make sense was at the end at the party  when everything was coming to a end and the two brothers had to take off their masks  now  they both had blue eye contacts on  but when they took off their mask  the contacts also came off did you see that when they took off the fake masks  their eyes where suddenly brown that just freaked me out other than that  the movie was a lot of fun,comedy
i seen this movie in theaters when it first came out and ordered it on ppv the other day and i have to say this is one of the funniest movies i have seen in a long time i liked it a lot and would recommend it to anyonei think that the twins do a great job in this movie and that they really have outdone themselves however this movie could have been a lot more believable you really cant believe that these 2 could have passed for two women i also think that there should have been more alist actors in this movie such as mr t i think he would have played a better part of buffy the girl slayer,comedy
one of the few laugh out loud movies ive seen in a long time i was in a fit of giggles on several occasions as was my husbandand yes i was totally sober and no we rarely agree on movies several of my coworkers saw the movie and enjoyed it so i was surprised to see the low rating on the board i have a hard time understanding why anyone would watch this expecting a believable storyline its the movies folks  let go use your imagination and enjoy i almost hate to break it to the folks that were disappointed with the idea of the makeup on the wayan brothers not being believable  but there really are no such thing a green ogres either,comedy
i am a 41 year old woman mother to two teens my daughter and i just saw and totally enjoyed the movie i went in wondering what i was going to have to sit through since i am not particularly a fan of the scary movies that the wayans star in and then laughed throughout the entire chick movie if you think they are racist then dont go to the movie watch archie bunker or better yet just lighten up it is only in fun and it is nothing that has not been done in reverse over the years it is only a movie the wayans brothers were right on track portraying rich shallow air heads the wayans brothers must have spent a lot of time watching those two real hotel girls because they did an excellent jobcongrats to the wayans brothers on their movie,comedy
the film is a goof but is simply hilarious at timesthe story is weak with some real errors in logic and timeline problems but this isnt the sort of film in which you contemplate such thingsthe wayans make feelgood films and thats what is all about sean and marlon create such loopy goofy characters that you just enjoy spending time with them race class sexuality and materialism are all addressed with a soft touch but at least they made a stab at these issues  with humorsome gags are obvious and slow the dog for example but the audience i saw it with in jaded la about half black half and other laughed throughout and some of us laughed so hard we cried in some scenesits a little long but the wayans must bring these girls back for more,comedy
is a farts and racial humor comedy from three of the wayans brothers  the story is about the attempts by two bumbling black undercover male fbi agents shawn  marlon to blend into the hamptons ny society by assuming the identities and looks of two rich sisters they were assigned to guard  the sisters brittany and tiffany  but think paris and nicky are played by maitland ward and anne dudek  there are some funny moments with an all too predictable plot  gross humor and languagegrade  b,comedy
two black fbi agents kevin and marcus shawn and marlon wayans have gone undercover to bust a drug dealer but their sting falls apart their boss gives them a new assignment to escort two hotel heiresses brittany and tiffany wilson to the hamptons the fbi has received word that there is a plot to kidnap the sisters at the hamptons   as they are driving from the airport to the hamptons the girls little dog goes out the window and causes them to have a wreck  the two girls end up with cuts on their faces in the wreck  brittany and tiffany take a stand and refuse to go to the hamptons looking like this  if they dont go the kidnapping plot will not occur  kevin and marcus will fail again and probably lose their jobs they decide to disguise themselves as the wilson sisters and catch the kidnappers this is one funny movie and the audience will laugh from beginning to end  one word describes this movie  hilarious  columbia pictures run time 145 rated pg13 810,comedy
but i attended a screening last week and actually found myself laughing out loud on many occasions the film typifies black people as much as it does people and maintains an even cynicism throughout i know i know i wasnt looking forward to seeing the film i have to see movies like this in my line of work but i can honestly say i was surprised by how much fun i had while watching it and even found myself recommending it to friends the next dayhonestly im not an easy sell when it comes to movies stepped up to the plate early on and kept hitting a home run throughout the duration of the story just keep in mind that its supposed to be a silly nonracist comedy its not to be taken as seriously as people are making it out to be go figure go see it,comedy
just came back from the world premiere of here in westwood i would have to say that it is one funny laugh out loud film shawn and marlon wayans are as funny as ever undercover as two rich hotel heiresses the one who steals the show however is terry crews the muscular tougherthenhelooksguy who likes women despite is moments if you like toilet humor off the wall jokes the previews of the film gives you whats in store and a film that pokes fun at societys perception of people some jokes are racial however none are particularly offensive or overblown then a step above the wayans scary movie will give you a funny and hilarious time at the movies 510,comedy
im not sure it was quite the vote i gave it but well come to that in a moment i loved this film the jokes the gags the characters the obvious ripoff of paris hilton makes it so great not for the faint hearted i grant you but really worth watching do not listen to a certain ahead in the forums who doesnt know what theyre talking about race jokes are funny when there is no intent especially if it is your own race saying it about themselves  ive worded that wrong but oh well there are jokes about whites and blacks in here so someone open minded shouldnt complaini gave it 1010 to negate the 110 votes that the nonviewing haters have given it cast your vote today and beat the haters,comedy
i have to say the more i watch the better it becomes marlon and shawn are brilliant writers and producers every moment cracked me up i cant live without this movie its so funny and full of action all the comical parts were so well written i cant believe they reached such level of intelligence this movie is great to watch by yourself with mates or even with your folks i think the best lines were cracked by the wayan brothers obviously and i really want to see more of their material definitely shows off their talentdefinitely a must see and must buy ps love you shawn xx  your dedicated supporter,comedy
god whats wrong with you people for those of you who gave this movie such a low score you are the ones that sound racist i was reading some of your comments its almost scary the way you hate this movie wow calm down people take a deep breath maybe if you really look at the movie you will find out that it makes a joke about everyone even black people its not racisti believe that those of you that hate this movie so much never gave it a chance even before you saw it you already had prejudgments this didnt allow you to sit back and enjoy so i say its not the movie thats racist its youi liked this movie i laugh every time i watch it i am not 12 yrs old by the way im 24 i guess that im open minded not racist and so not uptight like you people seem to bewho cares if they look horrible as women who cares if some jokes are played out who cares it is a funny movie its all that matters jesus give it a break these are men they werent going to look like perfect womenyou people are complaining that if this were the other way around and men were playing black women that it would bring chaos ok well let me tell you this i cant count how many times black and hispanics are portrayed as criminals and lowlives in movies or you are telling me that you never noticed you people are a bunch of whining babiesok everyone else i loved this movie rent it see it its cute and funny by the way im a woman ciao my friends,comedy
i have to say that i was extremely disappointed by even the unrated version i am a huge wayans brothers fan but i can not bring myself to enjoy this movie over and over again not to say that there arent any funny moments but the first half of the film is lifeless it was as if they were trying too hard to make the audience laugh i love marlon shawn and keenan as much as the next fan but they have to work on there material basically nothing memorable like im used to the story has possibilities but there just arent enough laughs for me if youre thinking about checking it out i wouldnt recommend it over many other wayans classics such as scary movie 12 im gonna git you sucka a low down dirty shame dont be a menace to south central while drinking your juice in the hood major payne and even senseless these are all far better films i think my rating of 610 is being generous,comedy
i loved this movie rented it from blockbuster and watched it 3 times in one night overall the wayans are always known for spiffs or material that will mock anything that is current in our society no one should be offended the movie equally brought the attention of the following lifestyles the rich and famous and their spoiled children career and professional individuals and middle class people reagardless of color or race there is a lot that we as humans can look into another culture of lifestyle and compare it to ourselves in a comical manner rent the movie prior to commenting on it ps  many of us watch the dave chappell show in record numbers this movie was a lighter material but still will register the same amount of laughs as the dave chappel show definitely add this dvd to the home collection,comedy
manwhat is going on i just checked out on dvd recently and thought that it was such a funny movie ill check out what you guys thought of itwhy oh why did you guys give it such a low score thanks to 911 have we human beings forgotten how to laugh at ourselves again has our species become sooo wound up and up tight that humour black humour has become an ugly evil and twisted concept i dont know what is going on over the pond i am a uk citizen but im sorry you yanks cos im pretty sure yanks gave it the overall low score have quite simply lost your sense of humoursa real shame here in the uk we have to laugh need to laughand i guess thats pretty evident given the fact that uk comedy shows like the office and little britain are taking the us by stormcmon guys its ok to laugh believe meand with regards to the so called racism pllllleeeaaassseeeee as far as i can tell the wayan brothers are both black they rip into both black and cultures sure it aint pc or intellectual or political but hey its called a comedyyou know like back in the days when eddy murphy gave us the brilliant totally unpc trading placesgod i dread to think what you yanks would have given that comedy classic in this day and ageplease people the world may be going down the tubes there is a lot to moan and complain about but if we really lose our sense of humours then we really might as well call it a day now rather than lateras for my rating 9  10so if you still have your sense of humour intact check this film out youll laugh your pants off,comedy
as you can see by looking at the other comments youll either love it or hate it the problem is if someone is going to tell you its a great flickchances are you wont like it because youve got on your thinker or critics hat oni went into the movie thinking  this is gonna suck and therefore i approached it as just a little light entertainmentbecause of the excellent latino interpretation the wayan brothers did in the beginning and the schwarzenegger accent of the icecream delivery guy the mood was seti had a big smile on my facewhich remained on my face for the rest of the movieonly to be interrupted by bursts of loud laughter my wife and i laughed so loud in some parts of the moviethe bed shooki have to admit we both havent laughed at a movie so loud for a long long time the humour is definitely on a teenage level but i refuse to let that get in the way of a good laugh a lot of people might find some of the stuff too offensive for their kids to see but i actually found it good clean humour and would easily let my 7 and 8 year old boys watch itfringe  terry crew is definitely the man of the match so to speak his facial expressions alone are worth seeing the movie forconclusion  all in all this could be a fun movie if you are in the right mood enjoyment rating 810 plot 010,comedy
to me this movie was one of 5 best actioncomedy movies the only kind of people who wouldnt like this movie are racists and sick people whose idea of a good comedy movie is a combination of pornography sex violence gore or drug use this movie is one of the very few movies today that dont have any of these all it has is mild language this movie combines action and comedy and takes it to the next level for those rude people who are saying it isnt funny enough sorry but this is only clean comedy for clean minds also it has suspense and action this is better than 99 percent comedy and 1 percent action like the movie austin powers if you liked this movie look for the rush hour trilogy starring jackie chan and one of the funniest guys on the planet chris tucker,comedy
i took my husband to see this assuming he would like it and i would tolerate itwe both loved itthe theatre was packed everyone was laughingi took my daughters to see it 2 days lateri dont think there was one f wordproof we can be entertained without it and enjoy ourselves i just really appreciate that i was allowed to use my imagination this is family entertainment as far as i am concerned we will get the dvdi would like to thank the wayans brothers for making this filmi wish some other movie producers would take note we are looking forward to the next wayans projectnext time i will be eager to see it,comedy
is no 4 star comedy or no excellent movie but it is still entertaining and funny when i was about to see i knew i didnt want to pay 6 dollars for a movie that looks terrible when i could go see anchorman i saw it and i thought it was funny its not hilariousis like trash funny the wayans brothers were great actually i loved there voices and there laughs were great the story was low on juice and actually some of the humor was pathetic somethings in the movie are like what the heck did that come from most of the humor was very stupid but the wayans brothers delivered very funny performances6510,comedy
the wayans brothers dont seem to fail on us everything theyve put out from dont be a menace to the scary movie series has been comic genius their latest effort has shawn and marlon wayans playing two agents undercover as heiresses now theyve gotten a lot of backlash from the community for their portrayal of women but come on we saw this in soul man where the man dressed up in blackface and had on a afro wig but anyway this film is hilarious but most of the laughter came from the cat and mouse chase between terry crew and marlon wayans crews character latrell thought that marlons character was a real woman and throughout the whole 2nd half of the movie he chased after him it was a sight to see but other than that the movie as a whole was good the best comedy so far in 2004,comedy
from my opinion this is a great movie it is funny as hell i am korean and i saw it it with my 3 caucasian friends and we all thought it was hilarious i could understand how some people may interpret this movie as being racist but if you dont focus on something as negative as that and just sit back and watch the movie you will realize that it is very funny the situations that they get themselves into are so funny and it is just hilarious to see 2 black men portray 2 i suggest this movie to anyone with a decent sense of humor i love the wayans bros scary movie and scary movie 2 were great and i loved their tv show that is one talented family,comedy
i dont understand why people have to call this movie racist if they have never seen it everyone has different taste in humor and if you think the movie is racist then thats your opinion dont use a movie critique as a way to express your racist views i get along with all races and treat people the way i want to be treated there are racist people in all of our races this movie was ok but im just not a fan of the wayans brothers comedy i find them a little over the top and kinda stupidthey make fun of all people with stereotypes that are overly exaggerated thats why its not all that funny to me anyway all the races should respect each other and get along racism will never end so just deal with it and make the best life for yourself that you can,comedy
this is a perfect drivein movie  i saw it over the weekend and it is one of the funniest movies i have seen in a long time  i mean laugh out loud humour  ive always been a fan of the wayan brothers from keenan in im gonna git you sucka to marlon  shawns tv show titled the wayan brothers on wb in the 90s  this movie has a nice flow to it and you can see some elements of other movies in it  the battle scene at the club between the rival hampton girls was like what you would have seen in a movie like breakin 2electric boogaloo in the 80s  one actor who really shines in this movie is terry crews  he plays a football star who only has a taste for women  he has some comedic skills that really make this movie come alive  is by no means a movie to be taken seriously its a funny movie that will make you forget your problems for an hour and a half,comedy
i watched this tonight and i thought it was pretty funny actually pretty cool movie for everyone to see this summer it has everything you want in it dancing shooting fighting parties and two of the funniest black brothers waynes bros being lol great great movie going to see it one more time  there were a lot of hot girls in the movie which a lot of people will appreciate another thing i enjoyed was the battle between the two groups  enemies which i thought was cool another thing that was fun was the wife who always thought he was cheating but i dont want to give to much away but go watch it again if u like it if not then sooo sad,comedy
i have seen this movie and i havent laughed this hard in a long time it was a great movie if you want to laugh if youre looking for a deep story line or a plot that will take a long time to decipher this isnt the movie for you also this is a movie for all ethnic backgrounds when i went to see it at the lakewood mall id say about 13 was 13 black and the rest were filipinos mexicans and others and there wasnt one person who walked out who still wasnt laughing the wayans brothers really outdid themselves in this movie the costumes may not look so real but thats the funny part about it in the movie no one even knows they are really just black guys and that really trips them up at some points in the movie for instance when they turn the radio station and a rap song comes on they start singing it then when they say the nword the girls turn off the radio and are like you said the nword but then they think for a second and say but nobodys around and then they start singing the song saying the nword along with it but in the end this movie isnt a direct hit on girls but both black and people so this movies for just about everyone and everyone who gets the chance should see it,comedy
this garners no laughter for me whatsoeverthe only thing that keeps it above a one was the ending when the friends of the two likes the parodies of the two girls better than the real girls which made me see some heart  but still i wonder about purposeif its meant for laughs it didnt achieve it the few moments when it could have been funny are either played up way too much or rely on the stereotypical nature of caricatures or some moment where it actually becomes offensive in its humor  and i love dark humorit actually reminds me at moments of freddy got fingered which has been stated by some to be nearly an art film it has so little purpose if you want to watch a movie watch anything else anything even the scary movies are more entertaining than this with some decent acting and jokes that at least mostly rely on surrealistic sex not one you go black youre in a wheelchair  shudder,comedy
really enjoyed viewing this film which starts off with two crazy looking guys in a bronx ny stationery store waiting for a shipment of icecream which is believed to be a drug shipment shawn wayanskevin copeland and marlon wayansmarcus copeland are the crazy guys and are suppose to be undercover fbi agents this mission gets all messed up and these two guys get assigned to some very rich who are going to the hamptons on long island ny things get messed up again and the guys decided to dress in drag will all the bulges in the right places there is drama and plenty of laughs and if you want a good entertaining film this is your best bet,comedy
its a great film its really funny keeps my whole family laughing the fact that they dont even look like the girls people need to get a sense of humour its better than spy hard i watch it every night dont get enough of it there should be a 2 i wouldnt recommend it to anyone who gets easily offended by sexism and racism as it contains mild of both i would recommend it to anyone who likes a good laugh and isnt easily amused as it would make you laugh the thing that disappointed me about this movie is that it took long to get into but what pleased me about this movie is the fact that the humour is well used,comedy
i could easily relate to this movie because it is making fun of the hilton sisters who i like the wilson sisters get in a car accident and they looked ruined kevin and marcus copeland disguise as them and they hang out with the wilson sisters friends karen tori and lisa the best performance in the film is jaime king as one of the vangergeld sisters who are the wilson sisters rivals my favorite seen is the dance off seen between the wilsons and the vangergeld one problem is that latrell bidded the most for marcus disguised as one of the wilson sistersthis movie has great music and is original i thought scary movie was too crude i am happy the wayans bros stopped doing the scary movies to do this funny movie,comedy
how did no one think that it was funny i really enjoyed it was i the only person who enjoyed it on this site my favourite part is when theyre in the club dancingand when they walk in to the hotel and oops theyre newhow could yous not find that funny i watched it with my friends and we still laugh about it now well i enjoyed it and i think you have to have a sense of humour to enjoy a wayans bros production but honestly i would recommend this film to anyone who hasnt seen it yet please go out and see it now rent it just do something then come back on to this site and tell the world what you think,comedy
since i first saw the preview i knew i wanted to see this movie and i was not disappointed at all i have never laughed so hard in my life this movie was so funny the wayans brothers did a terrific job with the acting writing and directing shawn and marlon are flawless together i dont think there is anything that these brothers cannot accomplish together i loved their movie scary movie and i have always enjoyed their humour but this movie was more than i expected plus its always nice to see guys understanding a woman even if it is just in a movieif you feel like a nice out of the ordinary comedythen this is the film for you but i should warn you some scenes are not suitable to watch while trying to take a drink of your soda cuz that stuff is just going to come flying out when you least expect it,comedy
i am a black man from ghana west africa and i must say that this was a very good movie and i was totally impressedlike many of u i also thought it wasnt going to be funny since some reviewers gave it a low votebut i wasnt fooled cos many of u movie watchers and critics are too uptightnow lets break the movie a bitthe very beginning where they were disguised us old men buyin ice cream was funny to me the 2nd time i watched it the first time it was like a sort of intro for u to know what the character was about the comedy really kicks up when they become the wilson sisters in disguisethere u laugh till u cant laugh no moreone of my favourite parts was the dildo partnow that scene was so funny to me i almost died from laughteri recommend this movie to anyone who sees things on the lighter side and is not too uptightcos this movie is for all colours in fact it actually makes u want to date a chickas a black man from ghana  africa i certainly do the wayan brothers are good remember a low down dirty shame with keenen this is just as funny if not funnier,comedy
okay so it was only shown in my area last week but better late than neveri do agree with some of the other comments that some of the humor was racist but lets face it the jokes rang true didnt they at least partly anyway so who cares if the movie had a successful black guy always running after no one can tell me there are none of those and so what if the two wilson sisters were a couple of ditsy dumb blonds prove to me there are none of those the movie didnt generalize it didnt say all blonds are stupid and shallow or all black men want women it actually showed the two lead characters played by the two wayanses actually being better than that they showed character by not focusing on the superficiali dont think the movie should be taken too seriously of course jokes are halfmeant but cmon its the wayanses they poke fun at everyone even each other,comedy
i watched this movie and dodge ball on the same day i was really surprised i thought this film was going to stink i was wrong it was funny and light hearted its a comedy movie although at times it tries to inject an actual plot which only comes across as corny nevertheless those scenes are fewthis is actually a good movie to watch marlon wayans was really good just looking at his face you know that hes silly and his character fit while shawn on the other hand is more subdued than marlon but still he was good also they both were natural and didnt overreacti dont know why this movie wasnt more popular than dodge ball but this one is way better,comedy
an amusing comedy from the wayans brothers team has shawn  marlon wayans as fbi agents who have to impersonate two who i suppose are a joke on the hilton sisters in the hamptons the reasons for the impersonation scam are pretty silly but its just a setup for some amusing mistaken identity gags and some really funny jokes i actually laughed quite a bit in this film and i went into it not expecting very much at all busy phillips who some might remember as katey holmes roommate on the last couple seasons of dawsons creek plays one of the friends they make in the hamptons and she is really quite good in this displaying more range than she did on the tv show a pretty fun film all in all grade b,comedy
i cant believe a bunch of snobby idiots gave this movie a low rating 34 stars puhlease this movie made me laugh so much my cheeks and abdominal muscles were hurting and it was genuine laughter sure it was campy and goofy and hardly intelligent at all but who gives a rats a it was a perfect movie for an otherwise boring friday night my favorite parts were the faces the girls made the break dancing scene the car scene where all the girls were singing vanessa carlton and the lactose intolerance episodethis is the best movie they wayans bros have made and they havent made many good ones in my opinion sure a lot of was cheap laughs but oh freakin well whoever doesnt like it can go rent lost in translation yawn and talk amongst yourselves over your whine and cheese,comedy
this movie was hilarious it was one of the most enjoyable laughoutloud grab your stomach films ive seen in the past few years i expected funny moments but had no idea it would have such a great easytofollow and easytobelieve plot not just jokes but a comedy thats smart kudos to the wayans for hooking up another sizzling phat funny joint sean and marlon are believable as an fbi team always trying to go for the big bust to make a name for themselves in the bureau similar to eddie murphy in beverly hills cop they get the job done sort of but keep making big messes of everything along the way the rest of the cast mostly uppity hampton and a successful black pro ball player who loves girls are offthechain funny too the writing for the film makes everyone in it shine,comedy
i still laugh every time i see this movieit makes me feel happy and comfortablei wish they make part 2,comedy
this movie has become one of my favorite movies for down days it is truly hysterical and so many different ways but i wouldnt overthink it if you just sit back relax and watch the movie and laugh and how terrible it is and then laugh at the actual jokes and take it for what it is and you will absolutely love this movie dont think about the acting just think about the situation itself and you will laugh i think the wayans brothers did an amazing job with the simplicity of the movie,comedy
hilarious marlon wayans is just naturally funny some stupid parts but lots of hilarious parts and terry crews is an awesome addition about 4 viewings,comedy
not that bad a film a few laughs here and there obviously this film isnt for everyone its a bit like big mommas house but id say a little better,comedy
look this is the kind of movie where youre not supposed to read into the fine details of things prosthetics are bad but i think that makes movie even funnier one of my all time favourites great laugh for a lot of the move,comedy
has a really funny concept 2 black males pretending to be 2 females it is very funny and has some solid jokes sometimes it can get a bit cringy with some of the jokes if you have watched it you will know which bits but it still is a solid good film,comedy
i think the movie was long enough i know this focuses on comedy more but i think they should have add more action scenes into this movie this movie could have been better if they added more action scenes and this movie is great to watch with friends and can lighten up your day if you are sad overall i think this movie is a 7610 by the way this movie is underrated and i dont believe people who gave this movie such a low rating this movie is entertaining and funny and a bit action recommend this movie,comedy
is a comedy movie in which we follow the lives of two fbi agents who after making some major mistakes are considered a disgrace for the agency their superior section chief assigned them a last mission as a final test in order to prove what they are capable of and prove that they worth their possessions in the agency their mission is very simple to go undercover and keep the wilson sisters safe from a kidnapping ploti liked this movie because it had a simple but funny plot with many hilarious scenes and also some funny stereotypes the direction which was made by keenen ivory wayans it was very good and there was an evolution in the main characters of the movie something that i really enjoyed regarding the interpretations of the cast i have to admit that shawn wayans who played as kevin copeland and marlon wayans who played as marcus copeland were simply amazing another interpretation that has to be mentioned is terry crews who played as latrell spencer and he was also very funnyfinally i have to say that is an above average movie with a simple but interesting and funny plot i recommend everyone to watch it because i believe that you are going to have a lot of fun and i am sure that you are going to enjoy it very much do not expect some outstanding interpretations or deep meanings etc its just a good comedy movie to spend your time with and of course to laugh,comedy
as i watched this complex  well made future classic  part comedy part mystery thriller part social commentary i was reminded of ingmar bergmans classic face to face the wayans brothers uncanny similarity in appearance to liv ullman when in face not withstanding it was the deep complexity of the piece that reminded me of the earlier work not its chilling psychodrama coreif you recall in bergmans piece  a shrink and his wifes relationship was stressed when ullman descended into mental illness while in whit chicks it seems more that the wayans actually look to be mentally ill when they put on face the result is stunning or perhaps shocking is a more appropriate term the fact that they almost become ullman in the process if you recall if liv were any whiter she would be clear is not lost on audiences of a certain age and breeding having experienced  and survived the 70s  we immediately identify a deep character study using anglo saxon mores as a backdrop while the pseudo rape cultural collegiate milieu serves brilliantly as a hysterical scaffolding a psychobabble matrix if you will fitting perfectly in todays you too sceneit all coalesces to create a piece no less than stunning and it will be deemed a classic in due time many agree ingmar bergman robert altman john waters step aside the wayans have arrived and created vitally their own new social commentary niche film the reversereverse racist diatribe rant which double negative makes it actually not racist  at all,comedy
you know you shouldnt but its just too damn good to shout no objection much like with my transporter 2 review there are films i acknowledge as bad i know in my head that this film is terribly atrocious racist misogynistic homophobic sexistevery bad connotation that target social demographics yetsomewhere deep inside the abyss that is my souli just love watching this comedy two black undercover agents must disguise themselves as two rich sisters sure theres a crime story involving a drug bust and kidnapping but me and you both know that we dont care for that dont even pretend that you wanted an engrossing story the premise itself is obscenely stupid on all levels no no what you wanted was onscreen idiocy and uncomfortableness from the wayans brothers as they dress up terribly shoddily act and look scarily bizarre as its stupid beyond all measures so weird that we need to invent an entirely new scale in an attempt to calculate the immeasurable surrealism of chicks are right chickens i dont laugh at comedies you all know that but this film has me in fits of laughter every time possibly the most quotable comedic screenplay of all time i mean that what a beautiful chocolate man ohhh you want to talk about mothers and giving a new surge of life to vanessa carltons a thousand miles terry crews is life is life but terry crews in double life powerrrr hes flipping hilarious i cant even jennifer carpenter was surprisingly great as well somebody throw shamu back in the ocean ha ha haaaa im done i realise that im probably still drunk from this weekend which was just as hilarious as this comedy stupid basic execution and rather offensive but ummm exsqueeze me i dont care funnily terrible is the best way to describe wait does that even make sense i dont even know anymore i just want my sequel,comedy
not usually a huge fan of wayans in general but this movie never fails to make me laugh yes its stupid but some of the one liners are epic and terry crews is a gem give it a go if it doesnt make you smile at least 2 or 3 times id be amazed,comedy
the acting is alright the storyline is a bit out there the sets are unimpressive and the costumes are okay at best and the wonderful thing is you dont care about any of that this is not a hard hitting drama its not a revolutionary piece of artistic expression except maybe it is so many movies go out of their way to have big amazing sets with costumes that transport you to another world they include big movie stars with years of acting expertise they have millions to spend on witty writing and believable plots and yet somehow most movies fail to achieve what has done with so little the movie is in two words rewatchably hysterical i have watched this more times than i can remember and each time it causes me to laugh out loud it has a kind of enticing silliness that i almost never like in movies i am a champion of fresh and deep movies that really break the mould and make you think about the more serious things in life but for some reason is the exception to that rule i wish i could say what it is that makes this movie so good but for the life of me i do not know all i know is that if you watch this without prejudice and so long as you have a sense of humour then you will enjoy this movie it is a piece of simple beauty a lighthearted film to lift your spirits and widen your smile because like life its just about enjoying yourself,comedy
if you want to howl with laughter you should watch is a comedy that was released on june 23 2004 in the united states the stars in this movie are shawn wayans marlon wayansterry crews faune chambers jaime king brittany daniel maitland ward anne dudek busy philippsjessica cauffieljennifer carpenter rochelle aytesjohn heard lochlyn munroeddie velez and frankie r faison the director of the movie is keenan wayanstwo fbi agent brothers marcus marlon wayans and kevin copeland shawn wayans agreed to escort and protect two twin hotel heiresses brittany and tiffany wilson to the hamptons from a kidnapping plot and go undercover when they soon realized that they are used as bait for a kidnapper the brothers have no choice but to pose as the sisters to bust the kidnapper in the beginning the brothers are disguised as two mexicanamericans who owned supposedly an ice cream shop to bust some drug dealers three men walked into the shop to give them some ice cream they ordered the brothers think they are the culprits and arrested them it turns out they caught the wrong men and the real drug dealers shows up and got away which leads their boss forcing them to escort the sisters in the next scene marcus and kevin are waiting for the sisters to show up so they can escort them while driving them to the destination an accident occurred leaving one of the girls with a scratch on her face and the other with a busted lip the girls complain about their marred faces and how they cannot come with their faces disfigured kevin tells them to just cover the scratches with makeup marcus worries and kevin comes up with an idea to dress up like them for their protection so he calls some makeup artists to transform them into women later the brothers who are posing as the sisters arrived at the hamptons and are approached by the friends of the twins karen lisa and tori they discuss about what have happened while they were gone while chatting and gossiping like girls always do two girls named heather and megan vandergeld shows up and ends up with them in a yo mamma joke battle heather and megan are enemies of brittany and tiffany and they are very rich later in the movie they meet again at a nightclub for a danceoff and brittany kevin and tiffany marcus wonone aspect of filmmaking i like is the acting i like how the actors stay in character and how funny they are for an example when one of the brothers who are posing as one of the sisters were trying on clothes with the sisters friends tried to make the clothes fit and the clothes ripped i laughed so hard also acting is very interesting and fun however i find acting very tedious acting takes a lot of practice and you have to work hard if you want to debut in a movie also i wonder how many people who auditioned for this movie another aspect of filmmaking is the setting the setting is cool and beautiful i like how they change scenes and how the background is detailed ive seen tons of movies with unique set designs all of them are interesting too in this particular movie i see where the scenes are filmed in different places like the mall and the hamptons the scenery is awesome and beautiful the director chose a great place to film this moviemy opinion about this movie is that it is hilarious the actors did wonderful and the plot is excellent i watched this movie several times and its still funny i recommend this movie to anyone who wants a laugh the wayans brothers and the casting crew did a good job some people found this comedy racist and unfunny however i think the movie wasnt racist at all people just dont understand humor when they see it,comedy
ive heard this film a long ago but i never interested to watch it we cant avoid them because when we look for a particular type of film for the occasion they will popup and that is how i watched this now i know it is a silly comedy because in a real world this thing never happen so knowing this is only for cinema i prepared to enjoy whatever it offers but i must say even though my rating is not big i kind of enjoyed itnobody watches this without knowing its synopsis so you will already know the fifty per cent of the story when you do the rest is how it is developed including how good the jokes are that comes with our watch so much clich but entertaining with some good scenes and lines the actors were excellent the makeups were not flawless but worked okay especially for a comedy because if there is an error it will going to appeals from the comedic sideso the overall film was better than what i presumed all these years glad i saw it its nothing like those silly comedies ive seen ive seen many imposter themes but this is refreshing all the above this is a one off film thats the best thing about it you know sequels are what degrades the original film in most of the scenarios thanks for that theres no followup for this with a b movie cast and crew this is a very much watchable film not comedy riot but fairly does its job610,comedy
this got many more eyebrow raises than laughs from me because of some of the style of comedy its all very ridiculous which isnt uncommon to comedies pretty much the entire movie is a series of extended situational comedy all pertaining to the irony of black cops posing as models it wasnt the most plausible plot basis in real life the guys would never have even gotten into the hotel without being discovered but in some ways the plot basis makes it a kind of universal comedy it can make jokes and black jokes and can be sort of a chick flick that appeals both genders it probably leans more toward a male audience than female but i think its sort of intended for both theres a light theme about how little men really understand women and vice versathere is barely even an attempt at a story but i dont think this will bother most people honestly keeping the plot vague was probably the best thing to do because nobody who enjoyed the sort of comedy featured was probably looking for a story to being with if somebody had this idea maybe three years later it would have turned into a series of youtube videos instead of a movie because its just a bunch of comedic scenes strung loosely together now most of the time movies are intended to tell stories but in the case of comedies where their purpose is just to entertain less story can be more billy madison would have been better if they didnt add in plot devices to keep it moving it didnt need it and as pathetic as the story for is it would have been worse if it were cohesiveas it was i wasnt a huge fan of the comedy this is for me what i think nacho libre and napoleon dynamite are for most people the only scene i really enjoyed was latrell singing a thousand miles everything else just evoked a bunch of eyebrow raises however if you are okay with lcd comedy that doesnt mind being over the top this is worth trying as you can probably infer from the title there are a decent amount of sexual and slightly racist jokes fortunately i dont think any of them will offend anyone too much i read another review that said it was discriminatory in the ditsy portrayal of women this is someone valid but its worth noting that the women characters are all models and are paid to be ditsy and frivolous to an extent its not saying that all women are like that but its understandable that the audience might react that wayif you do decide to watch it dont expect most of the movie to make sense because that will lessen your enjoyment of it i definitely recommend watching it with other people i would never have wanted to finish it on my own but my brother and sister both really enjoy it and that made it more fun to watch if you just want to give it a try watch the first 20 to 25 minutes before you decide whether to see the rest overall rating 6310,comedy

good old fashion funny ready to give laughs spread racial humor and give the audience a fun time with a movie designed just for that the wayan brothers have a successful line of comedy due to their natural charm and somewhat believable acting ive seen and witnessed this movie a few times but each time the same jokes are funny terry cruise certainly brings a light atmosphere and never fails to deliver the more or less enjoyable surprises for a man who looks tough enough to break bricks by merely flexing hes shown in this his equal skill to bring tears from laughter ive seen it a few time but still i suggest this movie to many if of course you can handle having your ribs hurt from time to time of this wacky thrill ride,comedy
i think this film is hilarious very funny and some very funny lines but one thing spoilt it for methe joke about starving african kids the bloated tummy line on the beach if you ever saw the pain and devastation that starvation causes and personally i have only seen images on tvim not a kill joy and have a sense of humour about most things and can have a joke about most things too but if i was an actoractress in this film i would have refused to say or have these tasteless lines in apart from that i like the film and this world has come to something if finding humour in little children that are bloated from malnutrition is funny,comedy
this is about black people they know how to make everyone laugh not being racist but the jokes about girls and black ghetto girls are the thing this is quite funny if you wanna watch it cable tv broadcast it every week go aheadacting was ok this girl gina and her ghetto friend made laugh real loud quote keasha call nay nay and laquanda this bitches are other shtghetto girls have it the yo momma jokes were great and that big dude latrelle he made me lolwell now getting serious and left those ghetto jokes overall this movie is quite funny you can watch it 2 times and still laugh,comedy
this movie is a great watch the first thing is you need to laugh at the two cops that dress up as its funny that everyone around them believe they look exactly like the wilson sisters if you cant move past that clever little part then you have no sense of humour and wont enjoy the film in fact a great scene occurs when the cops dressed up as appear on the runway with the real wilson sister and people look confusedalso the humour is fun and a little silly but its lighthearted humour the best scene is by far the dance off i love movie dance offs the relationship the chick has with latrell spencer is fun it really is a great film,comedy
i gave it a 10 because i still laugh every time i watch this on dvd take it for what it is people a comedy first of all its not racist only racists will think the plot is racist it isnt why would all the caucasians actors and actresses in this movie take their parts if they thought it was racist this movie makes fun of caucasians african americans geeks women men dorks etc the wayans brothers look funny as ever with the makeup on not like the real women they are portrayingbut thats partly what makes it funny terry crews is hilarious in all of his scenes all i can say is that i liked it very much and i still like it,comedy
first of all you have to suspend your disbelief going into this movie thinking that it isnt possible for the wayans brothers to play wont help you storywise this is all im going to reveal but i still wanted to put the spoiler tag then again there isnt so much story  as with many comedies to begin with its all about the premiseand this said premise sees two dudes dressed as women now if this sounds familiar you might have seen the classic movie some like it hot a really great movie that you shouldnt compare this with this is just nonsense fun and its pretty obvious theyre having fun here if you allow yourself to experience this ridiculous movie than you will have fun at least the first time around,comedy

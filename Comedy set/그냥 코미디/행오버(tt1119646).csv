most great comedies are based on fundamental truths  we find a deal of humour in the illumination of our own human tragedy office space is funny for example because weve all worked that type of job put up with that type of boss and suffered that type of monotonous everyday boredomtodd phillips new movie the is as aptly titled as anything else released this year its about a vegas bachelor party gone horribly awry in which the groom inexplicably disappears no one can remember a damned thing and mike tyson wants his tiger backyes weve all had those nights though perhaps not to such extremes thats where the exaggeration of comedy serves us the is funny because it takes this cultural ritual  an american tradition something almost all of us can relate to  and finds genuine humour in the pain of its aftermathi concede that bachelor party movies are not in short supply the genre if it is indeed a genre should have probably both begun and ended with the tom hanks flick almost three decades ago but the wisely studies the day after rather than the day itself this is funnier because the plot works backwards without tacky flashbacks and much of the evening in question is left to our imaginationwhile it would be misleading to claim this is a brilliant film in either regard  as comedy or character study its an assured picture that finds its footing immediately and achieves a surprising level of sustenance throughout its running time and frankly lets be honest this is a breath of fresh air its one of the best rrated comedies of the decade and certainly the most uproarious since superbad was released two years ago most rrated comedies produced today are defiant the rrating has become a hindrance to film studios sensibilities  everything is pg13 saving the shameless unrated schpeel for the dvd cut the occasional theatricallyreleased rrated comedy as such is infrequently modest the ads stress the rating to remind us what weve been missing for every legitimate offer such as forgetting sarah marshall were treated to movies like college that attempt to lure us into theaters based on the promise of raunchy decadence the problem is that its all so coldly calculated these films are not funny because a majority of the time they are simply lazy and dishonestthe simplest reason for the s success in being genuinely funny is the fact that it achieves a rare balance of character and vulgarity we laugh at the characters misfortunes because we like them we empathize with them and they are distinctly actualized are they stereotypical to a certain degree sure we have the repressed pussywhipped guy who obeys his girlfriends every command ed helms the weird john belushiesquire figure who speaks in non sequiturs and nave absurdities zach galifianakis and the womanizer whose confidence renders him automatic leader of the group bradley cooper its a testament to the strengths of these actors that they make their characters endearing and believable even in the face of total lunacyhelms has been an underrated highlight of the american office for the past several years never quite earning the praise he deserves his character on the show is played with pitchperfect perversity hes not overtly creepy like the programs other weirdo creed but rather subtly unnerving helms invests a great deal of nuance into what is ostensibly a throwaway supporting goofball this movie if nothing else will justly reveal his talentscooper uses his looks to his advantage its funny to watch handsome people exploit their securities cooper essentially turns your typical leading man figure into a bumbling idiot selfabsorbed and clueless its effective hes got great chemistry with the other guys and its fun to watch such an immoral and ruthless character take center stage in a mainstream comedygalifianakis a cult comedian who ive admired for years has been struggling quite a while not many people other than myself and sean penn saw his 2001 comedy out cold probably because it wasnt all that great but he was easily the most amusing aspect of the picture he once described himself as being gifted by the opposite of the midas touch with more than a few canceled tv shows to his credit including comedy centrals unheralded dog bites man but it seems his persistence has finally paid off he has discovered at last a movie of strong enough quality to reflect his talents galifianakis has a fair share of the films funniest dialogue as far as fat funny guys go many of them such as chris farley made the illfated mistake of playing dumb in a sharp fashion hurtful quips and silly oneliners all selfaware galifianakis plays his character straight and the laughs are subsequently heartier when he embraces his brotherinlaw while nude the act seems innocently awkward rather than deliberately awkward and thats what makes it so funny hes described in the by another character as a child with a beard imagine how funny it is when he names a caucasian baby carlos without any shred of condescension or knowing humourthe is surely destined to become the sleeper comedy hit of 2009 and more likely a cult flick in the years to come its more deserving of such acknowledgment than many recent successes and while we may live in an era saturated with unnecessary sequels i actually left the hoping to see these guys again and thats a rare feeling these days,comedy
with the exception of one character more later in this review i found this movie filled with male sophomoric humor having said that most of the females in the audience also enjoyed it kind of an equal opportunity movie to offend all sexes equallyunlike most trailers that show all the humor in a 60 second clip this movie will throw so many funny situations at you so quickly that you will be giggling nonstop for the first hourthen the introduction of the mr chow part  essential for the plot but played way over the top by ken jeong  became distracting up to that point bradley cooper ed helms justin bartha and zach galifianakis carried the movie briskly and with real chemistry zach galifianakis in particular was brilliant who is this guy the last 30 minutes were not as good as the first hour and i found the ending somewhat forcedhowever everyone i talked with after the movie will be seeing it again this is one movie that is as funny as advertisedof course i will get flamed by those who find this kind of humor too low brow for their tastes hey just know what youre getting into when you see this,comedy
i just saw the first screening of the movie and it is very worth the money you will pay for it i was skeptical about it at first thinking that the previews would have only the funny parts but they are just the tip of the iceberg everyone hit a home run in this movie even mike tyson generated a few laughs for everyone if you need a pick me up from a bad day just watch this and you will definitely feel better about everything that may be going wrong in your life i will definitely be buying this to watch over and over again once it comes out on dvd probably even see it in theaters again i hope you find this review helpful because this movie is definitely a must see in my opinion,comedy
i walked into this movie a little hesitant and man did i feel like a complete tool for doubting todd phillips once againi was hesitant for quite a few reasons one being that i was a little unimpressed with the trailer but trust me after you see this movie you will realize that most of the movie couldnt have possibly made it into the trailer another reason was the writers their previous works being the ghosts of girlfriends pasts and four christmases and rebound i dont know what they did between those and this but damn did they step their game upnow the movie is hilarious i have become so used to the thought of the judd apatow gang being the only ones to make truly funny films but i realized very quickly into this movie that i was dead wrong i think this movie was by far ten times funnier than pineapple express forgetting sarah marshall step brothers etc and i find each of those flicks truly hilariously funnyi remember watching superbad the first time and thinking that that was the funniest movie ever made when it comes to films with legitimate plots and characters etc and maybe superbad and the are pretty close but who knowsso please see this film the audience i saw it with was laughing hysterically every five minutes at least there is enough oneliners to quote all summer and enough subtle jokes to laugh about later on that you didnt catch the first timeoh and by the way if you love old school you will love the ending thats all i can say,comedy
i reckon it will be noted as the funniest film this year as i think it would be hard to top it is certainly the best comedy ive seen for a couple of years the cast were excellent with a truly great dynamic of main characters played by very talented comedic actors the performance that sticks out is zach galifianakis character alan zach has brought a fresh character to the screen and with the quality of this films script the combination of the two are what brings this to the point of a comedy masterpiece as a film fan who is partial to only rating thrillers and dramas with a sense of respect this film reminds me of how comedy can be the masterclass of cinema and the reason why we enjoy it so much my dad is not a fan of comedy as such and normally sees going to watch films of this type as a chore but to see him laugh as much as my brother and myself at 65 years of age shows how its humor can break not just an age gap but more importantly a persons taste in film i have absolutely nothing bad to say about this movie and do not wish to say anything about the story the best thing to do is to go and see this film for yourself and youll realize what im talking about,comedy
this is without doubt one of the most overrated comedy of all times the jokes are totally bland and boring and the whole concept has been done over a million times before  the story looked like a bunch of toilet jokes and elementary grade humor slapped together resulting in a forgettable comedy that definitely doesnt live up to the hype one of the worst moment in that movie was in the casino scene where they won over 800000 with the help of a black jack book i mean it looked like the script writer couldnt find a better way to get the characters out of that problem and he just went for the easy way with an all time classic and clich video editing scene just like the karate kid movies you know the whole be a champion in 2 minutes thing the acting in some scenes looked like it came straight from a forgotten bgrade  straight to vhs movie i know that a lot of people found that movie hilarious but i didnt find anything fresh in that movie it was the first time that at the end i pulled out my cellphone and started watching my sms out of boredom,comedy
after much anticipation the has finally hit theaters todd phillips returns raunchier than ever with a surprisingly consistent comedy loaded with bizarre situations ensued by lots of laughter from a live tiger in the bathroom to an abandoned baby in the closet this movie has everything seriously everything confirmed by the credit sequencephillips does not shy away from his formula the movie centers around four immature adults dumbfounded by the seemingly unexplainable result of a wild vegas night catalyzed by the foursomes out of control bachelor party set the day before one of the principle characters wedding the film is primarily seen through eyes of doug the groomtobe alan the lovable moron stu the hopeless one and phil the stud and in many ways the leader of the pack the director of old school does not shy away from shock humor but embraces it while gradually building confidence and self discovery within the characters overall the film triumphs through curiosity and chemistry just like the main characters we are eager to find out what happens or what did happen at the same time the strong relationship developed by the characters makes the viewer realize how much heshe cares about what ultimately happens to them chemistry is the secret to a good comedy it is about time somebody shows this understandingi dont want to reveal too much but let me tell you this everything does get explained in the end except for the chicken aimlessly walking around in the hotel room but i mean its a chicken all of the actors succeeded in their roles admirably and i wouldnt be surprised to see these guys in more lead roles ed helms hasnt made me laugh this hard since the daily show seriously guys go watch this movie you wont be disappointed,comedy
i have to start by saying that my friends and i have been talking about this movie and watching the trailers for weeks so our expectations were really highwith that being said this movie didnt just live up to the expectations it was one of the funniest movie i have seen in a long time bradley cooper zach galifianakis and ed helms are all very good galifianakis steals the show at times it is hilarious from the beginning mike tyson brings a few laughs and mr chow ken jeong is a great twist do yourself a favor and go see this movie it is worth every penny just got out of the midnight showing and im going back tomorrow night,comedy
every now and then theres a movie that has a lot of hype surrounding it and everyone seems to talk about it and without a doubt the is one of those moviesunfortunately it doesnt live up to or deserve the hype its getting i found it to be a rather empty comedy and i cant understand why so many people seem to think its so humorous apparently i wasnt the only one not to enjoy it the audience i was a part of barely let out a snicker during the entire flicki think a lot of the attempts at humor were forced and a lot of the jokes fell flat the acting wasnt very impressive either particularly that of zach galifianakisoverall id say to avoid this movie if you dont want to be disappointed is it the worst movie ive ever seen no however there are far better comedies out there id recommend over this for sure,comedy
after i saw this movie i rated it 2 out of 10 but after having a further think and discussion about it i reduced my score to 1 out of 10 why this movie is stupid most of the time it doesnt make sense a cop car thats stolen but theres no man hunt for it a tiger in the bathroom but theyre talking about it in the living room like theyve had it happen to them previously meanwhile the nerdy guy is more scared of his fianc than the tiger the hotel finds a bed thrown on a statue but assume it was thrown out of a window even though they dont have windows what the hell the tiger is drugged and put into their car to take it back to mikes place have you lifted a tiger lately i know they are trying to be funny but they lost me from the beginning by the time the photos are shown at the end i was already over it not only that there are absolutely no consequences in the end for any of them booooooorrrriiiinnggg yeah lets high five each other amazing that hollywood can produce this crap and promote it so hard and still make huge dollars in conclusion rent very bad things now thats a vegas movie and if you dont get whats going on in that movie like one person who called it an evil movie about a homicideits a black comedy,comedy
i feel burned for going to watch this super stupid movie i am baffled that so many other people in imdb thought it was funny and that it has good reviews there were about 30 people in the theater when i watched it of a pretty good demographic spread and there were nearly no laughs through out the whole movie at best a few people chuckled a few times some of the attempts at comedy are so so old ok here are a couple little spoilers in one scene one of the guys is face down on the ground about to get up  another one of guys opens up the car door and opens it bumping the guy laying down on the ground in the head so so stupid this scene was funny in cartoons when i was under 10 another spoiler coming in a different scene one of the guys finds a used condom in there car and they start grossing out and tossing it around so stupid and not funny anymore since i was 17 i can only understand the high reviews on imdb that there are so many more potheads these days if you are a pothead under 25 is the only demographic i can understand that can laugh from this,comedy
i cant believe this movie gets such high ratings i just wasted 15 hours of my life i decided to see it because everyone was so high about it i had such high expectations as a result of course oh man there is nothing more in the whole movie than in the trailers and to me the trailer was no fun either so you can tell if you are with me at this pointit started really slow and i was waiting for something to happen nope nothing at some point i expected a twist nope the tiger the baby the tooth the bed everything is just so forced it was like when conan obrien creates absurd situations and take a shot of that moment in his show conans creations are waaaay funny though i have to apologize from conan for comparing this movie to his absurd shots since he does them for what they are but these guys in is trying to sell a real funny story but i dont buy it not a bit sorryall those screams cursing unnecessary naked people and stupidness got me stressed i didnt enjoy it but go ahead and watch i may be the only person who is telling you that its not good just whatever,comedy
this movie was terrible to put it simply to look at it more thoroughly read oncharacter there was almost no character development in the movie one character learns any kind of lesson at all other than that everyone is the same character at the end of the movie as they were at the beginning and while im looking at the characters lets do some summaries we have the smug asshole the beyond idiotic weirdo the angry nerd and the uninteresting groom who also has an uninteresting bride who by the way has like four lines in the movieplot the idea of forgetting what happened in the night time and trying to put all the pieces together in the morning yeah its clever the problem is the movie was so short every problem they encountered had to either resolve its self or they solved it so quickly it wasnt really even a problem to begin with mike tyson comes and claims the tiger then they drive it back fascinating really im enthralled they see the hospital bracelet and the las vegas doctor remembers everything that four drunk guys said earlier that night not only that he leads them to there next clue right away maybe the doctor could have magically just told them where there friend was and those arent even the worst partsdialogue i hardly feel like touching this but lets go the nerd all he does is get abused and then start yelling then people laugh ha ha ha nerds yelling ha ha ha the weird dumb guy insert non sequitur here thats pretty much every line in the movie the pretty boy whos a dick well hes just mean and for no real reason and as for the uninteresting groom well he only has like four lines and they arent very goodin conclusion i wish i could rate this movie zero who ever programs this website might want to get started on that,comedy
its amazing browsing thru some of these 15 page orgasmic rave reviews to such an unoriginal lackluster filmvery bad things 5 guys go to vegas for a bachelor party and all hell breaks lose cops comedy suspsense i think they might have even been driving there from la4 guys drive from la to vegas for a bachelor party and all hell breaks lose cops comedy suspensei was amazed that the opening scene of hang depicts the story line just before the actual wedding and then after the short title sequence a caption appears saying two days earlier this had to happen within 4 minutes of the film vbt 1998 start with a scene just before the wedding ceremony showing the male actors all stressed out and then a captions says a few days earlier within about 2 minutes in hang the male actors are calling in to the wifey just before the wedding all stressed out with their potentially wedding altering circumstances not even original there as the notion of the wedding being called off due to the events leading up to it was already done in vbtvbt contained some of the best acting of the careers of the many known faces contained bad acting from a bunch of nobodys vbt even contained some gut wrenching special effects although compared to hang it didnt need any whereas hang was desperate for anything to spice it up in vbts wakevbt is a top notch dark comedy whereas hang attempts to enter the category and falls smack into its own dark crack,comedy
from the moment that i saw the trailer for the i knew i had to see this movie i dont think i had laughed so hard watching a trailer in my life but one thing i was kind of concerned about was how most movies just show the funny parts in the trailer and this would just be another old school type of movie that would have no originality i saw the this afternoon and i just cant believe how funny this movie was the great thing about it as absurd as the story is seriously its kind of realistic in some matter i mean who hasnt had a morning where they woke up from a night of drinking and just cannot remember one thing about the night before this is a comedy mystery story that just gets funnier with each scene that is played due to the strong cast great chemistry and a hilarious storydoug is about to be married so his friends stu phil and dougs soon to be brotherinlaw alan take him to las vegas for a bachelor party stus girlfriend is very controlling thereby forcing stu to lie to her about their destination the guys get a suite at their hotel then sneak on to the roof of the hotel and toast to the night ahead skipping forward to the next morning the three groomsmen awake with no memory of the previous night they find doug missing stu missing a tooth a tiger in the bathroom and a baby in the closet initially they believe doug to have gone out for breakfast but soon worry when his cell phone has been left behind they collect what memories they have to figure what happened to doug they go through the whole town of vegas discovering they messed with the chinese mafia mike tyson marrying a stripper and it just keeps getting weirder and weirderthis is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen i dont think ive laughed so hard consistently in a theater granted the movie has its flaws not everyone is going to fully get it or have the same sense of humor but just to see mike tyson jam out to phil collins in the air tonite is worth the ticket price alone i dont think there isnt going to be one person i dont recommend this movie too i think what did it for me was the cast they just had such great chemistry together and really made the movie work and took us with on this crazy story all the side characters were a great laugh too with heather graham as stus stripper wife and the chinese mafia leader leslie chow who has the biggest wtf moment with getting out of their car trunk naked and beating the heck out of the boys trust me you have to see this movie if you liked old school you will love the if you have ever had those mornings when you woke up and dont remember anything this is the movie for you910,comedy
not only did i think this movie was awful but most of my family did too we thought it was completely awful and didnt laugh once i even tried to force myself to laugh of funny theres a tiger in the hotel room wait thats not funny or is it but the odd thing about this movie is other people i know thought it was hilarious i watched it on my own so im confused about what parts others found funny i guess what this movie lacks for me is wittiness its more of scenic humor possibly i dont know how else to explain it because quite honestly im confused and just wish i hadnt watched it id like to hear someone that understands what makes people laugh explain why it is that this movie gets so many laughs from some but none from others,comedy
yes okay its very funny at times down right hilarious what sets this comedy apart from others of its ilk is a well structured script and a pace that doesnt allow any form of thinking the chemistry between the four leads is also a plus there is a surprising maybe unconscious touch of innocence in the midst of this night of debauchery that makes it palatable even charming bradley cooper is coming into his own and im absolutely certain that he was born to play emperor caligula in a future ridley scott flick the women as in most films about a bunch of heterosexuals doing childish things are treated appallingly they are the enemy that they have to protect themselves from or just escape run run as fast and as far as you can try to find the hooker with a heart of gold and if she looks like heathter graham that much better and forget about settling down the has already become the surprise hit of the summer 2009 i say well done it could have been worse,comedy
zach galifianakis ed helms and bradley cooper fall so perfectly into the circumstances of a night out without the wifegirlfrienda bachelor party no lessthat were all happy were safe in the audience clucking our tongues but secretly envying every single moment one that includes the ever watchable heather graham these boys fall and fall hard and trying to pick up the pieces of a night they strangely cant remember brought more laughs than the last time i laughed this consistently that was theres something about marythe cast never forgets that they are actors here and not on an episode of jackass as apatows comedies often feel theres tight control on the dialog and we never descend into simple slapstick oh theres broad humor but were watching terrific actors in very broad situations the trailer is a perfect sample of what youre going to get although it may veer into raunch perhaps a little more than the trailer hints but its never just sensationalism because i canregrettably i confessrelate to waking up in a room with a chicken and not knowing exactly from whence it camegalifiankis has the most unique character well besides a naked chinese fellow but you can discover that one for yourself and hes wonderful to watch not everything he does comes off 100 but when he scores its so far out from our own comfort zone that when the jaws of the other characters drop were right there with them rachel harris deserves special mention as the girlfriend who demonstrates why marriage can be so fearfulthis is as tidy a script as my best friends wedding and just as beautifully shot the cinematography could be pulled from any of the las vegas chamber of commerce ads and it only adds to our confidence that whatever is coming around the next corner we dont have to worry that it will wreck all thats gone before the makers of this little gem are as much in control as the characters are out of control and it was joy to finally get a great farce that were very sorry to see end i see that 2 is in development and i hope lighting strikes twicethe standard for wedding singer has been set anyone want to top this,comedy
when movies get billed as the comedy of the year the blockbuster everybody is talking about well i tend to walk to the other way and i wish had sticked to that plan before deciding to watch this complete crapso heres the setup husband to be two buddies and the brides brother get together for an overnight in vegasfriend one  school teacher and lowlife rips is class off to pay for vegas trip not a good startfriend two  henpecked doctor dentist lives in permanent denial of his girlfriends infidelity and unhappy relationshipbrides brother  dysfunctional family idiot quite plausiblegroom  a motherinlaws wet dream yawnso here we are four different but evidently three close friends and the idiot set off to vegas in fatherinlaw to be prized mercedesbenzwhat happens over the ensuing 24 hours is quite honestly woeful predictable and not funny  at allthe problem i think is that the three characters that are supposed to carry the film just dont work there not interesting or funny in any situation they find themselves in not once  everat one point the idiot turns into rainman and wins big  oh no didnt see that comingyawn againvery formulaic unfunny crap  and hollywood thinks we need more of this be warned stay away and spend your money more wisely,comedy
i dont find the dumb guy shtick funny anymore if i want to see guys portrayed like complete buffoons all i have to do is watch television commercials and sitcoms all day its getting old and played out especially because the apatow clan and similar movies have covered this ground over and over the past few years this movie just threw a bunch of random crap at the screen to see if it would stick and people would laugh i guess they did look at the high imdb rating i know that happens with new movies and the rating will go down over time but come onhow many times have we seen the get so wasted in vegas and wake up married the next day not remembering how it happened thing even the recent what happens in vegas with cameron diaz and ashton kutcher was a lot better than this which proves im not some analretentive humorless guy who forgot how to laugh or cant enjoy stupid movies the clichs in are endless and the humor predictablethe ridiculous plot holes dont help theres nothing wrong with absurd moments in comedies that arent believable to get some laughs but come on personally i need some connection to reality to get a laugh a tiger in the hotel room and then the guy walking in the room to hand the tiger a steak instead of just throwing it in room and quickly leaving totally predictable although it was good to see the mike tyson cameo they totally wasted it with more random nonsense it doesnt help that hes a terrible actorheather graham who i used to love continues to throw her career in the effin garbage although her mere presence helped at least well seeing that this move got high marks from a lot of people well be stuck with this bs for awhile no one is forcing me to see them true but even in decent movies theres always at least one dumb guy character im tired of it i cant watch one more dumb guy enough already,comedy
in my opinion is overrated i voted 1 one for this movie hoping to lower a bit the 8something rating i didnt pay to see it it was almost free on the internet maybe its not as bad as many of the new movies from hollywood but no way this is a top 250 movies all the time i was expecting in many situations that the story will get more complicated but instead it was another dot on the linear path of the story last 20 minutes were completely out of fun or suspense so overall not a good story no such act or quote to remember many will say its just a comedy dont look too hard its a movie for watching at home during weekend not demanding to understand just fun and relaxing i will reply to them  i hate that kind of movies,comedy
we got a single halfchuckle out of this movie at the 32 minute mark that was it for the entire movie we stuck it out to the bitter end only because so many people at the rental store said this was a very funny movie thanks to a couple of beers on hand i didnt die of complete boredom but we should have listened to the minority who said they turned it off after a few minutesthis movie contains trivial unfunny humor including lame butt jokes the acting is ponderous and uninspired largely because the content is completely lame and due to the need to drag this movie out to featurelength i could write funnier material than this if it was my jobcasting was also terrible for instance the fat jesus character just wasnt crazy or ugly enoughthe sleeping with the bartender joke was lame the first time we didnt need it repeated 10 more times same with the dr dentist jokethe portrayal of police officers and the physician as unprofessional was too uninspired to be funnythe movie is chockablock full of 4letter words and unimaginative insults yet every so often it throws in a kiddie swear word for no reason at all stupid on all countswhy did dr dentist ever think hed get away with staying in las vegas when his girlfriend checks his credit card statements and he was billing the hotel room to his credit card it wouldnt matter if the bill was for 100 or 10000 she would still see it was in las vegas not napanever answered howwhy did these deadbeats meet mike tyson and how did mike tysons tiger ever get to the hoteleven the makeup was bad doug should have much redder and his color was inconsistent between scenes at the end,comedy
i just joined imdb to trash this movie thats how much i didnt like it now i found superbad 40 yr old virgin something about mary animal house all hilarious moviesnot opposed to gross humor is my point but this movie was completely humorless had no soul each character more deplorable than the last what makes movies funny is often the tension between the wellintentioned good character and the rogues who beset them think ben stillers character vs matt dillons in sam nothing like that here really the character who might have brought comic tension into the story was the one roasting on the roof offcamera for 95 of the timedull dull dull,comedy
absolutely loved this movie the theatre was all laughs through the whole movie dont go expecting a cinematic masterpiece but if you are looking for out of control laughter this is your flick the story was funny the acting was hilarious and i dont want to spoil it but the end was so funny my wife hurt her ribs no im not kidding from laughing so hard i am going back to see this movie again and i dont do that often but for any guy with a sense of humour or has ever been to a bachelor party or cant wait to go to a rockin bachelor party this is a must see movie,comedy
this movie was absolutely amazing its really difficult to sit in the seat during the course of the movie the movie is a nonstop comedy and i fell of the seat 3 times during the course of the movie and absolutely lost all of my energy laughing through the movie for all those who want to see an absolute comedy movie this movie is for you d dthe role played by bradley cooper was really good the scene where he humps the tiger was really funnyzach galifianakis was really hilarious during the movie he was totally out of the world d,comedy
i thought that the started out pretty much along the same lines as your bogstandard grooms last night in vegas before the wedding scenario  with the same formula of a group of lads comprising of cool guys and oddballs  i wasnt therefore expecting too much out of the ordinary  i was pleasantly surprised however and i thought that the extra humorous original touches and the cast or relative unknowns used were above the average for this type of film  and it was genuinely funny in places basically an oddball mix of guys attend a stag do in vegas just before the grooms wedding  events happen and the group wake up  realising that they have no recollection of the previous night and that they have lost the groom  a very comic autopsy then ensues into what happened the night before and to retrace their steps to find out what happened  to try to get the groom to the altar on time  each time they discover a little more of what happened  they find themselves getting deeper and deeper into trouble there was also an interesting cameo role played by a wellknown personality that added to the humour  giving it quite a twist  the film just gets funnier as it goes along  it would also be wise to stick around to watch the credits at the end as there are some very amusing pictures of the events of the stag night  dont miss them ,comedy
this film is without doubt the funniest film i have seen in my 28 years of existence i have found most comedies over the last couple of years to be extremely overrated especially seth rogen movies and i did start to worry that i didnt have a sense of humour but this film proves that i was right and all the other comedies that have been made recently were wrong the casting is absolutely spot on and i couldnt fault a single performance highly recommended and i believe for the first time in my life i shall be willing to endure another the ending was also very clever and left audiences in the theatre cheering and clapping at the final credits,comedy
if theres a film that will be sold on word of mouth alone this summer its the with a funny but unspectacular trailer a plot guys go to vegas for bachelor party and crazy things happens that seems overly familiar and stars who are relative unknowns theres nothing to suggest anything hugely promising but those who have seen it can surely testify that its a 24carat piece of comedy gold for once you can believe the marketing mogulswe have been graced by the sleeper comedy hit of the summer on closer inspection it shouldnt actually have been that surprising todd phillips occupies the directors chair and his previous output includes such hits as road trip old school and starsky and hutch the though easily surpasses those by merit of providing regular and consistent laughs amidst backdrop of a frenetic and unrelenting morning afterthe problems most comedies face are that they have to put all their best laughs in the trailer so by the time the film comes around the funniest parts lose their impact and the rest of the film is disappointing in comparison this is a problem the sidesteps masterfully yes we know they wake up with no memory of what went before theres a baby a tiger a chicken a missing tooth someones married a hooker and in an unsurprisingly bizarre cameo mike tyson turns upbut these moments albeit hilarious arent what make the film tick the heart of the film is in the chemistry between the three leads phil bradley cooper stu ed helms and alan zach galifianakis are likable and identifiable enough for an audience to go along with events that could quite easily in another context seem ridiculous alan in particular is a character that could really grind your gears if he turned up in certain films as part of the affable trio however he grows on you immenselythis success may partly be credited to casting unfamiliar faces but the actors themselves deserve huge credit cooper may already be slightly familiar to some and is undoubtedly a star in the making having been cast this week as faceman in the new a team flick helms is best known for his stint in the us version of the office galifianakis though has come completely out of the blue and it wouldnt be at all a surprise to see him follow a career path similar to seth rogens post knocked up the missing groom doug justin bartha also deserves an honourable mention for slotting effortlessly into the group when around its a shame the plot requires him to go missing for the most part theres also perfectly pitched cameos for heather graham jeffrey tambor ken jeong and best of all rachael harris who is magnificently vile as the hapless stus wifephillips has no qualms puts his characters through the wringer theres one shocking revelation after another as the people animals and events they encountered the night before come back to bite them on the ass during the search for doug as the audience know as little as the characters do the reactions ring true they suspend disbelief as colossally silly events are only matched in magnitude by the sound of laughs in the theatre the never quite lets up  the laughs even continue way into the credits  so it should come as no surprise that a sequel is already being planned having come up with something so fresh here the producers will have to be careful not to suffer from a themselves the second time aroundverdict brilliant chemistry and a few plot tweaks make the better than you could possibly be expecting going in its funny from start to finish and is guaranteed to have you leaving the cinema with a smile on your face,comedy
lately after being disappointed a lot by trusting imdb ratings and comments too much and to discover that actual movie is total crap i know for sure that the movie industry itself hires people to comment positively on movies people who give this movie a 10 on 10 come on or i should be worried by society at this point laughing at people getting shot kicked or otherwise molested or this a totally manipulated rating i suspect my last suggestion and according to the normal reviews i have read i am not the only one this movie is not funny the only laugh i could bring up is a laugh about how idiotically not funny this movie is while being categorized as funny this has been the last time i trust imdb ratings marketing oriented thinking makes its logic that the movie industry itself manipulates ratings whilst this is a powerful tool to promote a movie i will however give movies now a chance with a bad rating because i suspect this indicates only that the movie producers are not s desperate to manipulate the movies rating imdb is turned into a total fake,comedy
after seeing the movie i was so unimpressed i felt like writing an ironic review praising the fine acting and exquisite plot in this film however since its currently in the imdb top 250 and number one in the us box office being a bit more serious seems like a better choice since i think the irony probably would be lost on most peoplethe is about four guys who go to las vegas to attend one of the guys bachelor party they have a wild night and wake up the next morning not being able to remember a single thing from the previous night this setup could possibly make for a somewhat entertaining film however they have failed on this one out of the running time i think i laughed about two times its a very excruciating thing to watch a film where even one joke falls flat in this one which is supposed to be a comedy they turn into string combos of jokes that simply arent funnythe humor is crude sexist violent and still without going ever going over the line which is a problem comedies that go over the line like borat for example really is my cup of tea but the never really dares to venture there for example you are supposed to think the fat guy is funny because he is weird and stupid although he comes off as too pathetic for it to be funnythe plot never draws you in since one does not feel anything for the main characters they are all unlikeable in their own unique way in movies its important to have a logical thread going through the entire film and not introduce too many random characters or events that are not motivated especially not in the later half or so in the way too many characters and situations are just randomly inserted which i suppose is meant to be goofy and hilarious but it just comes off as bad scriptwritingworst of all though and what really puts me off in the is the glorified picture of las vegas it produces which unfortunately is very common in the mass media today las vegas appears to be a paradise on earth where you come to have fun win lots of money and still leave with a smile on your face no matter what happens because what happens in vegas stays in vegas well let me tell you something ive been to las vegas never in my life have i been to a more horrid place i would never ever want to go there again to me las vegas really embodies all the bad parts of the american culture nothing feels real there its all about surface and everything has this plastic artificial feeling to it commerce is what its all about there spend money or lose it by gambling none of this matters though because most of the average joes watching this film will never go there so film makers can continue to picture las vegas in this almost mythological way,comedy
the  marmite love or hate by the looks of the reviewsi dont get the fuss everyone was raving about saying it was hilarious me and my boyfriend watched it and meh i get the plot a little overdone in tvfilmbooks but ok lets run with it the funny bits were so clich  tiger in your bathroom  opening door on head  funny asian guy  finding a baby  losing your friend  marrying a hooker  special relative  etcetcand i got to the stage where i could spot the catchphrases the film was hoping would catch on  wolf pack  you gonna f with me   chinese nuts   even stealing  what you talking bout willis   etcetcit was also seriously predictable knowing they wont remember anything after the drink  losing the groom  the sensible guy getting in most trouble and lying to his gf then eventually leaving  the hostage guy not being the right man  they get back to the wedding just in time blah blah zzzzzzzand the ending  oh i remember hes on the roof  whistle and go back to the roof where he is  an anti climax that almost made me angry it was so poorly and effortlessly writtenthis movie was also full of little flaws and i dont mean imdb users going anal on spotting the directors elbow in a shot i mean obvious stuff  finding a baby in your hotel room and taking it out with you  woulndt be calling the police no   a police car in a valet and being handed over to the guys without any checking who they are  a tiger being knocked out by a date rape drug  which as shown by the guys makes you forget not pass out   the police using the guys as a taser example infront of kids letting kids use tasers  i guess this is supposed to be a funny bit  its not  it is hard to enjoy the movie and look past these things its just distracting from the storyline  which was clich wait maybe that was a good thing then i thought this movie was rubbish i stayed awake in it but only because i was waiting to laugh for that reason ill give it a generous 4am going to watch the 2 now  i have been told it is funnier   i can believe that it is not hard to be funnier than the 1,comedy
pretty much every joke lands perfectly few movies still make me laugh every time i watch them and this is one of them,comedy
its not often that i start out laughing hysterically and then wish i had not bothered wasting two hours on a movie but that is exactly what happened for me with the the basic notion of the movie had so much promise when the gang wakes up in their incredible hotel suite at noon after the night of all nights before with the groom missing a full grown tiger in the bathroom a crying baby in the closet evidence that one of the groomsmen got married to a prostitute body piercing missing teeth a mattress from the hotel room on top of one of the ceasars palace statues and absolutely no memory of how any of this happened i thought we were in for one hell of a movie oh how wrong could i have been everything went down hill from here the implausible valet parked stolen police car the baby sat normally in the back of the police car with a regular seat belt whilst the gang mounts the vegas sidewalk at speed just to get out of traffic the gangsters with guns who do little more than threaten verbally the ridiculous ongoing escapades with mike tysons pet tiger the mit blackjack team impersonation from just 15 minutes reading a book on card counting that conveniently results in winning 82000 to pay back a debt of 80000 the police tazar gun demo on the gang by the local cops in front of participating school children and the middrive interstate delivery of tuxedos that conveniently fit perfectly i really wish someone would redo this movie and take the initial premise and make it darker and believable im amazed that the ratings are so high for what i feel was one of the worst movies of the year if not the decade,comedy
obviously the movie built a great deal on the classic viva ned flanders episode of the simpsons season 10 in 1999 which is not mentioned elsewhere the matching in the storyline is significant in simpsons homer takes ned flanders to las vegas to start enjoying life major points where the two pieces meet are the scene casinos and the in las vegas the appearance of a tiger tyson getting married to a casino employee and so on  all must be a miraculous coincidencethe clearly has some great jokes but it cannot keep up the same level throughout the 100 minutes therefore the moderate rating i recommend to watch it just to cheer up but without very high expectations,comedy
im not above juvenile humor the 40 year old virgin and forgetting sarah marshall were at times tasteless often juvenile and hilarious knocked up less so but with more heart wedding crashers was laugh out loud funny a lot of the time as it continue to go way too fari laughed maybemaybe three times at most during this movie including the supposedly laugh so hard sequence during the credits the characters are unlikeable the plot is basically dude wheres my car in vegas and the jokes fall way flat that several notable critics think this movie is great either means that i havent had nearly enough drunken misadventures to relate to this film or that there is a stupid pandemic in this country that puts swine flu to shamefor anyone who hasnt seen this movie yet and is unsure whether to trust the negative reviews or the positive reviews i say this find someone who has seen this movie whose opinion on movies you almost always agree with if they say youll like it go and see it and join in with the stupids who find this rehashed tripe hilarious if youre going based on hype you may end up as disappointed as i wasoh and btw theres no way this movie belongs anywhere near the top 250 of all time its not in the top 250 of this decade though its solidly in the top 10 of worst movies ive ever paid to see,comedy
this movie is hands down the raunchiest and one of the funniest movies i have ever seen from the beginning of the movie right up to the end it is consistently funny there really are not any slow parts to this movie because they are on a constant journey and race against time and just when you thought the movie couldnt get any funnier the last 30 seconds of the movie slaps you across the face i literally was laughing so hard i cried i walked out of the theater feeling hungover from an overdose of laughter great time nothing more to say spend the money to see this and you wont regret it,comedy
its happened again the is another film produced this century that has a premise thats almost identical to an older movie the  dude wheres my car 17 again  big 13 going on 30 freaky friday tropic thunder  the three amigos the devil wears prada  how to lose friends and alieniate people the version of dwp thats written by a man about a man surfs up  cars surfs up was way better thoughanywayim dumbstrcuk by how much praise this movie is receiving its got no originality the plot is ludicrous and boring and most of it still doesnt make any sense some of its jokes include a backless jock strap a man peeing while he turns to look at a tiger which happens to be mike tysons that they stole from his house makes no sense for two reasons a they somehow find and walk right into mikes house b they take this tiger up to their room without anyone noticing a naked chinese man beating the crap out of them and the unexplained rooster wandering the hotel roomit did have its funny moments but numbed my bottom thoroughly as they say avoid this movie unless you havent seen dude wheres my car its what dude wheres my car would have looked like if it was created for an older crowd,comedy
this movie being rated with a similar rating as such a great films as some like it hot dr strangelove and annie hall shocks meso generic i find nothing funny about the same old gag trick of someone suddenly vomiting which didnt look real but i dont care a car being trashed people beaten up cars trashed more more beatings slapstick gags breast shots genital shots and ugly fat asses and more vomitingcertainly the writer or whoever wanted to use shock effect since most people nowadays have seen so much and heard so much that they have to go quite far to shock but this was sooo cheap and low grade a few others here have mentioned this as well and i really wish i had read their comments but they were too far down the chain of praise for this stupidity i only read the main comment that the imdb gang has posted as the representative comment not to slam imdb its a terrific site and ive used it for years but there needs to be a balance so that people like myself dont get sucked into shelling out my hardearned money to be dragged through this trashit starts right off with insipid rehashed foolishhighschoolkid type pranks which drones on to the very end and that weird pedophile what humor does anyone find in a pedophile do most people nowadays think its funny or maybe it went over their heads i dont know then the poor little baby was obviously frightened on purpose to get him to cry just that alone was upsetting mei did laugh in a couple of places but that was after id already been sitting there for half an hour kicking myself that id actually paid to watch this garbage and that short interval of ha ha didnt make up for the rest of the film which leans heavily on the abovementioned cheap lowgrade slutville humor,comedy
warning spoiler the movie kept on ranting about how crazy they were at the hospital or at the wedding chapel and all the other events that happened the night before why couldnt they have shot three or four more quick flashback montages for each one so we could be in on the fun like they did with the mike tyson security camera this would have made it a much better movie the ground work was there it was fun but they fell short on delivery cant rely on a dozen or so snapshots at end to tie it up and satisfy the audience it seems they all put on the makeup for the photos had some kind of location and someone forgot the film camera and so they couldnt shoot it live so they took photos instead disappointed with lack of vision on whoever made that call also a little anticlimatic with finding friend they were searching for entire movie payoff dismal for all that set up and again no flashback of how it actually went down showing us the event,comedy
i didnt have very high expectations just because these kind of madeforfraternity movies arent usually appealing to me in that regard it was what i expected not clever at all there really werent any jokes i mean you pretty much know that the movie is going to be about a terrible and it is  but there arent any very clever jokes solid characters or interesting situations where something funny might happen instead the writers take the easy route but not a very funny one and all of the attempted humor is just pure shockvalue it just doesnt meet my definition for what a good comedy or good movie should be at all i kept waiting to laugh but never did i would not recommend this film to anyone its all hype and marketing and does not deliver,comedy
wow this is just the worst movie i have ever seen everything failed and i did not even smile once it was so full of clichs bad actors and overthetop bs that i was tempted to exit the cinema for the first time in my life i would have if i didnt go there with friendsits predictable boring and a complete waste of time the actors overact almost every scene and some of them are embarrassing to watch i particularly disliked the guy who was always being an asshole towards the others as he seemed to be a complete douche and a waste of air the guy named alan was overacting in a way that is hard to describe the one with glasses was boring and dull and the last one we didnt really see that much which i am grateful forthis is just dickhumor and a bad attempt at that even this movie is a waste of money and everybody involved deserves some sort of torture directed towards their lower regioni am in shock even things like epic movie is better than this,comedy
humorous movie in every aspecti watched the movie at a preview screening at ubc so the audience were all college students everyone i talked to so far had loved this moviethe tale of how three friends tries to find the lost groom before his wedding after their crazy night in las vegas the movie gets funny from the las vegas part right till the end there is hilarious stuff in every other scene not to be missed one of the best comedy of 2009the entrance of chinese goon is hilarious will have you in splits they have touched on all types of jokes especially the minor mention of the different sex gay interracial beastiality the only movie that i can think of that is relatively similar is harold  kumar i recommend everyone to watch it not for kids you wont regret it,comedy
wow now i know why theyre making a second part of the movie when it wasnt released yet thee best comedy movie this year for sure i dont think i can stop watching it the movie starts when they start the experience when they did i knew i am about to have some good time the funny scenes are infinite the masturbating baby the chinese lucky charm tiger tyson and aleen is the king fav comedy movie after tropic thunder i think that in the next part they gonna have to do a much harder working since they rose the bar so high in this part i really dont think that they should remove or add any people to the 4 guys because theyre already hilarious cant wait for the second part,comedy
the is the work of todd phillips you know him he made road trip he also made old school getting a bunch of buddies together and throwing in sex drugs beer and all kinds of fratboy hijinx is a formula thats served him well in the past and it does the same here at the outset the movie is simple one wild night followed by a couple days of trying to figure out what happened its a buddy comedy and mystery reminiscent of dude wheres my car except this movie happens to be funnythe cast is mostly unknown but phillips has worked with that before comedy is about chemistry not big stars commanding big paychecks bradley cooper last seen in hes just not that into you ed helms the daily show and zach galifianakis idk this play phil stew and alan three guys taking their buddy doug justin bartha out to vegas for his bachelor party phil and stew are the best buddies alan is dougs mentallyaskew soontobebrother inlaw after a wild night the three guys wake up the next day to a trashed hotel room and several odd unexplained phenoms they find a baby in the closet a tiger in the bathroom and doug is nowhere to be found other mysteries include why did stew marry a stripper heather graham why are asian mobsters after them and dude wheres the car the guys must retrace their steps to figure out the night and also find dougfresh surprises keep coming as the story moves along some like the baby and the marriage to the stripper are missed opportunities but for the most part theyre pretty hilarious the tiger is a great bit as are the asian mobsters what happens to be lying in the trunk of the car is another good one what powers it all is that the guys remember nothing of the night before the movie is like a fishoutof water tale just replace the water with jagermeister and roofies phillips ties it all together with crude laughs that nonetheless come off very funny masturbation sex drugs stunguns fwords condoms and a couple of baby gags that im pretty sure will cement his place in hell but still make people laugh pretty hard are just a few things in his comic arsenalthe three guys are great together allan is awkwardly clueless unpredictable and a little crazy his speech inviting the guys into his wolf pack of one is fantastic as is what comes after that the chubby and fullybearded zach galifianakis is a scene stealer stew is the opposite a guy so whipped into submission by his girlfriend that they might as well share brains hes a nervous nerd prone to unraveling at the first sign of pressure and phil is the cool clearheaded straightman to the other two who get most of the laughs cooper helms and galifianakis know their roles well and convince that these three very different guys could actually be friends the supporting cast which includes rob riggle rachel harris mike epps and mike tyson in a very funny cameo help out as well but the best one comes from ken jeong playing mr chow leader of the asian mob his flamboyance and exaggerated speech make him a ridiculously quirky villainthe is a comic adventure well worth taking and when it finishes dont leave yet cause youll miss the hilarious trip photos playing over the closing credits the movie is fresh lively fastpaced and the cast is all game drink it up its a lot of fun,comedy
considering the hype and 4 star reviews i went to this movie hoping for something more then a remake of swingers and more adult then the endless juvenile were going to swear and talk about gay things to shock the audience movies that seem to be prolific at the moment  i can honestly say i didnt smile once during the whole movie  and i loved swingers getting embarrassed over a breast feeding mother and an elderly patients butt  oh please hollywood needs to grow up  they were making movies like this when i was in my teens porkys  get your noses out of your school boy fantasies and try and make a decent movie next time will you something with a little wit and intelligence if you dont mind,comedy
this is just another stupid american comedy i know this is ratedr for nudity and sexual content not for the kids but also this should not be for anyone shooting stun gun to grown ups was not funny at all especially by some field trip students making 82000 from black jack was so unreal are people out of their mind to give high score for this kind of junk movie i waste my dollars on trash and whats wrong with people i sort of trusted this imdb score setup by people normal people maybe i was wrong there are some exceptions i guess there should be a new rating level for this kind of movies iq70 whoever has iq lower than 70 can watch this kind of movies how about that,comedy
you know how sometimes a films buzz can be so loud that your high expectations are undermined by mindless drek is not one of those films brilliantly paced the laughs were in almost every bizarre development and the actors were so superb that every absurd twist and nearly every line seemed natural a few sequences were exceptionally worthwhile  the first morning after events set up the rest of the film with outrageous sight gags that suggested epic debauchery without revealing too much too soon stay through the credits for a big payoff youll laugh until you hiccup and then after you catch your breath youll laugh even harder in fact i may need a comedy intervention,comedy
it is about time that we see bradley cooper as a leading man he has performed so well in comedies like wet hot american summer wedding crashers and last years yes man with jim carrey on the other hand his costars of ed helms and zach galifianakis perform better than most of the familiar comedy genre faces this movie was already held with high expectations before it was released but those expectations have truly been met and surpassed altogether now at first i was hesitant because the whole rated r gross out comedy style is getting recycled way too much lately but this actually turned out to be a hilarious movie with nothing seeming like it was recycled from judd apatow adam sandler or kevin smith movies the cast actually is made up of people that normally have to take the backseat as cameo people or supporting people and they truly deliver and showcase why they need to lead more often in films all in all you really get what you expect and more from the the characters are likable the story is something new and different plus you get a lot of laughs that dont seem like they have been stolen from the apatowsandler movies this is truly the breakout comedy of the summer and probably one of the funniest movies of the year 20091010,comedy
sometimes the title of a film can sell itself or at the very least pique a viewers interest director todd phillips new comedy the does this and more by introducing an infinitely relatable premise and infusing it with a clever story to keeps the gimmick supported for the duration while providing the requisite raunch stupidity and laughs the is bolstered more by its puzzle piece narrative then by straight up humour the mark of a good comedy is one that can keep your interest in between the laughs be it by human drama character development or in this case a meandering riddlewhat do we really know about a we know we have one and we know we drank too much often everything before after and inbetween can be a blur at best and for three friends phil stu and alan they certainly got the worst travelling to las vegas for a night of sin gin and wins to celebrate their friend dougs justin bartha bachelor party they awaken the next morning to find their hotel room a tad dishevelled a tiger in their bathroom their memories wiped clean and their groom to be mia playing the three worried bros respectively are bradley cooper as the boredwithhislife school teacher ed helms as the neurotic dentist and zach galifanakis as the awkward weirdo and soon to be brother in law of doug so unfolds the mystery trying to find their missing friend before the wedding by piecing together the clues of their epic night outfor me the standout of the group was certainly ed helms he plays the role straight he is likable and he is funny his characters arc is the most complete and entertaining and he certainly grounds his wilder counterparts nicely the other players are certainly funny yet the characters of phil and alan are not fully likable coopers phil is a bit of a prick and alan is flat out creepy that aside the actors put forward such commendable efforts all is soon forgotten and the quick pace and continual humour keeps things fast fun and franticas promised by the trailers we get a cameo from the mike tyson who is funnier for being himself then for his actual performance darting in an out with a great supporting performance is heather graham as an escort and mike epps makes good use of his time as quote black doug more hilarious yet is a closing cover for rapper 50 cents candy shop which is as inspired as it is hilarious the is certainly one of those comedies that is rewatchable and likely to improve with repeat viewings however it is probably a good thing actual s are not this much fun id rather die of laughter then alcohol poisoningread all my reviews at simonsaysmoviesblogspotcom,comedy
after hearing all of the hype about this movie i couldnt wait to see it to hear a movie being touted as the best reviewed comedy of the year i was expecting a whole lot more than what i got i have actually watched this movie more than once to see if maybe i had just missed something i will admit there were a few funny moments but when i hear people say they laughed through the whole movie it truly confuses me i like to think of myself as someone who definitely has a great sense of humor and i truly appreciate many forms of comedy i loved old school also by todd phillips but i dont see that this movie can even hold a candle to that flick i found ed helms acting to be horrible and i actually found his character annoying many of the jokes just fell flat i really wanted to love this movie but that is not the case its not all bad just not what i was hoping for,comedy
i have just had the dubious pleasure of watching the hanover a film that was recommended to me by virtually all of my work colleagues let me start by saying  this is the first time that i have written a comment on imdb a website that i use as the bible of movie going notice i use the word comment and not review basically because there is nothing to review here this has to be the worst comedy that i have ever seen please avoid at all costs  i am only giving it one star because i think that mike tysons performance is worthy of some praise i really cant see why this is film is so popular  i thought i was sitting down to watch another sideways instead i witnessed 2 hours of mindless rubbish  i appreciate this will not be a popular view but there are times when one feels compelled to speak out against the mainstream finally if there is anyone out there that hasnt seen this movie my advice would be to watch  burn after reading  instead  the funniest black comedy of the year ,comedy
as a long standing admirer of movies and acting i do enjoy my comedies as the doctors say laughter is the best medicine sure the face of comedy has changed from the sophisticated seventies of annie hall but that isnt a bad thing eitherwhich brings me to the brocom or bromance as i prefer weve seen its early stages from road trip old school anchorman the 40yearold virgin and blooming into gems such as role models i love you man  now the classic god i still cant stop laughing as im writing thisand before you ask i have seen this film 6 times already and aim to watch it even more upon its dvd release sometime in october lucky guess i thinkfrom the posts ive read on this thread i would agree with some opinions such as the fact that the is sex and the city for men  but funny it proves again that when a bunch of guys get together as wonderfully illustrated in this film that theyre not leering at women from afar in benny hill fashion but paying them cheeky compliments along the way excuse me maam in the leopard dress you have an amazing rack says bradley coopers phil wenneck on a megaphone i wont recap the scenario for you as i am sure 95 of the usa has seen this already oh and dont get me started on dweebs who say that the tiger in the backseat is unreal  its a comedy for crying out loud its the same with stu price confronting the tiger in the bathroom and screaming like a girl when giving him his raw meat the laughter wouldve been lost if he simply threw the morsel at the animalwhy i embrace the bromance so much is that it outlines womens faults as much as ours in i love you man rashida joness zoe thinks its fine for her to gossip with girlfriends about her sex life with peter klaven paul rudd but he cant behave in the same manner with his male pals the same goes for ed helmss stu price and the fact that his antichrist girlfriend wont let him have a lads weekend away but its okay for her to sleep with a bartender it also illustrates americas constant homophobia issues and luckily its acceptable for straight men to declare their brotherly love without worrying about waking up in bed together what grates on my nerves are people who express their disapproval about socalled gay bashing in this and other movies such as the 40yearold virgin this is comedy after all and you cannot be politically correct to please your demographic audience thats just plain silly lines such as paging doctor faggot are simply hilarious because its mocking that characters stupidity not making fun of homosexuals if youre gay and want to be offended go and watch bruno with sacha baron cohen or beerfest where they do nothing but reinforce the stereotype if people start to nitpick about the flack racialreligioussexual groups receive from comedies then what will you eventually make fun of i am actually mixedrace myself and have never taken offence to a classic comedy where the majority of the players are white in fact i welcome these movies than drivel such as pooty tang  a thin line between love  hate 4710 on imdbs start rating oh and bad boys  unfunny shouting and self indulgentwhat makes the an instant classic is the casting  chemistry with all the leads and todd phillipss hilarious cameo bradley cooper whose character of zachary sack lodge in wedding crashers was such a douchebag but played the part to perfectionin other words he was unforgettable i was surprised at his casting initially but the man can play comedy very well and gets a few good laughs as i have mentioned already he seems like a standup guy in real life and look forward to seeing more of the coopster in the future ed helms is also phenomenal in his role as stu  and quite sympathetic at times as well dont know much about him but believe me i am a convert now and will be watching the office as soon as possible great comic timing and delivery doesnt hurt your appeal does it zach galifianakis i used to watch him in tru calling but had no idea he was so funny yes hes out of shape but that makes him more believable and his deadpan humour gives this movie some of its funniest moments  including the threat of not being afraid to beatup an old man at the gas station or the side effects of roofies is memory loss remember or the sidesplittingly hilarious i didnt know they gave out rings in the holocaust justin bartha as white doug he didnt have a lot to do in this film but as a testimony to visual comedy his red face in the end is something else  and pretty sure his on screen bridetobe couldnt keep a straight face either the thing i love about this comedy is that unlike sex and the city these guys have ordinary professions except for alan  doug whom we dont find anything about which makes it easier as an audience to bond with and best of all is the shared dynamic they all have also the fact that you miss comedic moments the first time means youll savour them on repeated viewing a great chemistry and a comedy that doesnt apologise when it comes down to using a baby for a jackoff joke lets hope 2 is as good as or surpasses this milestone classic todd phillips we salute you ps ken jeongwhat a legend and a great sport for understanding the values of being in a rrated comedy his so long gay boys line will forever be on my cellphone when the dvd is released,comedy
id seen i love you man the previous week and had hoped for something equally funny and enjoyablesadly the is weak lame unfunny poorly cast and really just a total waste of time personally id wait until its a weekly hire dvd and then be suspecthow it got to be 130 on the imdb top 250 really makes me reconsider using imdb ratings as a guide to moviegoing and question any newspaper critics who give it even faint praisethe fact we have to write a minimum 10 lines about this here is a further travesty of justice,comedy
as a 32 year old all american white male i should have thoroughly enjoyed this movie but not only did i not i really really hated it a low budget cast of unknown utterly uninteresting and completely unlikeable characters a juvenile mindless and just plain stupid storyline that apparently tried to put a slapstick comic spin on 1998s excellent very bad things you know the story a group guys go to las vegas for a bachelor party that turns into nightmare but this time the morons that made this movie threw in a gross fat guy a tiger and an annoying chinese bad guy oh and i cant forget a barely recognizable and very out of shape mike tyson the only think that would have redeemed this mess would have been if they all did a thelma and louise and drove off a cliff or in this case the hoover dam,comedy
my brotherinlaw who is in his mid 30s and who knows i love a good comedy handed this dvd to me and said here you need to watch this its the funniest movie ive ever seen i shouldve known then it was going to be awful considering in most cases his idea of humor is about the same as that of a 14 year old boy however i had heard others say how funny it was so i thought maybe why not for the record let me state that im a big fan of lowbrow humor i love the majority of the classic dirty comedies the is definitely not in that group however at one point i looked at my wife who also likes a good comedy and asked her if she wanted to watch something else her exact statement was maybe it will get funny not a good signthe first problem is that the characters are just not likable justin barthas character is probably the most likable and hes hardly in the film bradley coopers character is a massive jerk much like his role in the wedding crashers which is a much better movie than this one ed helms character is an irritating whiner and zach galifianakis character wasnt much better just stupid irritatingsecondly the movie tries too hard to be funny look a dentist pulled his own tooth out isnt that funny a tiger in a hotel room isnt that funny look the idiot is a genius blackjack player whew didnt see that one coming mike tyson wow that dude is funny right i could go on the supposed gags feel contrived and forcedfinally the dirty humor comes across as crass rather than funny animal house does dirty humor very well its funny the does not it gets the dirty part but misses the humorsave yourself two hours of your life and watch something else,comedy
saw preview at vue cinema thurrock 2609 this is without a doubt the funniest film i have seen in quiet a while to tell you anything about it would spoil the film but suffice to say that i thought my wife would need the toilet a few times during the film it has some uncomfortable tones it brings a whole new meaning to the expression never act with kids or animals which may upset some people and the overall effect is a whacking success the language is a bit rich at times but given the situations i think i might have sworn the actors are mainly unknown until now and that adds to the unpredictability of some of the funniest scenes in that there are no heroes or villains as such except no that would be going too far see the film and enjoymay god forgive me for laughing so much so would i buy the dvd most definitely cant wait,comedy
even thou the movie it self is pretty funny the plot is shameless ripoff of the dude wheres my car let me sum up both movies for you in order few friends wake up after a terrible hang overthey are missing something and trying to recreate what happened last nightthey run in to a wild animal and then interrogated by some mean copsone of them got a really hot chick even if he doesnt remember itthey run into some washed celebritythey then getting confronter by a gang of people for something they have but they dont remember where it isthen they realize that the thing they been looking for was close to them whole time and end up in better position then they were inendyeah thats both movies as said ripoff,comedy
when i first saw the trailer i thought there is another stupid comedy filled with generic humor but this movie was just amazing i was laughing during the whole thing usually there are five or six extremely funny moments in everyone of this kind of films but this was entirely new experience the plot is old the actors are well known but somehow the movie is just hilarious i am absolutely serious when i say that this is the best comedy i have ever seen everything in it is so unpredictable you just do not know what will be the next absurdly funny scene and they do not over do it something that is very very important because you would normally say to yourself when watching this kind of movies well that is just impossible or why am i watching this here instead you would say i just got to have one night like theirs and that is the thing that me and my friends said to each other after the film it is so unrealistic and at the same time so plausible in an unbelievable way that is what makes it so amazing extraordinary things happen to ordinary people my advice is to watch this movie because it will change your entire idea of what comedies should be,comedy
unless youre some smug pretentious uptight antisocial person that people dont like to hang out with youre gonna love this flick its hilarious off hand the group of guys going to vegas for a bachelor party doesnt sound enticing or something that could make for a great movie since its an epic retread in cinema but director todd phillips takes the idea and runs with itthe movie unlike most doesnt center around the bachelor party but the next day as the guys try and trace their way through the night and figure out what exactly happened the night before in a drunken hazethe flick plays like a whimsical drug induced detective story they chase leads confront many colorful characters and find themselves in and out of trouble while trying to piece together the pieces of the night before and locate their pal the groom who was lost along the waythe chemistry of these fellas is outstanding none of them miss a beat and theyre all funny of course the lesser known zach galifinakis really shines here as the not all there clingon soontobebrother in law of the groom none of his oneliners miss their target and the sheer sight of him puts a smile on our facesall in all a hilarious adventure that will keep you laughing throughout and this i promise you now go see it,comedy
the best way to see a good movie is to go into it knowing as little about it as you can so i try not to include details about the movies in my reviews if the movie sucks then im not shy about including details andor spoilersis it me or do you think the was overrated i mean the seemed overrated as hell all the funny parts to the can be found in the trailer was so unfunny that i didnt waste a dime on the sequel as for hall pass holy hell it is funny as almost as funny as old school laugh out loud funny it is everything that the shouldcould have been if you like off the wall and sick and twisted humor then youll love this movie they better make a sequel to this beast of a movie hall pass is what the should have been actually funnythe is a bit of a mystery to me in that i am confused why people liked it so much i personally know one person that thought this movie was great however he happened to be a 16 year old kid that never seen superbad or old school why did hollywood overhype this boring ass comedy maybe vagus paid them who knows,comedy
this film sucks and imdb is losing its credibility by showing this kind of titles on the top 250 list and curiously while they are still being shown on theaters according to the top 250 list this film is better than lock stock and two smoking barrels dont miss it and decide for yourself can we still believe in what we see on this site and now i have to write up to 10 lines of text so that it matches the minimum site comment length this is an embarrassing situation imdbcom owes its users an explanation for that im feeling a little weird i hope we wont discover in the following days some secret contract between this site and film producers is it long enough like that,comedy
rubbish seriouslya rubbish comedy this has been done so many times before so let me tell youi saw nothing original in the its the same american pie farrelly brothers jackass comedy americans have been churning out for the past 10 years a few laughs here and there but thats all the is one of those films that has been unneccessaryly hyped and the truth is theres nothing special about it four grown men frolicking in the las vegas desert has been to death and that was more or less the premise of the film i even think i fell a sleep a couple of times because some parts were so boring expect american directors and producers to churn out more of this trash in years to come unoriginal unfunny and an overrated comedy worst film of the year by far and this will probably my easiest review of the year,comedy
i thought this movie was total trash not funny at all just a bunch of stupid frat boy humor i was actually depressed watching it because it just goes to show you how low our society has sunk seems that hollywood has no limits anymore on how to make money off of sex drugs exploiting women and lack of caring for animals and children this is just mindless garbage the lead character bradley cooper is also extremely annoying he plays a dick in every show he is in and i have a hard time believing it is far from reality it is actually insulting to the general public that the majority of people that went to see this movie gave it such high ratings stupid and sad,comedy
the was hilarious i was never never bored and it was the funniest move i have ever seen the characters were hilarious and the actors were very well chosen for the part my favorite was the dude with the beard he was awesome the plot was also very interesting it always kept my attention and i was even nervous for the ending i have never heard so man funny and interesting comments in one movie i definitely recommend watching this movie i will for sure be buying it the day it comes out i recommend this movie to anyone who wants to laugh it was extremely hilarious and is great for anyone over the age of 13 go see this movie it was absolutely awesome,comedy
as everybody was saying that this movie is great i decided to check the rating on imdb uau 85 theres no chance i thought of getting bored at the theater so i didnt even blink when i suggested it to my friends on a friday night so sure i was about the real good time we would spend laughing our eyes out the movies begins and with it the first disappointment retrospective guided we saw the end when it had nearly began no suspense at all then nothing happenedjust a bunch of jerk offs doing stupid things and the worse no fun no laughs nobody laughed at all zero the only half fun scene was the one where the chicken appears behind someones head lying on the floor i honestly cant understand how someone enjoyed this movie and how is it possible to rate it with 10 absolutely ridiculous id rather watch the monster of black lagoon 10 times in a row than this one only once,comedy
the is the most overrated movie i have ever seen in my entire life all it is an overhyped overacted unoriginal piece of garbage it is a total rip off of dude wheres my car as a movie critic the was very insulting that the writers think the audience is actually that stupid but judging from most of other reviews of the 12they are that stupidthis shouldnt have even been released as anything more than a tv movie and even that should not have done this good the most successful r rated comedy ever made people need to stop watching movies drunk if they are going to review them because that movie spat in the face of comediestheir audiences and movies in general the movie is about a guy about to get married who goes to vegas with his friends and disappears then they all wake up hungover and dont remember what happened the night beforewhat is this like the 50th movie about hungover idiots who dont remember what happened the night before in the last couple yearsthe funny parts of the movie are so forced and most of it is just supposed to be shocking its like the writer of this movie just was drunk one night watching movies with his drunk friends and one of them said hey man youre funnyyou should write a comedy because that is literally what i was thinking while i was watching it a bunch of drunk idiots working on a movie with no real movie experience at allapes could do a better jobif their was any number lower than 110 to rate i would have rated it thatbut unfortunately there isnt so i have to rate it 110,comedy
i wasnt sure whether i really wanted to see this movie but after loads of pushing i saw this with my friends and i loved it the story is too good and the comedy along with the timing is awesome well it is all boys out comedy and i think every man on this earth would love watching this comedy all four main characters are well casted and the acting is superb the direction is cool too and most of the story and the screenplay one has to laud these factors  because along with the laughters it brings a strong story which grips the audience completely so grab ur best friends and have a bash with this film,comedy
saw this film last night and without a doubt this is the funniest film i have ever seen it by far exceeded my expectations as thought it was going to be a typical bloke film but from start to finish i was roaring upthere are many moments that are quite wrong and you feel slightly concerned that you are laughing so hardbaby at the table immediately springs to mindbut this is a very clever comedy no detail is spared and every cast member has been cast perfectlyi cant begin to recommend this film highly enoughgo see,comedy
a lot of excellent jokes throughout raunchy crude fun time well deserving of the oscar win that it received i originally saw it in theaters and used to own on it blu ray a while backits a great hit especially for fans of party flicksdumb comedies like myself there are a few things that rub me the wrong way however like the police brutality scene the stuff involving a baby  the constant meanness towards alan otherwise i love this movie,comedy
this one piles on the laughter it is irreverent wellwritten and despite it being a paid for advertisement is delightfully absurd you want more there is a hot sexy babe in it too what more could you wantthe writing here succeeds,comedy
dope trials that armstrong tested positive with were given to him by a mark of discredit because after six champions of the world he had to be discontinued from the race the in several scenes in life will be helpful to look at with a disconnected air about us,comedy
this was not on my list to watch until a friend from work mentioned it and told me that it was hilarious i got intrigued as i didnt really know the actors in it back then and i was surprised how funny the movie really was i really enjoyed it and had to see part 2 and 3 after it didnt disappoint this became one of my comedy faves highly recommend,comedy
i love this movie it was great i laughed my ass off,comedy
i switched this off after half an hour something i seldom doi started watching it because id heard so much about it i was determined that i would finish it but after 30 minutes of profanities and nothing in the least bit funny i pulled the plugive seen some dreadful movies in my time but this is near the bottom of the barrel,comedy
okayim still trying to figure out why everyone thought this movie was so funny because it wasnt at all harold  kumar go to white castle is funny american pie is funny animal house is funny national lampoons christmas vacation is funny monty python is funny this movie is not funny this movie drags on and on and on there are some funny parts but other than that its worthless its slow boring and uneventful the best thing this movie has to offer is the soundtrack the events that take place in this movie are completely unbelievable and just stupid dont rent this movieunless you have nothing better to do with your life,comedy
when i saw that imdb rating for this movie was 8210 i believed that this film didnt deserve such a rating i thought that 810 is too much for a comedy film when i saw the movie i was laughing all the time the perfect screenplay of jon lucas and scott moore had so many funny parts in this crazy story  smart humor and sexcomedies scenes were so funny todd philips did a great job in directing once again bradley cooper was a really weird school teacher  ed helms was the serious guy of the film zach galifianakis was the crazy character of this movie justin bartha  the lost guy very good acting from all of them  especially zach also a strong supporting cast like heather graham ken jeong jeffrey tambor rachael harris mike epps and of course the baby carlostyler was so funnynice job from everyone and  thank you for this amazing night in las vegas for one of the best ever comedies  1010 ,comedy
i questioned how good this would be since i first saw the trailer i had my doubts but everyone kept telling me how hysterical it was sure i chuckled once or twice but this was far from funny certainly nothing like old school or wedding crashers which is what everyone who raved about the film compared it to the funniest part of the entire film was when the credits rolled i dont mean that as an insult that part really was funny other than that i felt most of the jokes were flat cheap sight gags and very few witty linesid wait for this one on rental even then  its not that great should have listened to my gut after i first saw the trailer,comedy
this movie is just awful unoriginal derivative idiotic and a semiripoff of very bad things that was actually funny there is not one laugh in this film i am utterly shocked at the good reviews it stinks the flick is a very very very boring exposition of a few guys going to vegas and getting into trouble does this sound like very bad things or what there is no laughter in this film at all i am shocked that it made any money whatsoever rip off beware how on earth this movie got backing is way beyond me its an odor generating mess that isnt funny avaois at all costs you will hate yourself for renting or buying this atrocity stay away,comedy
i have trusted imdbs rating until now how a terrible movie like this can get a rating of 80 is unfathomable to me i seriously have never even smiled once during this movie how can anyone like this infantile movie is beyond me none of the characters are believable the story is just plain stupid it takes half an hour just to get the movie started seriously it took them 33 minutes to get to las vegas i would just like to ask the writer of this horse manure a few questions why is doug sitting on a roof for a whole day on the roof by himself it is truly one of the worst movies i have seen i think imdb should seriously look at their rating system there is something fishy when a crap like this can score over 80,comedy
this movie gets funnier as the story unfolds i havent seen a movie as funny as this in too many years 3 friends and the weird brother of the bride go to las vegas for a bachelor party when they wake up from a wild night on the strip there is a baby and a tiger in their spectacular suite at cesaers palace phil has a hospital name band on stu the dentist has lost a tooth and a valuable heirloom alan has lost his underwear if that is what you call what he wears under his pants and they have all lost the groom doug the escapades to find doug are over the top hilarious as they retrace their steps through events and people they find out happened and it just gets funnier the ending credits are a must watch too from start to finish there is never a nonlaugh moment a peeinyourpants movie a must see movie,comedy

a few helpful suggestions for how to make a movie as successful as the 1 dont make your characters likable instead make them annoying selfish and petty2 dont be afraid to indulge in a little sexism the is a movie for the guys and many guys secretly harbor low opinions of the women they date marry or otherwise know provide some female characters who can confirm these opinions an annoying harridan of a fiance a stripper etc3 dont be afraid of a little racism either if all your stars are white you can expect your audience to be white so its okay to show off some stereotypes of asians and latinos in your film4 dont make it funny this is the most important one rather than clever jokes or memorable slapstick routines provide your viewers with painful gags obvious oneliners and grating sarcasm while generally soaking your film with a feeling of negativity abuse your characters actors and audience as much as possible you will only hurt them because you love them so much,comedy
this is the worst movie i have ever seen i do not suggest it for anybody who did not watch this movie yet just be sure that you did not miss anything this movie is just a wasting of money characters are totally out of control and i do not think they are good models for youths so there should be also age limit for the movie in addition i could not find any useful subject in this film i really can not understand why this movie is in the cinemas now even this should not be on tvs while i was watching i thought to leave cinema salon for a moment to protest this horrible movie but anyway i did not like it at all and if you really like the good quality movies sorry but this is not for you,comedy
when you talk about hollywood cinema you would talk about films like the shawshank redemption the godfather citizen kane scarface the dark knight titanic the departed now add the in that legendary listnow get this straight the directed by todd phillips is maybe the best film youll seen in years to come or even in decades to come fantasitc would be the most appropriate word to describe this masterpiece all said  done the is cinema at its very best performances bradely cooper is excellent zach galifianakis is outstanding as alan ed helms is superb justin bartha leaves an impact even though hes only there for a cameo heather graham looks angelic as always and delivers a sincere performance as the hooker others are perfect in their partson the whole the is a masterpiece i enjoyed each and every minute of this venture two big thumbs up,comedy
i decided to go to this movie with some classmates after our last test before summer vacation the girls had some mixed feelings they thought it was gonna be a black comedy with humour only men can relate to they were wrong since the movie begin both girls and guys where laughing 247 its a fast and really entertaining movie i went with a group of completely different kind of people they all loved itnot only we had a laugh we where sucked into the movie as well it kept us on the edge of our seat the entire time the story line is incredible creative and builds up tension really goodyou will love it so go see it,comedy
i dont write reviews at all really but this movie is the funniest this year it is comparable to 40 year old virgin and pineapple express heck its even better makes you laugh every two minutes the comedy keeps on coming the cast is extraordinary the acting is brilliantand the comedy is pure genius the characters are quirky and really amusing the story is very interesting and entertaining nonetheless this movie truly stands out and the ratings only further my point go watch this movie i know i did and so did a dozen other people good story great acting awesome comedy two thumbs up all the way if youve been waiting for nonstop laughter this is it my friends,comedy
movierantsbythedoctorblogspotcom this experience has me wanting to be hungover in vegas not remembering a thing you have to admit sometimes the most interestinginvigorating thing you can do is freak out about what you did last night and try to put the pieces together id say that would make a great movie but nothey went beyond that and made the movie gut busting id say i havent laughed that hard for a movie in a long time bradley cooper was great he was the cool guy in the group who had a lot of the ideas the cracks about his life were awesome and i am sure something all guys can relate too especially the family men its crazy how they had the regular circle of friends for the movie the smart one ed helmes characterandy from the office who did some really stupid stuff marrying heather graham though was the smartest thing he has ever done would be any mans dream come true the cool one bradley coopers character mentioned earlier and the retarded one zach galifianakis he was so dumb because basically he was comic relief for a comic which just basically added to the laughs i am pretty sure his character in a baby standing silent with those glasses on made me laughi dont know what to say i cant think of anything bad to say about this movie at some point i was put off but i cant remember when because they immediately recovered with an awesome laugh so thats what i am going to do i am going to say only positive things about it and just say that if you are feeling blue and in need of good medicine this movie deals out the best of it and in mega quantities so go see the for a good time,comedy
when did i laugh so much for a movielong time if you are in for a good laughgo for it the movie is just fantastically made with all the characters fitting in perfectly for the roles bradley cooper zach galifianakis and ed helms are all so very amazing its vegas baby and who doesnt want to be there the script is perfect for the location bachelor party and the director todd phillips has just made a wonder out of it except for the scene where they carry back the tiger i never felt that there was any moment in the movie that looked unreal plain movie where circumstances take them around and made such a good humorous flick out of it phil bradley cooper the cool dude driving the story with alan zach in all that crazy stuff and stu ed helms cracking those comments just perfectly fit in to make it a mind blowing hilarious flick a special mention to jade heather graham who looks lovely as ever making the guys skip a beat for sure mike tyson with his best punch and the chinese guy ken jeong with his unique style just make it a worth watch file liked the last part the most where they check out the pics and finally have the mystery unfoldedmust watch movie guys i did already twice,comedy
this film was amazing from start to finish i was laughing all the way through my mom was even laughing and she doesnt even like crude humor but she said she wanted to see something funny for her birthday and she even said it was the funniest movie shes ever seenthe cast is amazing and the writing was great as well it balances out the humor quite well and doesnt seem to make fun of one general thing to much racegenderhomosexuality the movie always seems to surprise you and it is nearly impossible to guess what happens next which is a big plus for memy one complaint about the movie is that near the end it kind of felt pushed i would say the last 20 min but its all made up for with a great ending and a few pictures from the wild night during the creditsthe movie is pretty vulgar im not going to lie but some of the situations that they are put into are just so funny you cant help but laugh i remember at one point i was literally in tears not just watery eyes tearsif you want to laugh a lot see this movie,comedy
probably the worst picture of the year for me in terms of disappointed expectations i didnt laugh once during the entire length of this socalled comedy witless charmless without one likable character in its ensemble cast i was especially dumbfounded by the hype accorded to zach galifianakis whose lack of talent somehow manages to make adam sandler look like a comic geniusthe is obviously targeted to an audience who likes their humor broad and sophomoric to make matters worse it relies heavily on obnoxious stereotypes that are patently offensivethis piece of dreck utterly pales in comparison to a similar buddy flick the eminently watchable i love you man the was an utter waste of time and money caveat emptor,comedy
the detective story we have many cases where humor is overlainbut we have few cases where the mystery involves the detectives usually the detective is implicated in some way or is involved through some matter of honor other than d o a i do not know of another film where the detectives were the victims the jokes work here as does the pacing it has energy but the thing that intrigues me is the mystery we have a missing tooth and a missing groom there is an unexplained animal baby police car wedding and pursuer the setup with a pending wedding that sets the clock ticking probably relies overly on us having seen sidewaysthe strange engineering here is the distance maintained between the guy world and the girl world its too consistent and effective to be mere intuition there are script consultants for this sort of thing but it is so well integrated i believe it have been there at the beginning we have the chatty quite lovely bride steeping in girlie stuff in soft poses there is a prostitute who factors in the mystery it seems they had to reach far to find someone as appealing as heather graham needy attractive innocent but still a hooker and then there is the bitch harder than any stereotype known to methe result is the reinforcement of the insular pretend work which we enter in order to enjoy the story los vegas is just a way of assigning a space as is the idea of locating on the roofteds evaluation  3 of 3 worth watching,comedy
what unadulterated tripe ive never seen such utter kak in all my life not only was it insulting to someone of moderate intelligence to class it as humourwhat can i say id rather have stuck hot needles in my eyes this movie was so boring the whole reason you go and see a supposed funny movie is so that it makes you laugh not in this case you d rather see the stupid characters in this film run over by a double decker bus thatd be a lot more funnymike tyson has a cameo role in the movie and boy is he a bad actor i know he isnt one to trade but his scenes should definitely have been left on the cutting room floor like many other aspects of the movie he was cringe worthy people will argue that his stint in the film was crucial to the plot which goes to show just how bad this film really is if they could have done without itjust crude predictable drivel no plot annoying characters and a bad script i also hate it when they use swearing to try and make something seem funnier than it really is albeit nothing is funny in this pathetic excuse for a film i d quite happily have killed all four leads especially that guy with the beard who does he think he is jeff bridges let me tell you hes a long way off being that what a terrible comedic actor just genuinely annoyingi normally wouldnt t write anything on the boards but after having read so many people saying it was hilariously funny i really had to through my tuppence worth in to the contraryto sum up i d rather have watched a greasy bogey slide down a window than watch thisif you wanna see something funny about guys partying in vegas watch goa whole lot more entertainingsave yer dough and spend it on something worthwhile a pint of bitter or something,comedy
the first time i watched this movie with my sister and daughter i thought we were going to get kicked out of the theater for disturbing the peace we were laughing so hard three viewings later i still laugh out loud and i cant wait to have a permanent copy in my home the setup took a little long before launching into the action but was necessary to give us a good look at each character with a lot of payoffs all the way over the top humor with an over the top premise kept the tone and pacing perfect there were a few things that were unbelievable leaving a baby in a car and a guy in a trunk in that las vegas heat but never interfered with the entertainment value bless the investors  im sure theyre dancing in the streets after this success,comedy
i just returned from the theater where i saw the and i must admit with what i saw from it first i wouldnt have chosen it myself but a very foxy lady italian redhead and a nice rack asked me if i wanted to see that one and any guy will know that if a girl like that asks you out she chooses the movie awaiting her arrival i met my cousin up front and he told me he thoughtthe was that chick flick after just watching the film for 2 minutes bradley cooper appeared on the screen and my date said oh god hes so hot thats the reason why i wanted to see the film at this point i didnt really think this movie was going to be something but soon i had to review my opinionthe humour in this movie for starters is of different levels there is the sexual innuendoteenhumour there are crazy and absurd situations there is some slapstick basically whatever humour you favour this movie has got it youll laugh at some point in the filmthe beginning of the movie gives you a great feeling it really somehow has that vibe of fear and loathing in las vegas where you also had the feeling that you wanted to experience the same fun the actors in that movie had you just feel like youre on a magical ride with them and you regret not being there in real lifethe characters in this movie are really worked out nicely both by the screenplay as well as the actors hot shot of the evening bradley cooper really gave me the impression like he was an incredible fun person to be around with and id definitely want phil his character in the movie to be my friend in real life zach galifianakis alan plays a great annoying little moron too in the beginning of the movie you hate him and youd wish they dump him in the desert but he manages to win you over by his at least good naturea nice addition to the movie is ken jeong who plays a probably gay leader of the chinese mafia who seems obsessed by imitating western africanamerican slang and manners normally im not too fond of asian actors but this one really give the movie extra humourdont let a weak trailer keep you from seeing this movie ive enjoyed it immensely and had quite a few laughs while im usually not the kind to break out in laughter,comedy
absolute coolness great movie a mustown comedy the way the storys told and portrayed is excellent im trying to find a fault but the movie is pretty well balanced doesnt bail out on the ending either year one this one follows thru right to the end has to be there at the top of my top movies ever and thats a nuff said i believe a strong indicator of a movies success in popular culture is if people clap at the ending last time i saw it happen was with wanted and this movie is much stronger than wanted in my opinion this movie ended people just clapped and thats great now im not saying this is foolproof  i liked the mist ending and people in the movies hated it  but yeah you get the drift if not open the windows bombo clat,comedy
with writers churning out script after mundane script and story lines weaker than the state of some actors after a hard night on the town this film is exactly what those who have a need a breath of fresh air this is the funniest film of the decade compare it to the likes of yes man which has jim carrey to carry the story but this script calls upon actors of lesser known fame and it does the script and film more justice than having a well known cast member i am not criticising yes man either by the way the laughs are sustained throughout and you are able to explore the night before the morning after we have all been there but it has never been this amusing even calling upon physical attributes of the actors for jokes ie weight or facial hair allow this script to have more depth than modern day thrillers a true classic is born in the shape of the ,comedy
the is currently number 1 at the us box office and its doing well here in the uk toothis isnt surprising  its a funny movie on the eve of dougs wedding he and his two best friends and his fiances brother take a stag trip to las vegas all is well until the next morning when the friends wake up in their hotel suite with no memory of the previous nights events a gap where a tooth used to be a chicken a tiger a baby  oh and no doug the rest of the movie tells of the increasingly desperate attempts by the friends to reconstruct what happened last night so that they can hopefully retrieve doug in time to get him to his weddingi never believed the events of this movie for a second but that didnt really matter there was sufficient suspension of disbelief for the improbable narrative to work and it was always fun to be in the company of these well fleshed out if caricatureish charactersthere arent too many belly laughs but the humour is constant and organic  i found myself chuckling all the way throughspecial mention must go to ken jeong who is a deliriously effete chinese crime tsar and who has the most memorable onscreen entrance of any character in any movie i can remember,comedy
i actually made an account just to review this movie because it was one of the funniest movies ive ever seen and ive seen superbad p so the humour is topdrawer sure its very crude and even slap stick in some places but that just makes the film so much funnier the 3 main characters not including doug have great chemistry with each other both in acting and comedy and the side characters like the two crazy police officers and the gay chinese mobster were simply qualityall in all it was 625 thats was well spent the storyline was excellent subtly combining many classic comedies to enhance the already fantastic quality storyline and humour hats off to the script writers the director and the cast for a simply hilarious moviewatch it asap,comedy
anybody who comments about how this is a guys only film should know that my doctorate wife laughed as hard and frequent as i have ever seen her laugh this is an exceptionally wellwritten movie there was only one spot where i felt i knew what was happening next the asian bad guy mr chow was very funny at first but his gay side was overdone the ending was superb bringing the entire picture to closure for us we laughed throughout the entire movie my wife did not feel offended and we both want to go see it again this movie is very well madeit should be stated that we find very few funny movies being made in the past decade the is a huge exception this is a comedy with creativity i havent heard that much laughter in a theatre since theres something about mary i imagine that movie also insulted some people with some of its vulgar humor the poster who said he felt he wasted 20 on the movie and the food he bought at the theater has judgment that cannot be trusted after all who spends that much on food at a movie theater,comedy
i love humor its one of my favorite film genres and i like all kinds of outrageous comedy ranging from borat to theres something about mary to spike lees she hate me i laughed so hard during these films i thought i would fall out of my seat this proves im certainly not a prude or squeamish but the is such a bad film i barely chuckled or even smiled anyone who has ever experienced  or dealt with people who have been physically andor sexually abused will probably feel a bit disturbed by seeing simulated sexual abuse and calling it funny i have to admit i finally walked out of the theater because beside being depraved in a bad way the film was also desperately boring i could care less about any of the main characters and the humor was so unimaginative and forced the films trailers fooled me into thinking the would be worth checking out its not the first time a trailer was much better than the film nor will it be the lastunfortunately i wasted 1000 during a recession the next time i see something as bad as the i intend to get a refundfor those who think child abuse is not funny read licensing parents can we prevent child abuse and neglect and raising safe kids in an unsafe world 30 simple ways to prevent your child from being lost abducted or abused,comedy
i realize theres an audience for crass juvenile comedies and while i myself dont enjoy them i am capable of understanding what it is about them that amuses some people i might even manage a chuckle or two while watching one always under duress and never by choice the however baffles me it is so witless so humorless so vulgar and so senseless its success astounds me i cant imagine anyone not having undergone a lobotomy finding anything remotely funny about this film which doesnt come close to fulfilling the potential of its plot how it grossed nearly 500 million at the box office is beyond my comprehension had i paid to see it i would demand a refund as it is i feel everyone associated with it owes me the 90 minutes of my life i lost watching it sticking with it to the end only because i needed to see if there was at least one laugh before the final credits trust me there isnt,comedy
if youve liked very bad things you will definitively not like this movie seems like a bad copy of that filmthis film was recommended by a friend of mine saying he laughed his way through the whole film i assume that his humor tastes are more middleoftheroadish or maybe he had a similar experience in vegas so he could connect to the ridiculous events on screen i think i laughed twicei dont think this film should be in the top 2000 lest alone in the top 250 there must be something very wrong with the rating system on imdbif you choose your movies based on ratings on imdb make an exception for this one rather rewatch very bad things or fear and loathing,comedy
i keep up late for watching this movie  but its nothing but vogues  at the end of this movie at the same night i watched just like heaven it was awesome than rating  62  till 28aug09 this by the way  story begins when a person wanted to get married and his friends wanted to throw a bachelor party to him we all know its a common concept from various movies  and they made lame jokes in every moment  i couldnt found anything interesting in this movie expect the ending but not much interesting in their bachelor at party they took drugs and lost mind and lost their one friend who is getting married tomorrow in the whole movie they tried to find their lost friend and at last they found him at the top of the roof  and at last he got married  simple and boring story just a lame movie please dont watch it,comedy
i felt so out of touch with everyone when i got around to seeing this film after all it has a very respectable score on imdb and a lot of folks seemed to like ityet i found it about as enjoyable as dental surgery part of the problem might be that i only watched it because i was bored and on a cruise ship with a very limited selection of dvds part of it might be because the day before also out of boredom i watched hot tub time machineand it was practically the same filmthe is a story about four completely unlikable guys who seem more like caricatures than anyone youd ever meet in addition they were so unlike each other you wonder if such friendships ever exist anywhere but in a hollywood film one is the guy who is about to get marriedand wants to screw some hookers before he ties the knot how heartwarming one is a handsome school teacher who is just nasty and 100 unlikable one is a screwup and idiotso they naturally make him the fat guy and the other is the man in a relationship with a castrating female if these sound familiar they were pretty much the same characters youd see in hot tub time machinebut even more onedimensional and this is especially true for the last two characters i mentioned they go to vegas accidentally ingest some of the date rape drug and do lots of insane thingslittle of which is particularly funny and this is the problem with the film if you laugh at very lowbrow humor dont mind that the plot makes no sense such as the tasering scene and think that a dirty word is the punchline for most jokes then youll enjoy the film as for me i can enjoy a dopey film such as talladega nights or strange brewbut there is a limit to dopiness plus its hard to stick with a movie when you simply dont care what happens to any of them overall overrated unlike any recent movie i have seen unpleasant unfunny and for the undemanding,comedy
this movie was not good at all the whole time that it played all of 100 minutes of it i sat their bored out of my mind this however is because i am not a fan of the dumb funny movies i honestly do not see how this movie became so popular then again it was probably watched by mostly guys i have seen a few other dumb funny movies and felt the same way about them i do not get and do not think that i will ever get what makes this movie so funny i will continue to be against them and will suggest that people do not go see them but who will listen to me i am one person with an opinion that will probably go against tons and tons of people that find humor in people acting dumb and well that is not me sure i might laugh here and there but only at how much work they put into the things that would not usually be funny but are funny now because other people said it was hopefully some people will side with me and agree that this movie was nonsense,comedy
someone told me not that long ago that the 2003 film old school was the f bomb and todd phillips old school is moderately a winner for imdb users i saw it and damn i liked better the other two comedies of its director todd phillips that i had seen starsky  hutch and school for scoundrels which by the way are usually paned by imdb users not to mention by professional critics especially phillips 2006 remake of a british 1960 picture now this year phillips came with the it had its us theatrical release a couple of months ago on 5 june 2009 to be exact and boy is it a winner for users and professional critics plus a great money maker for everything i had to see the last friday finally arrived to my city and boy did i laughed a couple of days ago last sunday to be exact at the theater if you are one of those angry imdbs top 250 buffs im not a really big follower and i think the other times i have commented about the top 250 were when nolans dark knight reached the first position and when walle had a place in the top 10 that are always like good film but why is it part of the awesome top 250 or like why this film is not in the top you may be wondering if this film deserves its place in the list of 250 best films for the users right now it is the 191 i can say to those that who knows who cares the is a film that in the way old school didnt lived up to all the praise and like i already said i really laughed with the time in las vegas of phil bradley cooper doug justin bartha stu ed helmskind of looks like mclovin and alan zach galifianakisand as is tradition these folks went to las vegas for dougs bachelor party for us is not really a problem the fact that we went to las vegas with our main characters and basically missed the party time certainly not a problem since for us theres fun before and after the crazy party time but for our main characters i add doug will get married with alans sister tracy played by sasha barrese and dougs best friends are stu and phil is a problem but no they didnt went to las vegas and missed completely of the crazy fun time actually and mostly just apparently they had a really f crazy night and that apparently is actually the big problem since our characters simply do not remember a single thing the morning after the big vegas night not to mention that doug aint around of course the guy who may be not be as funny as the others bartha is nowhere to be seen almost the entire film its a only with the funny guys and certainly not the usual they stu phil and alan wake up not remembering a thing and just wondering why a tiger and a baby are in their suite and stuff its all a mystery they must find doug but pretty much every time theres a little peace after putting some pieces together a damn big crazy thing comes to make more f unbelievable their secret vegas anecdote sure they met mike tyson and his tiger but and certainly more f funny heather graham ken jeong mike tyson mike epps hell even when bartha the may not be as funny as the other main guys returns or better said is found he is really hilarious red doug,comedy
i watched this movie without any real hopes of seeing a great comedy i was expecting a movie that would make me laugh in certain situations but i was so very wrong the is one of the most memorable comedies ever madethe script is very well written the jokes are unique fun and the most important thing is that they arent silly as most of the jokes in comedies nowadays are the characters are very well created they make you care for them and feel them and most of all they are funny you must know what im talking about the acting is great there isnt any overacting and even if there is it makes you laugh so hard that you forget all about it i wont bother writing the storyline or any of the jokes in order to make this movie experience even better for those of you who havent seen the movie yet but i assure you if nothing else it will make you laughi recommend this movie to everyone who has ever been drunk married bored etc basically i would just like to say that i recommend this movie to every single person and yes its that greatbest regards from slovenia,comedy
the will make you want to grab your credit card and call your travel agent luckily i dont have to i am leaving for vegas on thursday and i only wish i have half as much fun as these guys didrowdy raucous and a touch raunchy the comes at you with full comic force and doesnt let up even through the end credits this is a comedy the way i like my comedies untamed and out of control i laughed my synonym for donkey offafter sitting through what seems like my 500th bromance how wonderful for a movie to pull out the comic stops with a clever story and so many great gags that youll be talking about long after the lights come upthe casting and performances are perfect zach getastagenameforgodssake finally has a breakout role the direction is spot onand heather graham darling you look as good as ever at 39 if i were married i would leave my wife for youbruno you have a hard movie to top,comedy
thoroughly dreadful film you would have to be mentally deranged to find one second of hilarity in the 100 minutes of total tedium i gave it 1 out of 10 simply because i couldnt give it a minus vote but in reality it deserves at least 100000010 how this total crap could ever spawn 2 sequels is beyond me this film is as funny as burying one of your parents apart from several scenes of male bums the highlights of the dialog are ive lost a tooth and the moment when the cast give it all away this is so illegal can you see the funpart which part of this is fun dont waste part of your life expecting the funniest film ever made dont waste part of your life watching a funny film dont even waste part of your life watching the most overhyped film ever produced drop a brick on your foot youll laugh more about it than watching this,comedy
this has all the makings of something really special and a film where men especially can relate to on one of their drunken nights when they cannot remember the night before is it always because the party is so good that you cannot remember  somehow do not think so and as the car sped off and they took their first drink on the roof tops i was almost rubbing my hands together in anticipationthen disappointment it was suddenly the next morning and as the film unfolded we see how many ridiculous activities they could get up to in one night think they must have ran our of hours if this was a comedy then i want my money back this did not even produce a smile then i read that part 2 is not so funny,comedy
star rating  saturday night  friday night  friday morning  sunday night  monday morning theres lots of places id like to visit in america with its fifty one states and stapling as the most powerful country in the world but las vegas to be honest has always stood out as one i could quite comfortably avoid the emphasis to me has always seemed to be on the casinos and ive never gambled in my life well ive brought the odd lottery ticket but of course theres also plenty of super hotels nightclubs world class showsthe place would seem to have something for everyone but from the sweeping over shots on the opening of the my main problem with it now is that it all looks too over whelming to me with bursting visual stimuli coming from every pore designed to inflame the senses as ned flanders well described it in an episode of the simpsons a place where its against the law to be responsible as piers morgan more worryingly described it in a recent newspaper article for the mail aya napa and ibiza are wild enough for me but if you had the time and the money just how out of control would things be if you had your stag night in vegas theres people in the world that could do that and thats the high concept idea of this filmhow wild it gets is that the groom doug justin bertha goes missingthats without mentioning a trashed hotel room a tiger in the bathroom a baby in the closet a stolen cop car and the naked chinese man who turns out to be a camp triad boss who jumps out the boot somehow smooth phil bradley cooper charmless alan zach galifianakis and meek stu ed helms must make sense of it all while searching for their friend whos getting married in less than twenty four hours its such a simple but effective idea that probably works so well because of its what ifpotential men together are laddish and egg each other on and just how out of control could things be and just what would the consequences be of course a lot of the humour is facile and over the top but it works well with the tone of the film in thats the mindset of the men involved and quite often the film is pant wettingly hilariousthe director who luckily has a string of well known credits behind him has taken a cast of unknowns and produced a highly successful high concept comedy thats inspired and original and like the best of them nowadays about as politically correct as a drunken roy chubby brown as such its definitely one of the better comedies of recent times ,comedy
oh my god i simply had to write this critique straight off the theaters there is no way to exemplify how much fun and original this movie is without raving on and on about it all night which would make me disclose a million spoilers and you dont want me to do thatits about four friends one of them is getting married in two days and they decide to go to las vegas to have their bachelor party everything starts out all right with the four dudes toasting atop the rooftop of their vegas hotel to a wonderful unfolding night and then we fast forward to the next morning when three of them awake in their hotel bedroom which is wrecked beyond repair and features a hilarious set of new additions and they notice the groom is missing whats worse none remembers what happened the night before and so begins their twoday adventure through vegas trying to find their lost partner and in the way discovering the hysterically crazy things they did that nightat first it may seem like your typical bromedy and you indulge in the movies plot expecting to have a few laughs and later forget about it but you get oh so much more the character development is spoton the plot is seriously funny and wow believable even in its absurdity the performances are very good the directing is awesome the film actually involves you and it doesnt take itself too seriously and it doesnt try to be funny unlike other comedies who seem to strain themselves to force laughter out of you this is a truly special comedy perhaps the best comedy ive seen all yearthe screenplay itself is worthy of its praise and i wouldnt be amazed if it pulls a stunt at next years oscars receiving an academy award nod todd phillips certainly reinvindicated himself and his film earned a rightful spot among those which well remember for some time to come why its even better than pineapple express and i love you man which i also consider to be excellent bromedieswhether you simply want to be entertained or whether you want to experience a fun modern comedy thats both hilarious and perfectlymade you cant miss out on this onerating 3 and a half stars out of 4,comedy
i had been expecting the to be released in theatres here in peru for some time  the movie was ridiculously wellreceived in the states and it eventually became one of the most unexpectedly popular movies of the year why it took so much time to arrive in peru god only knows  or maybe the ones who have the distribution rights too  but the fact of the matter is that unlike other movies of its ilk it has arrived in peruvian theatres much for the delight of local movie buffs and average joes and thats because being a sortof independent movie  yes it was produced by a big studio but it features no big name stars and it was made with a pretty limited budget  no one expected it to be as funny as other comedies featuring more recognizable actors and inflated budgets but it is the is decidedly hilarious  the funniest motion picture ive seen in the last three years or so actuallywhen i say the is the funniest movie ive seen in recent years i really mean it the whole point of the movie is to watch these guys trying to remember what happened during their night of craziness looking for clues everywhere they can interrogating people who seem to have partied or done stuff with them although they cant remember being with them this leads to a whole lot of ridiculous and overthetop situations which include but are not limited to  realizing that they got involved with some sort of crazy gay asian gangster that the tiger they stole  yes stole  belonged to mike tyson or that phil spend a portion of the night in the hospital the movie doesnt provide with anything particularly outrageous  theres plenty of bodily fluids and profanity although nothing that hasnt been seen before  but it is nevertheless hilarious because it knows how to exploit its funniest bits without tiring the viewernone of the principal actors are particularly wellknown but they nevertheless seem to belong in this movie playing these parts bradley cooper is great as phil portraying him as a sort of asshole who despite being what he is can be likable from time to time ed helms plays the outofplace nerd who discovers that he can be pretty wild and crazy if he wants to  or if he has consumed enough alcohol  and does it marvelously the weirdest  and by far funniest  characters is alan who as portrayed by zach galifianakis is definitely the most memorable character in the film his strange personality can lead to some awkward situations  take the blood brothers oath for example  but also to some of the most hysterical situations ive seen in any comedy the ears its r rating by having some profanity and showing a couple of bare male buttocks  you know male nudity always seem to cause viewers to laugh  but it isnt as shocking as other films of its ilk it doesnt need to be it only needs to be funny and it accomplishes this goal beautifullyi really wanted to see the and now that i have done so i cant say i was disappointed considering so many hollywood comedies nowadays fail to make me laugh simply because they are too stupid or too derivative its refreshing to watch a raunchy comedy thats actually funny it also helps that its main characters despite not being particularly threedimensional or realistic are charismatic enough for the audience to care for them the movie laughs with these guys not at them most of the time and thats why despite having a couple of stupid parts it never really feels overly dumb what can i say with some solid performances hilarious gags and jokes and very original premise  i really wonder why a movie hadnt been done before at least as effectively as this one  the is an stupendous comedy it will hardly offend anyone and it should make most audiences cry with laughter,comedy
the classical stagparty has always been a popular subject in sexual comediesthe makes an innovative twist setting the story on the day after the bachelor partythe result is an excellent comedy which made me have a great timethe resulted to be much better than what i expected because of its sober tone and ingenious screenplaywhich exaggerates enough in order to make us laughat the same time it tells us a very interesting story which is well structuredi like to finally see a comedy which does not forget to endorsing the laughs with a solid storythe movie uses elements we have seen on other comedies like the prostitute with a good heart or the expensive car of the fatherinlaw they have to take special care but they are used on a natural wayand they are well implemented to the storybut i think the best element from this movie is the brilliant castdirector todd phillips made the good decision of selecting a solid cast with excellent instincts for comedyi also appreciated the fact that the actors are not hollywood starsbecause that makes the situations from the movie more realisticit would have been very easy and commercially less risky to hire vince vaughnowen wilsonben stiller or dane cookbut i really appreciate that phillips did not fall on that trapbecause if he did thatthe situations portrayed in the would not have felt so reali also appreciated that besides all the rudeness from the jokesthe has good moments of human warmth and friendshipi took an enormous surprise with this brilliant comedyand i gave it a very enthusiastic recommendation to anyone who wants to have a memorable and hugely funny time,comedy
only reason i am adding my two cents in is because i want to negate one negative rating on this site i havent laughed this much since blazing saddles and people that is a long time ago i thought the was brilliant my 12 year old son begged me to take himthat much i fear i should have did a little investigation a couple of scenes warrant nc17 i figured okay another pineapple express for my son whats 90 minutes of boredom no biggie i went in blindly then wam this was funny funny stuff if you didnt laugh thats sad maybe time to lighten up for me these were original and fresh gags and im no fan of rrated sexist slap stick usually filled with mindless moronic nonsense but this movie is the bomb it is definitely a mans movie thoughthe writers are fantastic comedians with the utmost timing the acting is superb who are these dudes the only actor i recognized was heather graham and she was awesome too 2 thumbs up im buying the dvd for sure no exaggeration for me this was the comedy of the decade,comedy
todd phillips did it again he create this crazy comedy which only him can do im a great fan of road trip and old school these movies are my favorite comedy movies of all time but i think that the guys who rate on imdb are complete idiots because to rate 82 is the dumbest thing anyone can do rate of road trip is 64 and rate of old school is 7 come on guys these two movies are way better than my rate of is 7 because many comedies which are better than are rate lower i first saw zach galifianakis in this movie and he is the trade mark of this movie he is the heather graham is hot as always im sorry of jeffrey tambor because he is the man he is the funniest grandfather ever but he is in this movie for couple of minutes but he rules remember him in arrested development bravo for the casting and thank you todd phillips for another great comedy,comedy
i recommend this film to people who wont be easily offended and want to see a good comedy film in theaters or on dvd with a few friendsthis film is ridiculously funny with an interesting plot memorable characters and a fun storypositives  the central characters are all excellent they are not just walking punchlines although galifianakis comes close they actually feel like real peoplethe humor is excellent this isnt a couple chuckles movie this is a laugh out loud every couple minutes moviethe narrative is excellent making you wonder what the hell they did the night before and having you guess with the characters as to their actions a favorite moment is when the chicken is walking around the room all i could think while laughing was what the hell did they do with that chicken at the end of most of the scenes theres also a fun surprise twist something you didnt expect to see and makes you laugh at the same timenegatives  im really just nitpicking here because the movie was really good however i didnt care for some of the shock humor shock humor is something like showing an old mans ass during a prostate exam which they do in this movie it wasnt used often but it was irritating when they did itrob wriggle and the lady playing the other police officer are very overthetop and dont really feel like real characterssome story threads remain unresolved at the end i wouldve liked to see what happened when the uncle saw the car on the return and i wouldve liked some closure on other story threads but it didnt really impact my enjoyment of the filmsome of zach galifianakis lines seemed forced but even the forced lines are kind of funny so i didnt mind that muchoverall  the film is ridiculously funny and if you watch it with a few friends who arent easily offended you will probably have a good time810  some flaws but not enough to take away from the enjoyment of the film,comedy
i went to this movie with extremely high expectations i took my girlfriend along who is not to interested in same type of comedies that i am lets just say with in five minutes into the movie myself the crowd and my girl were all in stitches it is a great movie with so many funny parts that i will be watching it again the people who are behind this movie are the guys from old school which too was a great movie great job another winner best movie of the summer and possibly the year i took my time out to register for this site just so i could comment about how great this movie is def worth seeing and then buying for your home collection,comedy
i laughed once at this movie where the wedding singer does 50 cents candy shop apart from this nothing the acting was okay the characters too the main thing that was lacking was a good script you know what youre gonna get with one of these kind of movies but unfortunately this just didnt deliver i had a few beers before and was ready to laugh but this movie just couldnt deliver them shame because the premise sounded fairly good i dont like trashing movies but i think its best that if you must see this movie then dont expect a lot and you wont be too disappointed i know lots of people rated it highly but i cant think why for the life of me im not a prude and laughed pretty good at stepbrothers and stuff of this ilk which you can call puerile and stupid im just very disappointed that the most important thing of the whole film was just not up to it cos everything else was there sorry guys,comedy
what do you get when you take the concept of dude wheres my car add mike tyson a tiger and set it in vegas the result is a bloody masterpiece director todd philips old school has outdone himself and brings us his latest comedy thats so rude profane offensive and raunchy you just cant help but laugh with days before his wedding doug justin burtha aka riley off national treasure takes his friends phil bradley cooper  hes just not that into you stu the daily shows ed helms and dougs joaquin phoenix look alike brother allan zach galifianakis out on a road trip to vegas for a night theyll never forget the next morning phil stu and alan wake up hungover with a tiger along with a baby in hiding their hotel room and doug missing with only a day left to find him the men set out on a city wide search using csi tactics but the question is can they find him in time for the wedding the is a you wont forget anytime soon it takes what could have been just your average r rated raunchfest and turn it into something thats fun classy and utterly outrageous thanks to the hilarious and likable chemistry between the cast at moments youll feel that the comedy is forced and some of the crudeness felt unneeded but at the end youll realize youve had such a fun time you wont even remember its flaws this is sure to be an instant classic and is by far the best comedy of 2009 but its made for a certain audience in mind so if sex jokes profanity or partial nudity isnt for you then you might want to sit this one out for those that dont care about that if youre looking for a comedy loaded with fun heart and cameos mike tyson being the most obvious one then grab 10 sneak in a bottle of vodka bring your friends and let this be a you wont forget,comedy
first off we were a bit reluctant to see this movie after reading its plot summary but the rating 84 at the time and all the positive user comments made us give this movie a chanceneedless to say we regret doing soperhaps it is a mistake perhaps this movie should have been given 48 instead of 84 and even this would be too generous in my opinion the movie is not only a clich of hollywood bachelors night what happens in vegas stays in vegas type of films but 999 of the jokes were either tasteless or completely predictable the actors did not even do a remotely good job and the screenplay writers did absolutely nothing to help them along the wayi still want someone to explain to me what was so different about this movie,comedy
minor spoilerswhy cant america produce decent comedy any morei mean seriously this is the country that gave us the blues brothers dr strangelove some like it hot airplane and even blazing saddles why cant it be done todaythe is a prime example of missed timing and poor delivery the worst offender by far being zach galifianakis playing the part of the oddball alannow the guys i saw this film with tell me they loved it which goes to show how subjective humour is but to me zach really didnt seem to give a damn on the set his performance is flat he really seems to have no sense of comedic timing and manages to utterly flatten almost every scene he is unwise enough to open his mouth in however in the spirit of fairness ill note that his character exists for only two reasons1 to play as the dork come good  rain man savant at a crucial but blatantly telegraphed point and2 to be the oddmanoutsider and obligatory grossout characterin the first of these he succeeds well enough  its not exactly a revelation in the plot when it happens and heather graham steals the scene with a knowing piece of overacting in the second role oh dear gods no just noas for the rest of the cast well they struggle gamely with insipid characters flat direction and subdude wheres my car scriptingthe film plays essentially as a series of loosely connected sketches some hit some miss but none ever reaches a real crescendo it all feels hackneyed and well unoriginalin summary it isnt a terrible film but it isnt good either its just dull and that is a real failing in a comedyworth having on if youre with mates and drunk i cant recommend it otherwise oh and there is a sequel in development i cant express my enthusiasm really,comedy
i didnt plan on seeing the movie in theaters but after everybody telling me the movie was the funniest movie they had seen in years and even imdb having it in the top 250 i thought i would give a tryi saw the trailer for the months ago and my immediate impression was not full of high expectations everybody who has been completely hammered before knows that even on their worst night of drinking you usually dont wake up with a baby in the closet and a tiger in the bathroom the comedy just seemed a bit far stretched and forcedi did laugh pretty hard for the first 10 minutes but after the beginning the humor dwindled halfway through the movie my friend leaned over and commented on how ridiculous the storyline was and i couldnt agree more the annoying thing about the movie was that the humor was not intelligent except for zack galifianakis if your a fan of zack g then you know his standup is brilliant and hilarious but the movie as a whole will let you down though i will say zach g made the movie worth watching i was hoping to see a movie that topped wedding crashers or pineapple express but the movie didnt even come close the movie was not horrible but top 250 come on thats insulting if your a big fan of intelligent comedies i wouldnt waste your time at the theater and wait for it to come out on dvd this movie is a classic case of mainstream comedy that will top the box offices but just doesnt deliver,comedy
i signed up for imdb just so i could review this piece of bland garbage there is no character development no dramatic tension everybody is nearly the same character the oh man what happened last night thing gets old after about three minutes cheap unbelievable situations they got themselves into predictable jokes and cruel unlikely gags the kids tasering the prisoner look i married a stripper and she treats me like she knows me so well how is this even possible most of the crazy things that happened did not seem believable the movie simply came up with the same tired clichs and put them together and expected the audience to swoon oh and the wussy guy finally tells off his nagging woman at the end of the movie big deal we saw that coming overall it was a hamfisted attempt to redo the we got drunk and did crazy things movie,comedy
i was looking forward to this movie based on some enthusiastic word of mouth from a couple of acquaintances as i stared at the screen with my expression becoming blank then black and without ever laughing out loud all i could think of was that some movies make you look differently at the people who recommend them the is a base empty mess wrapped in some slick packaging and hypei know the party line from some but certainly not other reviews the movie is a wild grossout fun ride that goes down smooth quirky buddies try to reconstruct a wild bachelor party night in las vegas after they black out and wake up the next day in their trashed hotel suite with their friend the groom missing they are a supposedly likable bunch of a weirdacting stoner slob a dorky dentist with a domineering unfaithful longtime girlfriend an irresponsible selfcentered hunk and a dour boy scout in their adventures they encounter colorful characters like smartmouth cops a sleazy owner of a quickie wedding chapel and mike tyson magically rich no longer bankrupt with some canned eccentricities addedthe problem is that the movie does nothing but string together a series of gags  either crude or violent or both  that grow more and more depressing the clearer it becomes that everything about the movie is shallow phony and clich the missing night reconstructed over the course of the movie with any remaining graphic details gratuitously laid on thick over the end credits is strikingly unimaginative drunken time with hookers the drunk henpecked dork marries a singlemom hooker with a heart of gold and then falls for her for real the awkward slob as genius at cards the groom swearing renewed undying devotion to his fianc trashing fancy and cop cars stuckup rich parents of the bride totally wasting jeffrey tambor as to the mattress tossed from high up down on top of the hotel statue it is an embarrassing plot contrivance conveniently to delay finding the groom that no one investigates until the last minute the source of the damage including the police or hotel staff who would know better than anyone that it was a hotel mattress that none of the hotel windows open and that hotel cameras would have picked it all up the rush back to la and happy endings are pat forced and uninterestinglike a selfindulgent child the movie wants to have it both ways  the buddies are supposed to be relatable downtoearth guys yet somehow manage to reserve a 4500night luxury vegas villa come up with fancy clothes at will and all have hotlooking girlfriends wives fiancs or families the movie goes for cheap laughs early on by having the slob say he has to stay away by law from schools and parks yet later treats his carrying around a baby even making lewd gestures with its hand as all part of the fun the same tendency is true of the films use throughout of what it calls this fat man as a pratfalling publicly urinating punching bag turning him into an instant genius at cards his casual talk about using the drug ecstasy and the films use of slurs to describe the dorky dentist the hunk portrayed as a jerk and not in the least believable as a school teacher suddenly becomes a devoted family man at the end hanging all over his wife and son and later even carrying his sleeping son over his shoulder while he leers at cell phone pictures taken by one of his buddies of nude women they made out with in vegas as well as of the dentists bloody stupidly smiling face after drunkenly pulling out one of his front teeth that night on a dare the movie does not even manage to convey any genuine sense of joy to the adventures even as it seems to glorify them including lots of senseless destruction like trashing hotel rooms and cars someone getting shot an effeminate foulmouthed asian beating people with a tireiron the toothpulling etcadd to this these points recently made by a print reviewer about the movie i didnt think the was all that funny it was too choppy too meanspirited and too much of an ensemble that didnt fit together as well as it should have as to the embarrassingly uncritical pass roger ebert gave this movie like so many others it only reminds me why i always liked gene siskel so much better why sweat any of this its about drunken partying right identify with it go with the flow its not about making sense or taking anything seriously if that works for you fine maybe this is one of those movies where someone likes almost everything or almost nothing all a reviewer can do is explain why she feels one way or the other for the reasons discussed what is bad or weak about the movie so overwhelms anything good about it that the above excuses come across to this reviewer as just a convenient lame copout a copout here for failing to entertain in any meaningful sense of the word and in the process not merely disappointing but spoiling the time of plenty of people who were looking forward to a good time at the movies,comedy
for his bachelor party a man goes to vegas with his buddies hilarity ensuessort of the film tries very hard to to be funny but fails to deliver many laughs it is entertaining and provides enough amusement to keep it from dragging the script consists of a series of vignettes that dont all come together the way they do in the best comedies the sophistication level of the comedy is pretty low a step above the three stooges and there is a sense of dejavu to it all there is a vegas segment in the 1999 comedy go that is more amusing that anything here the main source of laughs here is the doofus brotherinlaw played by galifianakis,comedy
wow what a movie the was a brilliant portration of 4 best friends who go to las vegas for the groom doug billings played by justin bartha bachelor party 2 nights away from his big wedding day when they get to las vegas they get drugged and drunked on that night and the next day completely forgot what happened the night before and whats more the grooms missing in addition to that there is a tiger in the hotel room a baby in the closet a chinese man in the trunk of the car and the list goes on then the 4 friends who now are 3 go on a frantic chase to find their best mate who is supposed to get married the next day the adventure is just beginning as they get up to very mischievous activities the concept was simple but it was the characters that made it for me phil wenneck played by bradley cooper a school teacher who likes to be authorative and demeaning of everyone but has a soft side and at times can be sensitive and most of all he likes to have fun stu price played by ed helms the dentist nerd who is on the verge of proposing to his aggressive and mean girlfriendalan garner played by zach galifianakis the dimwitted brotherinlaw of the groom has no common sense but has a big heart and loves all his friendsand finallydoug billings played by justin bartha the nice hearted husband to be who everyone loves and gets along with however he goes missing after the boys infamous night in vegasall these characters created such a brilliant mastermind comedy the actors played them to perfection and no one overdid their character also credit has to go to the director tod phillips who in my opinion is the best director of comedy there is and lets not forget the brilliant screenwriters who made up this amazingly funny film jon lucas and scott moore the cinematography was beautiful as it captivated the hustle and bustle of the fantastic las vegas cityoverall this movie was comedic genius and the best part of the movie is the ending which explains everything that had put a question mark in your mind prior to the endinga must see film bring it on the 2,comedy
awesome moviego see itthis is the funniestcraziestwittiest movie i have ever seeni have seen it yesterday oncethe first timebut i feel will see it at least 56 times morei heard from my friends that it is a good movie but it turned out to be one of the best in its genre i was skeptical about it at first thinking that the previews would have only the funny parts but they are just the tip of the icebergi especially liked zach galifianakishe was simply superb through out the movieand hats off to todd philips for directing such a brilliant flickwe are all eagerly waiting for the sequel todd,comedy
this movie was brilliant on so many different levels it had humorous moments from almost every character which tends to be rare in most comedies there always tends to be one person that carries everyone else though zach alan was the most funny of the characters he did not carry the whole movie it was funny all around and i was very glad to see a good comedy this summer seeing as how land of the lost was somewhat lacking the had so many different things going on that it is a movie worth watching more than once i personally went to see this film twice and i will for sure be purchasing it when it comes to dvd this is a definite mustsee movie of the summer,comedy
i went to go see this film about a week ago not long after it released here in the uk and i have to admit i was expecting the usual comedy where the best parts are in the trailer that was not the casethe has got to be one of the funniest well written and comically genius movies of all time it will have you laughing from beginning to end and if you dont go see this you are definitely missing out everything that you want in a comedy you will get with this movie and then some im a big fan of eighties comedy when everything was new and unseen so i rarely find todays comedies as funny but this film has made it to the top of the list in my eyes and i will be very surprised if anyone doesnt love this movie as much as i do it will definitely be making it into my dvd collection and i may do something i hardly doi might go see it again at the cinemasamazing brilliant just when you think youve seen it all in comedy the blows everything out of the water,comedy
i saw this move last night for the 2nd time and can say without question this is the funniest movie of the year or possibly any other year where to begin give credit to the writers first and foremost because this was lol funny from start to finish and the storyline and dialog kept the comedy pace going throughout there werent any slow spotsthe acting was pitch perfect from the main characters to those with secondary roles including brief cameo appearances zach galifianakis in a breakthrough role was great as the goofy brotherinlaw to be ed helms was outstanding as the dentist buddy brad cooper also great as the hipster friend brief appearances by rob riggle as the cop matt walsh as the doctor at the hospital jeff tambor as the fatherinlaw mike tyson as himself and the wedding singer dan finnerty in one of the funniest bits in the movie he sings 50 cents candyshop and numerous others actors really contributed to the filmthe film also finished strong with a great ending that tied everything up nicely with the closing minutes the high point of the filma great movie an instant classic i would add cant wait for the dvd to come out,comedy
this movie is officially the funniest and best comedy i have ever seen ive never seen a movie that throughout the movie every at most 2 minutes i wouldnt laughfirstly im not gonna tell you any funny parts or quotes in the movie because its not fair 4 you but it wouldnt make much difference if i told you 5 or 6 parts because there is so many funny parts its hard to think of thembasically it beats all of my past favourite comedys by judd apatow although he is a genius in himself he just does not beat this movie all my past favourites like superbad my 2nd favourite comedy knocked up forgetting sarah marshall nd i love youman just are not as funny it is very hard 2 admit but it is simply just the best comedy ever if not in my top 5 movies of all timea must see nd a must buy,comedy
this is definitely one of the funniest movies since ages and for me it comes right after the 40 year old virgin and the big lebowsky which i consider as the funniest movies for men ever gladly all the stupid hollywood business as usual love stuff was left out of this one its full of surprises and not only a commercial copy of other successful comedies like so many others i have seen within the last 3 yearsi guess i will see it over and over when it comes out on dvd because i consider the music as slightly too commercial ill keep the last point for me and hope there will be a second part of this next year,comedy
yes its that good i just got out of the theater and instantly felt the need to write a gushing review for this moviethe premise free of any major spoilers is that four friends go to vegas on a bachelor party black out and lose the groom now this could have gone wrong in production since a simple recounting of the crazy events would have made a funny but very ordinary movie instead the movie focuses on the morning after and laugh after laugh results from seeing crazy sht that transpired in the last 14 or so hours including a tiger mike tyson and a naked angry asian mobster whose voice was stereotypically a bit reminiscent of kim jong il from team americaits the characters that really make this movie the groom doesnt really play that big a role the future brotherinlaw alan and the two best friends stuart and phil are hilarious alan is a weird and inappropriate guy that never fails to shock and produce hilarity with memorable comments like classic i find your language offensive and the wolf pack speech phil is a bit more of a clich but he fills the void of the necessary cool guy of the group who likes having a crazy time stuart is a neurotic kindofdorkbutnotreally someone you sympathize with because hes totally whippedin conclusion  i think this movie is a must see for anyone that enjoys this kind of humor there are no fart jokes for the lowest common denominator but there is an overload of genuinely witty banter and plot twists there are no clichd epiphanies or moralization its about a good time perhaps too good a time that went wrong thatll make you want to hop in your car and drive to vegas this movie really took a trite topic  the bachelor party  and turned it into a great plot great characters hilarious lines and a satisfying endingdefinitely a 10,comedy
the is what a comedy should be without being a bad movie all the ingredients of a good movie in general exist here and the film is just so so funnyand funny consistently there arent huge laughs followed by gaps of plot explanation or catch up or whatever the plot is essentially the comedy driven ingeniously by the actors there are almost no spots in the movie where you arent laughingand if and when you arent laughing you are only listening closely and anticipating the next laugh and you never worry if the bulk of the comedy is over it is nice to see a comedy that doesnt need judd apatow and company to make it a good one the leaves the sophistication at the studio and just brings laughs  some crude some stupid some witty some dark some insulting  but all worth seeing this hilarious comedy,comedy
this is definitely one of the best comedies ive seen in quite some time it gets you laughing in one way or another by being crude surprising shocking and just plain weirdthe movie is about four buddies heading off to vegas to have some fun before the groomtobe played by justin bartha of the national treasure movies most notably is to be wed the hijinks ensue the morning of the as they are left wondering what happened and how it happenedeach of our main four actors adds their own brand of humor to the movie but i thought ed helms and zach galifianakis stood out and made the movie especially funnyid definitely suggest one checks this movie out on video if not in the theaters but this movie earned its r rating so i wouldnt recommend letting the youngest of children watch it,comedy
to be honest after the way this movie has been built up i couldnt help but feel some disappointment as it wasnt as flat out falling down funny as i was hoping for thats not to say that there arent very lively moments and some genuine laughs to be had but this isnt really that great still its tremendous success is impossible to deny obviously it was a crowd pleaser what it does benefit from is a set of enthusiastic performances by its star trio bradley cooper as phil ed helms as stu and zach galifianakis as alan as three guys helping the abouttobemarried doug justin bartha have the last great wild time of his life in las vegas unfortunately what happens is on the day after they have no memory of the hell they raised all theyve got are the end results a tiger in the bathroom an adorable infant on the premises a hotel room in ruins a missing tooth stus apparent marriage to a stripper named jade heather graham looking as foxy as ever a stolen police carand most importantly the disappearance of the groom so theyre obliged to solve the whole mystery of the night before with often wacky results just to give you an idea boxing icon mike tyson playing himself turns up showing his appreciation for phil collinss in the air tonight some sequences work better than others  among other things the three guys find themselves roped into participating in a tasing demonstration and are pursued by a vengeful character named mr chow ken jeong todd phillips who gave us such other comedies as road trip and old school is director of these nutty shenanigans and the gags keep coming right through the end credits as we finally get to see through snapshots bits and pieces of the kinds of things that the guys got up to overall this is certainly lively stuff with enough chuckles to make for fine viewing and making the city of las vegas a character in its own right but for this viewer couldnt quite measure up to its reputation seven out of 10,comedy
nothing more then a deranged completely unashamed thrill ride of laughs this film delights itself in mocking teasing and outright twisting things that would normally be frowned upon if they were ever committed in real lifeshowing a fairly accurate portrayal of how things can get out of control in vegas the film follows the exploits of phil stu and alan three guys who one day go out on a stagnight to the city of sin itself before a wedding with groomtobe doug who goes missing the following day next morning leading to the three trying to piece together the events of what exactly happened during that crazy last night in which they were all tipsy and out of their mindscharacters swear like sailors propert is broken and smashed danger is made a complete laughing stock all put together to form one anacarhic and funny comedies i especially laughed at the pretending to k a tiger scene with the amount of raunchy jokes and a scene of full frontal male nudity this is definitely not one for the kids or grandparents,comedy
i can not remind myself that ive laughed this much for a long time everything from start to finish offers a wonderful blend of humor so i think everyone will find something they like in this movie its hard not to find a favorite character because all the characters have so many things to offerafter seeing this movie for the third time i think it has exactly the same charm as the first time i will probably look at it many more times in the future and that says a lot about the movie i recommend it to anyone who has not seen it and if its been a long time since you saw it watch it again its worth it,comedy
a las vegasset comedy centered around three groomsmen who lose their abouttobewed buddy during their drunken misadventures then must retrace their steps in order to find himnowadays as you should all know comedies and horror specifically have had clichd attempts at creating something funny or scary as do these all fail the man who brought us road trip and old school makes possibly one of the best comedies of the decade the premise is simplistic and clever youll feel as if your joined along with the gang and their misadventures through vegas the humor is top notch and each character has their own personal comedic aspects my favorite was personally zach galifianakis who has made a new debut in the film industry seeing how much these guys messed up and how they react to their mistakes it all turns out to be the funniest things ever the twist alan actually drugging the wolf pack was kind of stupid but it worked and i see of no other twist they couldve planned the acting was good and funny and im so glad how the gang wasnt those famous actors like johnny depp or leonardo dicaprio this meaning i loved how they chose some underrated actors and made them shine through similar to horrible bosses this controversial hilarious gritty humorousfilled trip will have you hungry for more of the wolf pack i highly enjoyed everything of the film to the humor and to the simple clever plot if your into todd philips work your more than likely to love the if your into comedy point black your more than likely to love the even if your not the biggest fan of each maybe the will take you by surprise with its no clichd funniness and i finalize my review with my salute to todd for creating yet again another comedy we can all laugh to better yet a comedy that takes away from the clichs and what not and creates a new breed of comedy 1010,comedy
the movie talks about a bachelor party gone wrong when the groom goes missing in the middle of las vegasthe characters are different and you can relate to each one you have the responsible yet loose doug the adventurous phil the adult stu and the sicko alanthe movie has its moments its funny at times but gets a little lame when its the same joke over and over again the ending was kind of shocking since it was sudden and out of the blue the way they found doughowever it was fun i enjoyed it and i will certainly be watching it again since it doesnt get old you should watch it too if you havent and if you did watch it again why not anyway,comedy
when i sat down to watch this i wasnt sure what to expect of the main cast the only actor whose name i recognised was bradley cooper and that was because id seen him in the tv show alias which is hardly a comedy the idea of a group of men going out for a stag night in las vegas led me to expect a fairly puerile story about what they got up to there and while the actual film was fairly silly it was also pretty funny and i enjoyed it a lot more than i expectedmost of the story is told in flashback after one of the group telephones the bride to be to let her know that they have lost the groom the rest of the film follows their adventures as they look for clues as to what happened on that fateful night this adventure will include a tiger in their bathroom a missing tooth one of them marrying a stripper stealing police car finding a naked chinese man in their cars boot and a meeting with mike tyson if that sounds fairly madcap it is because it is rather several scenes caused me to chuckle and some were laugh out loud funny the scene where they were children got to shoot the group with stun guns was hysterically funnythe acting was decent bradley cooper shows that he can do comedy as well as drama zach galifianakis was funny as the less than intelligent alan and ed helms was good as the henpecked dentist stu while some of the jokes missed the mark it was funny enough to be worth watching so long as you dont mind the adult tone of some of the jokes and a fair amount of swearing,comedy
the is a riot i did not think it would be this funny but it was it is outrageous entertaining crude vulgar and even offensive but man the best comedy in years the cast is brilliant especially zach galifianakis who has given the best performance of the year so far rachael harris was fantastic as such a bword the writing and direction are perfect it really seemed it came from judd apatow and i am glad that todd phillips still has some of the humor that he did in old school thank you todd phillips for making the best rrated comedy of the year and the funniest film in quite some time along with the horrorcomedy drag me to hellthe is quite a ride,comedy
two days before his wedding with the wealthy tracy garner sasha barrese doug billings justin bartha travels to his bachelor party in las vegas with his best friends the school teacher phil wenneck bradley cooper and the dentist stu price ed helms and tracys unconventional brother alan garner zach galifianakis tracys father lends his convertible mercedez benz that is his pride and joy to doug with many recommendations the quartet rents the best suite in the caesars palace and they go to the roof to celebrate alan proposes a toast to doug and they drink his booze on the next morning phil stu and alan have a and they do not recall what they did last night the room is upside down doug is missing there is a baby in the wardrobe a tiger in the bedroom a chicken in the room stu has a missing tooth and doug is missing the trio tries to track down last night to find what happened and sooner they discover that stu married the stripper jade heather graham and alan has spiked their booze with good morning cinderella in the beginning of their crazy night the is a hilarious comedy that slightly recalls the situations and pace of mystery date the story is very funny and the screenplay is unpredictable and full of action there are many joke and witty lines and all the characters are likable even the bad guys where they got that chicken is an unanswered question i only regret that the director did not show a scene with tracys father seeing his mercedez this is the type of movie recommended for a friday night after working along the whole week  the entertainment and laughs are guaranteed my vote is eighttitle brazil se beber no case if you drink do not marry,comedy
went to see it with my wife last week we laughed a little but there is nothing memorable in this film they seem like nice boys and the stuff wasnt too raunchy but nothing timeless or classic at allweekend at bernies bettercity slickers betteri could go on but why bothernone of the movies these days are very good the industry is collapsing there is a lack of good writing the actors are all boring the girls are pretty but thats not enough nothing is interesting in these movies any more,comedy
this movie is absolutely brilliant the plot the humour and the ending all create a brilliant movie  this movie had lots of twists to it which made it more enjoyable  the plot is about a a group of friends that all come to their friends wedding they have a bachelor party that goes out of control  the next morning they all wake up and have a but there are different things that have happened throughout the night that they cannot remember but there friend is missing so they go on a hilarious adventure to find him before the weddingi would recommend this to anyone who loves comedies and are not kids,comedy
one of the funniest comedies of the last yearsa group of friends get together to spend a weekend in las vegas at a bachelor party before the wedding of one of them what happens the morning after their first night in las vegas where none of them remembers what has happened the future groom is missing have a baby to take care of and a tiger to get ride off  is the beginning of the adventureits one of those hollywood comedies that uses well known comedy elements and gives them a an original irreverent twisti think its a great idea that we dont know what happened during the night at all so the craziness of the day gets the spectator intrigued and enjoying the development of the crazy events i loved the last minutes of the movie in which a sliding photo presentation tells the viewer in images what really happened that night putting everything into place and placing all the pieces of the jigsaw in their proper spacethe actors are all terrific funny charming and believable in their colorful and archetypal roles however are the script and the movie director the ones to be congratulated as it is thanks to them that the comedy is fresh truly funny and engaging without falling into vulgarity moreover and despite being a comedy full of men this is not an alfamale comedy the result is a cheeky irreverent and daring male comedy that will enthuse both men and womeni had an awesome time and i really laughed which doesnt happen that often with comedies lately,comedy
when i first heard about the i thought wow this movie is going to suck then i saw something that told me that the was a box office smash and i suddenly decided to give the movie a try best decision i have made on a movie in my lifeit has the typical group of friends when there is a wedding the crazy one alan zach galifianakis the one that is going to tell you that you are making the biggest mistake of your life phil bradley cooper and the one who isnt allowed to do anything because he is whipped ed helms what is so great about this film is it takes a normal thing a bachelor party and gives it a twist a the acting is amazing the script is amazing and the plat is amazing which adds up to be an amazing film,comedy
as far as wedding movies go the is a tad different from others in the genre we are not asked to follow the antics of these grown up men getting in all kinds of mischief while trying to celebrate the ritual of a bachelor party in las vegas as a matter of fact the film spare us of all that as the creators take us to watch the effects of the night in question as three of the four friends have to face the consequences of their night on the town the american male shows signs of wanting to remain children for as long as they can phil stu and alan wanted to give their pal doug a night he would not forget bringing him to caesars palace in las vegas was a sort of adventure for these foursome when doug the groom to be disappears after a night on the town the remaining trio decide to retrace their steps to find him obviously they have no clue as to where to begin alan discovers there is a tiger in the bathroom as well as a baby hidden in an unexpected place stu finds to his horror he is missing a front toothas the friends try to put together the pieces about the disappearance of doug they get into more trouble when a gang of thugs led by a gay chinese man begin to pressure them for eighty thousand dollars he claims alan stole from him stu learns he got married at one of those ubiquitous chapels that dot las vegas whats more he has married a hooker the mother of the child found in their suite as for the tiger it belongs to no other than mike tyson a tough guy to deal with their erratic ways bring him to despair but no dougtodd phillips directed this entertaining comedy with sure hand the screenplay by jon lucas and scott moore is not the bythenumber kind although fans of the genre will find similarities with other movies about weddings that are disastrous for starters the creators have kept from the audience everything related to what really happened on the night of the bachelor party we only see shots of what they really did in snapshots as the credits rollzach galifianakis is turning into an impressive presence wherever he appears we admired his work in the series bored to death he proves he is a funny man that does not mind baring it all for a laugh bradley cooper is the leader of the friends but actually he is the straight man ed helms on the other hand goes from the nerd type he is supposed to be into a new man changed when he married the hooker rachael harris who plays melissa stus terrorizing lover is an actress that has been around in small roles and really deserves to play more often she excels as the henpecking melissa the woman that twotimes stu with the bartender of a cruise ship and who makes his life impossible jeffrey tambor has only a small part,comedy
my goodnessthis movie is hilarious this is my 3rd film in the slew of summer films that i am bound to see and it delivered it has exactly the right proportion of sophomoric violent vulgar and charming comedyim sure none of these actors are newcomers but i had never seen any of them in a blockbuster film but they all delivered after watching this film youll definitely want to start planning your next trip to vegas i would recommend this film for a guys night out a girls night out or just a good old date film if youre not too squeamish stay to watch the creditsyoull definitely say to yourself can they show that in a rated r film,comedy
doug justin bartha is about to walk down the aisle with a beautiful lady tracy sasha barrese therefore his pals are taking him to vegas for a big bachelor bash these include schoolteacher phil bradley cooper businessman stu ed helms and dougs soontobe brotherinlaw alan zach galifianakis freespirit phil is trying to loosen everyone up for doug is less than adventurous stu is hogtied to his girlfriend from hades melissa who thinks they are going to napa valley for a wine tasting and alan is a chubby consummate weirdo the friends arrive at the hotel and go up on the roof for a toast thats the last thing they remember for in the morning they wake up in a daze a tiger is in their bathroom a baby boy is in the kitchen and doug is missing what happened inbetween and why cant they remember as they try to piece things together while taking care of the little lad they have encounters with the korean mafia mike tyson a hooker who is sporting stus grandmothers ring and more will they find doug in time for him to make it to the ceremony this film is very clever and very funny sending most of the audience into a bellyache of laughter however it is definitely on the raunchy side which some filmgoers will find offensive you definitely dont want to mention in sunday school class that you saw it the cast is nice with cooper and bartha quite fine as the two friends and the lesser cast members are great too but stealing the show are helms and galifianakis for they are funny beyond words and create very memorable characters in stu and alan respectfully the scenery in vegas is glitzy while the costumes camera work and other film amenities are very fine most importantly great applause should be extended to the devilishly clever script and the rapidfire direction that does not mean however that drug use excessing drinking and other unsavory practices will seem funny to everyone but all in all unless you are supremely hungover and have your head in the toilet you would do well to head to the cinema for this one all you comedy seekers it is a laugh riot period adios sayonara,comedy
the director todd phillips country usa year 2009 language english runtime 100 minutes rating 16i like my comedies brash and loud i like to find my self choking on popcorn and shooting cocacola through my nose i like to laugh out loud and so dumb  dumber 1994 is most definitely my kind of comedybecause of this i also loved the flood of films starring fratpackers vince vaughan ben stiller and the wilsons i laughed my ass off at dodgeball 2004 wedding crashers 2005 and old school 2003 which was directed by todd phillipsso i had high hopes for the the latest film from phillips a new comedy about a bachelor party that goes horribly wrongthe basic premise is this two days before his wedding doug and his three buddies drive to vegas for a blowout night theyre hoping that theyll never forget but when the three groomsmen wake up the next morning with pounding headaches they realise theyve just spent a night theyll never remember their posh hotel suite is beyond thrashed with a wee baby in one room and of all things a tiger in another but worse than that the groom is no where to be foundwith no clue as to what happened and little time to spare the trio must attempt to retrace their steps and relive their bad decisions from the night before in order to figure out where things went so drastically wrong and hopefully get doug back to la in time for his weddinghowever the more they begin to uncover the more they realise just how much trouble theyre really inthe film is already a monumental hit in the us taking in more than 40 million in its opening weekend alone more than double what was expected the movie soared on extremely positive word of mouth that started first as a trickle from previews and then turned into a torrent as the audience who saw it on friday and saturday told their friends who flooded the cinema screens on the sundaybut is it any good hell yes it is when the three groomsmen awake they lurch from one hilarious situation to another its a wickedly smart film and manages to mix the very lowest of the lowbrow comedy to wondrous effect its rude raucous raunchy and ribtickling funny the comedy is brilliantly written the characters are wonderfully played and the situations while contrived are seldom less than hilarious if youre a fan of the movies listed above then youll love this,comedy
in rough times like these we need a good comedy to make us laugh and put a smile on our faces the is that movie its a raunchy rowdy crazy good time featuring everything from retro mercedes to mike tyson so far its easily the best film ive seen all yearthe story revolves around a trip to las vegas gone wrong which sometimes works fear and loathing in las vegas and sometimes dosent what happens in vegas two best friends the cool schoolteacher phil bradley cooper and the nerdy dentist stu ed helms along with the brides brother alan zach galifianakis wake up in their room in caesars palace with no recollection of what happened the night before which they spent having a wild bachelor party for their friend doug justin bartha turns out theres a tiger in the bathroom a baby in the closet stus missing a toothand for reasons unexplained theres a chicken in the kitchen and oh yeah dougs nowhere to be found the three race around sin city searching for the groom where more crazy stuff starts happening when the valet brings their car its a police car stu is married to a stripper heather graham beautiful as ever they apparently had a run in with a mean gangster ken jeong they went to mike tysons house the list goes on and on each misadventure produces more hilarity than the lastthe cast is pretty much a poor mans judd apatow without the cheap love story sandwiched in yes knocked up and the 40 year old virgin were classics but turned slowly into chick flick territory most of the guys you know you have seen but just cant put a name to a face helms best known as rainn wilsons rival on the office plays the role of stu perfectly he plays the delusional stu with great humor especially when he goes crazy on the others as the closest thing to a lead cooper is the laid back guy who tries to keep everyone under control hopefully more lead roles are headed his way galifianakis plays the annoying alan with perfect poise that when he when he dosent fret over the tiger when he first sees it you just have to wonder why no one discovered him until now barthas screen time is reduced due to the fact hes missing for half the film but he does his job well and manages to crack some good ones before he goes missing there are some enjoyable cameos by mike epps tyson and jeffrey tambor that will keep you laughing as welloverall the is one of the funniest films ive ever seen and as i said earlier the best ive seen all year a sequel is already being written but im not sure if i want it but knowing these guys if they could make a comedy about anything id probably watch it,comedy
the making of the someone said you know whats funny s lolol you know what would be really funny waking up with a tiger in your bathroom lolololol even funnier a baby too lolololol in las vegas lolololololol reverse engineer story involving mike tyson a prostitute and a funny little asian man insert additional stupidity profitthis might be a childish analysis of the but in my opinion it really doesnt deserve much better as one of the other reviewers said this is the premiere bachelor party movie meaning youll enjoy it much more if youre drunk and being stupid couldnt hurt also admittedly the movie has funny parts namely zach galifiankis aka alan who is always this brand of funny but seriously this is not the best comedy ever as many will have you believe waking up in the morning after watching this movie i had a headache nausea sensitivity to light and noise lethargy dysphoria diarrhea and thirst too bad i could still remember this terrible ridiculously overhyped movie,comedy
i do not understand why this movie was so overrated it is loaded with clich after clich bachelor party at las vegas check fat retarded cousin whos also a math genius that can count cards and beat vegas check got married with a hooker in vegas and woke up without remembering it check tiger locked up in hotel room check stole a police car check a small asian guy in the trunk check p ssed off the head of mafiagangtriad check cameo appearance of mike tyson check get punched by mike tyson check i bet the director also had some midgets and shemales in it before cutting it out just wait for the extended version its basically a tribute to all the bad comedies in the history of hollywood if you find peeing in mike tysons pool is funny this movie is for you the humor is just very juvenile the target audience is north american male preferably a meat head between the age of 17 to 35 it is not very offensive by any means it is just not too creative if you think bizarre is creative then it is very creative because it is loaded with bizarre incidences that needs no explanation other than some alcohol and some drug i hope young kids dont think drug is so much fun after seeing this movie it somewhat glorifies drug use in a goofy way yeah see all the fun experience we had and we ended up just fine,comedy
like many others who has commented this movie i must agree that my relation to imdb is damaged everybody knows that a movie like this normally floats around 5 in rating around 67 if its a really good comedy the floats around 8 and a half at the moment that seems really much for a film that didnt deliver anything near the last years great comedys they all float around 7 to 7 and a half this comedy had nothing new about it the only funny thing was when alan sad he had plans for next weekend cause the jonas brothers where in town i guess this movie and the jonas brothers target the same crowd the saddest thing about this film is that hollywood is making a sequel,comedy
it raised a smile once or twice but the rest of it was predictable highschool humour about a bunch of unlikeable men being ridiculously irresponsibleone stupid mistake leads to a series of stupid mistakes and it goes on and on and on ad nauseum you dont need me to explain the plot  its all there in the trailersnoone in the cast was particularly good except maybe for heather graham given the limited scope of the script she at least was kind of likable even if she veered into stereotype 40 of her screen timenow i can understand why young people would like this unable to summon up the courage or the cash to pull this sort of crap themselves they would enjoy living through this farce vicariously i am fairly sure it will only serve to embarrass them in 10 years time the same way porkys did for my generationit is unfortunate that this low level of creativity and poor humour can pull big audiences but maybe this is the net result of the dumbingdown of mainstream cinema over the last 20 years bumsonseats can please the shareholders and accountants but its a lousy motivation for any sort of artform,comedy
ive read a lot of positive reviews on the but managed to get  only a few laughs while watching it not much of entertainment  originality surprise and most importantly humour at the end of it i  was left with the suspicion that the whole thing was a badly made  commercial for the vegas blvd and having spent more than a month there  i am telling you it is not worth it unless you enjoy the cheap bling  of the concrete hotels and plastic hookers  what surprised me the most was the high score on imdb 79 form roughly  120000 users by the time i submit this review that easily surpasses  my comedy favourite for 2009  funny people cmon imdb you are losing  it  honestly you have to be of the intellectual capacity of mike tyson to  enjoy this one,comedy
i read a review in usa today comparing this movie with three men and a baby hey i thought i liked 3 men and a baby ill go to see thisbiiiig mistake you have to look very very hard for similarities between those two films this was much more in the style of road trip or for those old enough to remember them the american pie filmsi have to say the acting was pretty good some of the characters are intended to be unlikeable and boy did i dislike them trouble was i found i had almost no interest in whether they succeeded or failed in their mission and the events that unfolded in the film were meant to be increasingly outrageous but i just found them increasingly beyond belief forget about the baby this is about three men being juvenile the socalled humour comes in watching them suffer hahanot,comedy
the 2009  bradley cooper ed helms zach galifanakis justin bartha heather graham sasha barrese jeffrey tambor ken jeong rachael harris mike epps rob riggle cleo king bryan callen matt walsh cameo as himself mike tyson uproariously raunchy buddyroadtrip comedy with four pals en route to las vegas for a bachelor party for groomtobe bartha but results in an aftermath of epic proportions of not recollecting any events of the debauchery that has led them to the titular condition of mistaken identity a criminal element a baby and the missing groom the inspired lunacy of comic trio cooper the brash vince vaughn part helms the geeky ben stiller bit and especially the hilarious galifinakis in a one for the film vault turn that rivals john belushi busting onto the screen in animal house it is that memorable is worth the price less admission for a howlingly funny comedy instant classic with a truly uproarious screenplay by jon lucas  scott more and todd phillips who continues his traditional skeevy cameo is heir apparent to ivan reitman one of the years funniest comedies and one of the funniest comedies ever,comedy
the acting was all quite good and the storys start looked very promisingbut going into this movie my accompaniment and i both had high hopes for it throughout the first 1530mins things were looking promising but immediately things took a turn for the worst one sadly pathetic scene after anotherthe acting was still alright but the plot had no strength to it and did not nearly live up to the hype which surrounded itlikegoing to try a pricey restaurant and receiving one scallop as an 12 appetizer and a steak half the size of your fist for 30though i do enjoy each actor in their own respect no matter how well any of them acted the plot every bit of storyline was so terrible to see this movie would quite possibly be the biggest waste of your recorded time on this planet as of yet,comedy
when the movie was first released and i saw the trailer i wasnt impressed after it was released on dvd and i saw that 90000 imdb users had rated it at 80 i thought maybe i missed something and should give it a chance i did give it a chance i didnt miss anything wow what a waste of time there were a few jokes and a few situations that hit the mark but mostly it left my group shaking our collective heads and wishing we could have that hour and a half of our lives back the premise was promising 3 friends plus an oddball brotherinlaw in vegas for a bachelor party although for most of the time its just 3 since the groomtobe goes missing that goes awry but out of the 3 remaining prominent characters only 2 of them are interesting on any level bradley coopers school teacher is supposed to be the straightman in the group that plays off the wackiness of the others but he adds no comedic value and the other 2 arent wacky enough with a few exceptions to be funny on their own,comedy
i dont get it i just dont get it why is this film so popular why does it make so much money why does it have such a high rating maybe im a humorless schmuck then again maybe its everybody elsewhen i watched the i was indefinitely expecting a hilarious movie especially given how much my friends seemed to adore it well you know what i left the theater wondering what all the fuss was about by that i mean i was wondering how such a crass stupid humorless piece of crap could garner so much attention the good the concept is original and has potential the movie features a korean actor the casting crews way of keeping the movie relevant to those of oriental backgroundthe badthe jokes  there doesnt really seem to be any the movie relies predominately on zany scenarios mostly involving some form of gross out humor brutal injury and a verbal assault of out of place cursing seriously since when is the death of a minister supposed to be funny if thats the case then the videos of 911 are downright hystericalthe rrated content  the film contains a lot of attempts to shock its audience which i guess the idiots interpret as funny i dont know this includes a foul mouthed wedding singer making a baby look like it is masturbating and a naked man jumping out of the trunk of a car and beating the protagonists you just cant find quality writing like this anymorepointless gratuitous porny shots  movie has a fair amount of unnecessary nudity including nipple shots naked me whether you care about this is really dependent on whether youve graduated high school yet and to top off such a well crafted movie we get a slideshow during the credits  basically an excuse to show softcore porn to the audience classyso as you can probably tell i hate this movie and that is all that she wrote i guess1 out of 10,comedy
this movie is typical juvenile hollywood trash unfortunately the major target demographics of movie makers are boys and girls in their early teens girls have their cheesy vampire stories boys either have mindless blow them up action flicks or well unfunny fbomb flicks like thistheres not an ounce of original thought or humour in this movie characters are unlikable undeveloped badly acted sometimes over sometimes under and except for three maybe four completely unnecessary the groom being one of the unnecessary onessome movies are so bad they are good this is not one of those honestly i think it deserves 212 maybe 3 stars so its not memorable in any shape of form im giving it one to balance the ridiculously high score did everyone who watched this movie check their brains at the door,comedy
the apparently swept the country touted as the funniest film ever made and indeed the proof of its success lies in the fact that the 2 is in postproduction so there is more on the way the question arises more what apparently resting on the information gathered from television sitcoms and other raunchy potty mouth movies like borat etc there is an audience for films that pose middle aged men as men in their 20s performing acts that are more like boys in their misbegotten teens it is amazing that these films that put down african americans like the manipulation of mike tyson and the dumb drug dealer character black doug portrayed by mike epps and asian americans like the foolish overthetop fop of mr chow by jen keong etc etc etc are not confronted but then it may appear that all is fair in cinema comedy the premise is that four friends go to las vegas for a bachelor party before the wedding of the most mild of them all bradley cooper a teacher ed helms a dentist zach galifianakis the obese mentally disturbed brother of the bride and justin bartha the groom to be spend one lost night of doped drunken misadventures and wake up in an hotel suite with a chicken a tiger a mess s and amnesia and a missing groom the remainder of the film is simple the antics of these broken down individuals attempting to find the groom and to right some infractions of behavior is that funny well apparently to the vast number of people who see this film it is so here comes the next installment in what will likely be a long line of grossout sequels meanwhile the beautiful adult movies languish in oblivion to this weve come grady harp,comedy
i realize comedy is subjective and it is hard to convince someone whos laughing that the gag he just guffawed over isnt really funny so to be helpful to those debating whether to see it or not i offer this if you found the movie sideways unfunny and overrated you will probably find this one unfunny and overrated as well both feature the same inattention to the most essential ingredient in comedy timing both feature mostly unlikeable characters both are basically boringsome here have criticized the as racist sexist or just gross if done right such politically incorrect ingredients dont prevent me from laughing and sometimes they actually enhance a comedy if done right but those ingredients are not funny just in and of themselves the brought me one or two mild laughs the rest was just gross or otherwise offensive without any imagination behind it there are no i cant believe they just did that laughs here the gags are stale and occasionally cruel and the characters are unsympathetic im stunned at the popularity of this garbage,comedy
i just watched the movie and cant see what people find as funny the movie was crude fine i have no problems with crude humor actually will roar in laughter at it it just has to be funny i kept waiting for the funny parts of this movie to happen a guy using the toilet while a tiger keeps roaring to get his attention wait it is working the guy keeps peeing while he turns to notice the tiger yes that got a huge roar of laughter from the crowd they meet up with a girl the one guy unknowingly married her the night before okay the joke is coming she says she is a dancer then corrects herself and says she is actually a prostitute that was the joke hear the crowd roar i kept waiting for her to do something funny come on get crude i dont care just make it funny i dont know how much you can say on this site but the friends tell the guy his wife is the one who cheated on him he said it was alright because the guy didnt for censorship reasons deposit dna inside the woman yes it was filthy didnt offend me but didnt make me laugh either i just hope that we dont get into a wave of films just making a rude comment to get a laugh without it actually having to be funny,comedy
for the life of me i do not know why this pathetic excuse for a film even made a million let alone becoming one of the biggest hits of the year this is the first movie i have ever seen that i have walked out of i left with a little less then a half hour to go you dont have to eat a whole apple to know that its a rotten one a good analogy for this pathetic film it does not have anything resembling intelligence humor or style these three guys are so stupid and unlikeable that you dont give a damn about them or if they find their friend that is the first rule for liking a film you have to care about the characters there was a friend who saw this film who said it was junk and told me to stay away from it and boy i wish i had listened this movie is an insult to the intelligence of every intelligent moviegoer,comedy
the worst comedy ive seen in the last year the talented cast is wasted especially heather graham on this unoriginal script filled with shallow stereotypes bradley cooper struts through the movie as a completely unlikable goodlooking jerk who has no problems cheating on his wife and ignoring his son while in vegas the other actors are mostly forgettable and poor heather graham is wasted in her cameo role how this ever got nominated for a golden globe and how it won is obviously a bit of a back room bargain and payoff with hollywood foreign press because the film is not funny i only laughed once during the whole thing and that was the tiger in the car scene its sad when mike tysons tiger is funnier then the entire rest of the cast im glad i did not waste 1000 bucks seeing this at the show this is a rental and no more this makes porkys and weekend at bernies 2 look like the godfather dont waste your time,comedy
i got to the after everyone else had already seen it told me how brilliant it was told me their favourite bit and told me to get around to going to see it having been burnt many times before though i did not let this praise make me have any grand expectations and i came to it just hoping that it would be funny and it was i had some good laughs and plenty of chuckles throughout the film  enough to enjoy it right through from the setup to the pictures over the end credits whether i would be able to enjoy it for a second viewing though im not so surethe reason for this is that many of the laughs came from the sudden nature of the comedy  whether it be a sudden physical act or the unexpected nature of a line it is a slightly childish type of comedy with lots of people getting hurt in funny ways and this only has so much of an appeal to me like the oriental gambler says its funny because hes fat and that does rather sum up why some of the film is funny this is not to take away from some of the very funny lines and scenarios that the film comes up with but i still did think that the majority of my laughs would be dissipated if i had known what was coming as i would with a second viewing the flow of the story works a little bit against it as well in some regards it has a good mystery structure to it but then again the central concept means that in too many scenes we have to listen to a character explain that they have no memory etc etc fortunately it is mostly funny enough to cover up this clunky repeated problemthe cast really help the comedy by their delivery although he is not really that well known in the uk the office us not being a big show here helms was the standout for me in a character with elements of his andy in there i found him very funny and with a great sense of timing galifianakis is pretty good as well although he has a simpler character in many ways cooper is not quite as good with the comedy but he is a good presence in the film and plays off the others particularly helms well the various comic characters in support include mostly funny turns from graham jeong riggle and of course mike tysonin summary the will be loved by the majority of the target audience but is fastpaced and funny enough to please the casual viewer it may not stand up to repeat viewings due to the nature of some of the laughs but it good fun without too much reliance on crudity or basic pratfalls,comedy
simply put the gets everything right first the movie is hilarious second the direction script and comedic timing are spot on this is one of those movies that guys in their 30s and 40s can relate to very easily so many of us have either been in or known friends whove been in situations like this only to relive these experiences later in life as our you wont believe it story as someone who rarely takes time to comment on films i have to say what a great job to the director and all the other cast and crew for really getting all the elements to come together so well from the choice of actors to the cinematography editing and score this film made me laugh over and over again while appreciating how well all the talented folks who worked on this movie did such an outstanding job i cant remember when ive gone to see a movie more than once and ive seen this one 5 times this is extremely rare for me dont wait for the dvd go see it now but i will buy the dvd i cant wait to see the deleted scenes and extras like director commentary on this thank you for making a classic,comedy
i just joined imdb then felt i wanted to join the naysayers with this terrible movie i was curious because it seems to be one of those love it or hate it things god a lot of movie critics even rate it highly in the first half hour its not funny once not even a little bit funny makes u wonder about yr fellow man ben elton is funny john cleese is funny as basil fawlty benny hill robin williams even these guys are just horrible okay i have to say more need ten lines well it is not a movie one would bother critiquing one movie critic said it was funny line by line i guess line by line you could have different responses u could grimace one line groan the next look puzzled maybe perhaps at the least worst lines yr grimace might segue into a bitter smile the sort of look clint eastwood might have when looking at a massacre hey but im a glutton 4 punishment ill keep going and see if i can find one amusing thing in the whole shebang next 2nd movie i review im gonna love,comedy
what a boring contrived piece of crapthis is not for kids and yet it was written for the immature or teenage audience zach galifianakis is the most unfunniest person with the acting ability of a silent movie actor who just learned they have talkies available pissing on the floor and chucking a used condom around is not funny its frankly predictable and boring the only good performance was that of ed helms but even his acting ability couldnt save the script that could have been so much better based on a half decent idea i would have punched alan until his brains splattered all over the ground and i would have tasered phils balls until they burst into flames before l could be happy about watching these losers in a moviedo not let teenagers watch this movie,comedy
i must say im a big fan of todd philip movies every movie he makes has got something new and different to offer so was expecting nothing less from but surprisingly this one surpasses all his previous moviesbradley copper has perfectly played his part of a person trying to bring the situation under control by any meanszack has been immensely funny so has been the other characters everyone played their part perfectlythe casino scene was hilarious and the one in police station too falls under  one of the funniestthe background score was properly doneeven the candy shop song too strikes a cord with the audienceso i suggest everyone to go to your nearest cinema hall and get yourself a ticket i assure you that you wont be disappointed,comedy
like our intrepid protagonists i think somebody drugged me before seeing the this is the only possible explanation for why i found this movie so terrible while critics and audiences alike seem to rave about it there were maybe two funny jokes in the entire movie in between the offensive portrayals of minorities women and gays the screenwriters managed to fulfill every 12yearold boys supposed fantasies heartofgold strippers hijinks with a tiger a painfully unfunny mike tyson cameo and the egregious use of tasers among other overused tropes tyson aside im guessing the director thinks that because the audience has in the past enjoyed scenes with tasers the mere use of them in the movie instantly makes them funny not sowhat this movie lacked was everything that a successful film possesses likable or at least sympathetic characters some semblance of a realistic or at least internally consistent plot line and an ending that satisfies or at least relieves the audiences journey instead we get four unsympathetic idiotic unfunny characters the conceit of piecing together a drunken wild night out could be funny  could be  but none of the jokes are funny,comedy
im astonished by the high ratings and the positive feedback this movie has been getting the characters are unlikeable childish and brash while still remaining painfully uninteresting and generic their drunken adventures are so over the top you cant help but shaking your head and wonder what the writers and the producers were on when they greenlighted such a mess of a movie i mean we expect outlandish adventures from four drunken guys in vegas but what they go through in the movie is so ridiculous it requires an insane amount of suspension of disbelief to vaguely buy into the possibility of such events happeningor are we supposed to believe you can pretty much thrash a very expensive suite at the ceasars palace without getting caught nobody asked questions about the bed on the roof and since when can you sneak a freaking tiger in and out of a luxury hotel without anyone noticing not to mention the stolen police car and the ludicrous taser scenebut all those loopholes could have been forgiven had the movie been genuinely funny instead it was a predictable sequence of trite gags and jokes so old even your 9yearsold cousin has already heard them before the only first in the movie is the cringeworthy babyismasturbating gag repeated twice in case you missed it the first time or didnt find it offensive enough stay classythe characters have no redeeming qualities so theres no empathy and its really hard to care about them finding the missing friend making it back to the wedding or dying in the middle of the deserta special mention to zach galifianakises character seriously the moronic and awkward manchild isnt funny its just annoying the fascination hollywood has with such character is baffling although probably it represents a fair portion of the core audience for unfunny and inane flicks like the bottom line if youre not into lowquality 4th grade toilet humour andor into road trips involving adults with a mental age lower than their shoe size just avoid this movieor use it as the measuring stick for your friends skills in movierecommending if some of them speaks highly of the never follow his advice about another movie ever,comedy

now i have seen the twice n im still not able to understand why this movie is rated so high in fact american pie was better there was nothing to laugh about there wasnt a scene i can remember now what was there to laugh about the tiger in the bathroom or alen married to a sexworker it aint a good film et al i found pink panther very entertaining and its rated 51its really a mad mad mad mad world i hope these kinda poor sense of humor movies dun come in the near futurewaste of time now i really am in a i had to see snatch several times to feel bettertodd philips disappointed this time,comedy
so ive heard many good things about this film i was told that it would be one of the funniest films that ive ever seen ive heard people say that its outstanding and some people have said that its the best comedy of the past decade so i thought i should watch it to see how good it is i dont really regret watching it but to be honest that was long droning monotony i enjoyed the storyline and some bits were quite amusing but i merely grinned at it how this gets 78 ill never know because the point of a comedy film is to make me laugh but really the only thing that was keeping me watching was the fact that the storyline wasnt actually too bad hence i gave it a five this might be the definition of an average film massively overrated,comedy
the 2009  should be hung drawn and quartered i unfortunately had the misfortune of watching this film on dvdthe baby scenes are vile both visually and mentally violating for any intellectually receptive audience whose cognitive skills and abilities are above age 7 and since when were babies capable of choosing their own acting roles especially roles that depict infant masturbation and child molestation as comical babies are not sexually developed adults and are supposedly under the protection of their parents or guardians or the state any scene that tries to deliver the concept of humour being present when making fun of masturbating a baby is sadly deranged i think that scene should carry a jail sentence for humouring the crime of sexually abusing children the mere suggestion of masturbating a baby in front of your friends is not possible as humour not under any circumstances is this ever ethical moral or socially acceptable there is nothing comical about these scenes they only serve to fuel more baser minds and contribute to this disturbing problem by desensitising what little public awareness there is regarding sexual abuse of children and clearly ignores the victims the actual adults who were abused as children how can these baby scenes sit legally and legitimately as comedythe film may have been the usual stereotypical formulation for its target market were it minus the baby scenes i switched it off and vomited,comedy
if belly laughs are what you are after there are plenty of them in this film the plot is simple four lads go to vegas for a stag night the following morning their room is a mess and the groom is missing and they have no memory of the night before they have to retrace their steps to find the groom before the wedding the following day that sounds like a routine gross out comedy which in many ways it is most of the characters are straight out of clichs the hen pecked nerd the married guy who wants to cut loose for once and the groom who wants to have a good time but not overdo things so soon before the wedding there are some very funny scenes and unexpected plot twists to keep your attentionundoubtedly for me the highlight of the performance of zach galifianakis as the brotherinlaw to be he is subtle and very funny as the unclichd and downright weird alan he also gets the best conversation stopping onelinersid recommend this to a mainly male audience the female characters arent developed at all and are there only to move the plot along an alternative title might be how the lads got away with acting the eejit in vegas a shocking waste of the lovely heather graham unfortunately so its not shakespeare but i laughed a lot,comedy
the trailers for this looked so good so when i saw it in theaters i was extremely disappointed i was ashamed at all of those who were involved with this project and the fact that 35 million dollars went straight down the toilet i didnt laugh once while watching this dismal piece of garbage this is probably the most unimportant and overrated comedy ever made dont believe any of the hype you may hear because the 78 rating is far from accuratenow i enjoy stupid comedies and buddy flicks but this movie fails on every single level its pretty obvious that they ripped off the plot of dude wheres my car a good comedy and replaced it with vegas proving that they cant even get the story right just because mike tyson is present doesnt automatically make it funny when a naked asian guy jumps out of a car that doesnt automatically make it funny either this movie was so painful to watch that i ignored the sequelsthe writing sucks every joke fall flat the characters are onedimensional gag machines and worst of allthe movie is not funny they rely too much on shock value with zero buildup or punchline humor is entirely based on situations and timing two things this movie messed up on if you want to see a comedy thats actually funny watch dumb  dumber instead of this ridiculous rubbish,comedy
ill never understand how this movie was a success i never will the entire movie was a pointless waste of time and i almost walked out before the ending how could this be a box office hit it is so stupid there is not a funny part in the movie isnt it supposed to be a comedy well it isnt i hate to tell you this but the movie is dumb the movie is dull the movie is pointless ive never had a but i rather would instead of watching this film again there are some people who think that this movie is awesome or good i dont even know why they made a sequel to it how dumb can that be but i have seen the movie from start to finish once and never will again if you havent seen it dont waste your time it isnt worth it,comedy
tonight i had a double feature at my theatre and saw this along with land of the lost this movie is extremely funny and had a great storyline with great actors that baby was adorable doug is going to be married in two days so his friends phil stu and alan take him to vegas for his bachelor party the next day they wake up and cant remember anything about the night before find a baby and cant find doug they get into crazy misadventures trying to figure out what happened arrested by the police figure out who the baby belongs to and try to find their friend before the wedding i highly recommend the ,comedy
this piece of crap the writers and actors should be shot homophobic humor condones and incites antigay violence if antiblack slurs had been used in this movie the way antigay slurs were this movie would never have been released its this kind of antigay culture that leads to gay teen suicides its not funny its not ok if i ever meet the writers or the cast in person i swear i will punch them in the face they deserve to be shot let them say all the other slurs too got one for jews i do got one for italians theres one of those too how about women koreans japanese indians developmentally disabled slurs kill and if there is any justice all the assholes connected with this movie will get theirs too,comedy
i didnt like this movie which wasted my time it was like a 90 minute beer commercial featuring dumb male football fans the plot is preposterous and nonfunny the characters are jerks one unhappily married guy keeps lying to his wife one guy is knocked cold by mike tyson the group doesnt know where theyve been and run around in a stolen police car pay ransom to an asian gang etc plot silly acting poor not an inspiration for young people irrisponsible a good film requires either romance adventure conflict mystery or comical talent none of these ingredients will be found here dont bother with this one in order to meet the required ten lines ill add another review requiring ten lines of comment without making this a spoiler id idiotic thinking and ill probably never use this movie site again,comedy
i use the f word on occasion i like curb your enthusiasm which is loaded with curses and pretty bad ones but they dont seem to gratei mean really really grate the dialogue assault was like a jet engine in your living room for pain to your ears other than that the plot was totally juvenile and pitifully inane i can only think the people who liked this movie are the same people who poop on the seats of public toilets i dont understand the amusement they got from this flick change 2 letters from the last word and that is the word the director would have insisted on solely for the sake of saying it for the 1400th time really it was painful and strangely enough we are probably not allowed to use the most common language of the movie to review the movie if we were i probably would use it to make a point even lenny bruce could not have saved this fk thats short for flick of course and i am not lol about anything to sum it up a people rate this flick highb i really dont understand people,comedy
i heard from two people i know the was an incredibly funny movie so when my girlfriend suggested we see it i said ok maybe my expectations were too high but i laughed at most 56 times there were some truly offensive and very unfunny parts the crowded theater found hilarious you have to be concerned about our society when this passes for entertainment im sorry but liberal use of the f word does not make a scene humorous i rate it a 5 because it is one of the many lame and average attempts at humor hollywood has released over the years the fact that it currently ranks at 130 of all time over the likes of animal house and something about mary is truly puzzling,comedy
i absolutely loved this movie strange as it may be out of all the movies ive seen this year at the cinema this is now my highest rated film and i like to see at least one movie per week without a doubt this is the funniest movie that ive seen in years it starts with a constant chuckle as they establish each character and then kicks it in to high gear perfectly structured and purely hilarious this film throws one outrageous situation after the other and you actually feel like youre the fourth or fifth member of this road trip the photos over the closing credits had the audience i saw it with literally laughing all the way in to the parking lot leaving the film this is as funny and as fun as it gets,comedy
i am critical person and i think this movie isnt bad movie but do not deserve 7910 i think its like 59 last year how in the world it goes up so much 2 is coming up so this movies story is just not a surprise the director wants to keep a big secret but he cannot think out of any better idea when i knew what happened at the endi regret i spent 2 hours on this this is a story that any body can come out with definitely a superboring story the people who think its funny is just because some scene are funny so compare to other 79 movie you will see this movie doesnt look like a 79 at all since 2 is based on the same idea as 1 i think it will be as boring as the previous one,comedy
comedies must be the most critical type of film for me 1 12 hours or so of story line with a few laughs here and there does that make it a comedy action film with a few action scenes does not make it a action film get my drift but to be honest it was a good show great characters solid acting and a whole lot of trouble us blokes seem to look and want in our lives was weird to see hamburger mike tyson in this what do they say about a fool and his money any way a 7 out of 10 for me would i pay money to see it at the cinemas no but i am sure i could spend time watching something a lot worse like pontypool  ,comedy
the is about a bachelor party in las vegas for a couple of friends that ends up going totally wrong resulting in the friends trying to remember what exactly happened the night before and retrace their steps to eventually get back home again in time for the one characters wedding more problems and off the wall hilarity follows it seems recently that a film like the could really be a hit or a miss it is an r rated comedy that is very crude and sometimes very silly and something like that could go either way with critics we have all seen how well the r rated films of judd apatow have been received as well as films like borat and wedding crashers all of those films for the most part i enjoyed a lot and i will add the to the list of r rated adult comedies that actually work really well the comedic performances which i always find so important to a comedy are right on target here with a few exceptional performances from some of the supporting cast and overall they make the film work the films script is like i mentioned pretty off the wall and it really is a wild and crazy movie but it makes for a very entertaining hilarious and at times exciting ride that you just get fascinated by watching you do not perhaps want to be one of the characters in this film but watching them and as things keep getting worse and worse for them in totally unpredictable and bizarre ways it is very captivating and will sure to keep you entertained even if this genre of comedy is not your particular taste i would find it hard for someone to be bored by this film because it is so faced paced and wild that we feel the characters and us in the audience have just entered a non stop roller coaster ride that will make us laugh feel a bit nauseated at times and will certainly keep us alert and wanting more of the crazy ride we are on that i feel is an appropriate way to describe this movie and even though a lot of the film is silly and a bit on the far fetched side a lot of it is very creative and just to make an almost two hour film work so well as this one does you have to acknowledge the talent that went behind it the performances work the script works and the fast paced direction all work and make this film not just an above average comedy but instead a very good comedy that is one of the best of the past few years it is very funny entertaining and like i mentioned it will capture your interest and take you on a wild jolted ride till the film ends i personally really enjoyed myself when i saw this film and this is a perfect example of an adult comedy done right that is pure entertainment but done well so we are not only entertained but get a lot of laughter and enjoyment from watching it one of the best comedies of the year so far and for fans of the above mentioned films this is highly recommended for you as well,comedy
in the opening of the in the middle of the mohave desert bradley coopers haggard phil calls dougs fiance tracy sasha barrese to inform her that they have lost doug justin bartha distressed tracy reminds phil that they are getting married in 5 hours phil replies yeah thats not going to happen director todd phillipss the is the funniest movie of the year and the story by jon lucas and scott moore is brilliantly hystericalthe premise is outrageous in a las vegas bachelor party completely gone awry a group of buddies wake up the next morning to discover their caesars palace suite demolished with a tiger in the bathroom a baby but missing the groom doug bartha phil cooper has sore ribs and a hospital wristband dentist stu funny ed helms from the office is bloodied and missing a tooth tracys brother alan wacked out zach galifanakis is sans pants all three have no clue what happened in the previous 10 hours when they lost doug the last thing they basically remember is making a toast with alans jaeger meister phil stu and alan must pool their damaged resources and return doug for his wedding back in los angelesthe defining moment of the comes when the crew watches a surveillance video with mike tyson at his home mike asks you guys stole a police car stu sheepishly cops to this mike high fives saying nice later after watching the entire debacle on tape phil apologizes to tyson mike says we do dumb sh when were fed up that pretty much sums up todd phillipss the it is a hysterical ride and ultimately all plausible make sure to stay through the credits of the movie bradley cooper as ring leader phil is going to be a star he is tall handsome and has great comedic timing cooper also is the surprising solid one who literally rolls with the punches ed helms is the brilliantly unglued stu who is about marry his bitch girl friend melissa taut and scary rachael harris zach galifianakis is initially warped creepy as alan he points out to doug when they pick up teacher phil that he cant be within 200 feet of a school or a chuck e cheese galifianakis effectively morphs into a lovable loner justin bartha nails the straight man doug he is so comfortable being with funny which is not easywhile blitzed out his mind stu marries big hearted stripper escort jade stunning and hysterical heather graham graham is amazing and beautifully lends the its deceptive charm with all the high jinx including being attacked by a naked chinese mobster mr chow funny ken jeong wielding a crow bar or being stungunned by kids in the police station demonstration the is all fun and never mean spirited writers lucas and moore craft a hilarious tale that is strangely plausible and really about heartfelt friendship granted there are more hysterical moments that should not be missed what i really appreciated about the is its spirit and sense of fun the is one the funniest movies around,comedy
it was a girls night out and we were having so much fun we decided to go see a movie i was dying to see the latest childrens family film but my girlfriends insisted on seeing this film that for some reason got such great reviews i was very uncomfortable about the idea of somebody getting intoxicated but too the point of not remembering is just awful well i made 10 minutes into it and those were the worst 10 minutes of my life within the time frame i heard more swear words than ive ever heard before saw more nudity than i see with my husband and had the worst feeling watching these sinful people i leaned over to my friend abby and told her she could find me elsewhere in the theater for land of the lost because no way in jesus holy name was i watching this movie for another minute i enjoyed that land of the lost a whole lot more and when they my so called friends came out laughing at me saying it was the funniest movie ever i told them they better repent come sunday and i havent spoken to them since then worst movie ever,comedy
no idea how everyone thinks this movie is so funny lame humor predictable but then again i dont find bob saggett or robin williams funny either maybe its just me it was like one of those people who try to be funny all the time the jokes are forced and just dont work i can honestly say that i didnt find any part of this movie truly funny it is amazing how the media can make the public do what it wants just goes to show how most people are just puppets of the media they hype it up and give it high reviews and tell you how hilarious and super funny it is then people review it and say its hilarious and super funny unbelievable i just wish more people could think on their own and form their own ideas and thoughts besides being told what to do and think,comedy
the most overrated film since pulp fiction a bunch of morons running around dropping fbombs is not funny to me total waste of film and resources i found myself saying to myselfthis has to get better soon the script could have been written by any foul mouthed 10 year old there was very little plot originality whatsoever in this movie if it were not for the 17 to 30 year old crowd this film would not have made it past its third weekendmovies like this one are an example of the downfall andor decline of hollywood it seems like they throw these types of movies together and hype them to death and the young crowd always falls for it i am sorry i wasted my valuable time on this garbage,comedy
i expect a moronic film like this to poke fun at easy targets but i cringed when they tossed off a few casual references to the holocaust aside from being unfunny reducing the suffering of countless millions of people to a punch line amounts to cruelty its just unacceptable and has no place here if these clueless idiots knew anything at all about history and how fortunate they are to live in a society that allows them the freedom to act so immature they might behave differently but thats beside the point of this film which is to entertain on the lowest level possible i found it a rather sad experience on all counts,comedy
i watched  the today after hearing recomendations from friends twenty minutes into the film i couldnt understand why i wasnt laughing i am no prude and have found comedies such as knocked up hilarious however the clichd storyline and frat house jokes took its toll on me i found the humour that they used with the baby crossed a line it is fine to use vulgar humour if the jokes are intelligent and well thought out the makers of south park posses this skill unfortunately the makers of the lacked the skills to do this instead relying on clichd frat boy humour appealing to the lowest common denominator,comedy
maybe it was overhyped maybe it just sucked but this movie is overrated i am not a movie snob but this movie was not very funny there was not one scene that made me belly laugh bradley cooper always seems to play the ahole and his eyes are annoyingly crooked zach g is so much better on bored to death hated the way they used the baby anyway good concept with weak writing if you want a mindless comedy old school is much better but as far as this year funny people had more depth and way more laughs dont believe the hype see it just to tell people how dumb it was imdb says i have to write more but i cant even think of any more to say about this piece of crap,comedy
did not find it hysterical to see the typical negative hurtful portrayals of black asian nativeamerican etc spending millions of dollars on creating these destructive images there are a lot of great movies i only take the time to respond to ones that are hurtful spending money  one hopes to have a good fun movie experience everyone should be able to take a joke but this is yet another example of insensitive ignorant group of white guys doing their thing you should have a warning label if youre not of a specific demographic and dont have a specific set of core values than dont see this movie that would have been helpful however it seems that a little more these days a few are excerising some conscience these very typical white writers and director are not one of them,comedy
ive never actually written a review on imdb before after seeing the ridiculous ratings this movie received i had to make an account i enjoyed movies like super bad and wedding crashers so i thought this couldnt be much differentplus everyones been so hyped up about it its crap almost all the jokes are lame and fall flat throughout the whole movie i maybe smiledlaughed twice it makes me think that people who rated it highly must have been so drunk or fcked up when they watched it the actors suck it all seems so forced that its embarrassing the type of scenario in this movie has been so over done im bored of it,comedy
the until its closing credits is a little like the reservoir dogs of bachelor party movies as we never saw the heist in dogs we never see the party in this film it becomes like a comedyoferrors trapped in a mysteryriddleenigma where three guys alan stu and phil galifianakas helms copper cant seem to find their buddy doug who is you know the groom in the wedding happening in one day so their quest leads them on a path of the unlikely and outrageous theres a tiger in the bathroom and a baby in the closet when they wake from their stupor when they leave to look for them stu finds out he got married to a hooker heather graham very funny bit part and she even has her grandmothers holocaust ring as you might have seen in the trailer alans line i didnt know they gave out rings at the holocaust that should give a glimpse of other classic tidbits in the movie oh yeah and theres mike tyson singing phil collins an effeminate asian gangster maybe the only meh stereotype done and an scene with rob riggle that damn his weak daily show bits is really hystericaloh sure if you think about the movie for too long then its predictable and not all the jokes work 100 but so much of it does and the director todd phillips making the third round on this kind of outrageousguybuddycomedy flick before was the good road trip and the sometimes good sometimes overrated old school is assured with his craft here what appears to be just a situation being told does become a story with separate conflicts ie the nice mercedes stus fractured relationship with his girlfriend and spectacular camaraderie between the three main stars to give away many more of the gags some of them so obvious that they work because of the attitude of galifianakis and the style of comedy ed helms has perfected from his time at the office towards scenes that could be played for simple laughs theres real wit here and a sense of whatthef going on at every turn that makes it worthwhileso grab your buddies sneak in some beers and get ready to kick back with some guys you might recognize maybe so close youll be wondering if art imitates life a little much save perhaps for fat jesus jokes haha on a road trip in vegas delicate sensibilities need not apply as all will be offended at some point even with mild jokes like mike epps character having the same name as the missing bachelorgroom black doug white doug did i mention mike tyson sings and throws punches inbetween one cant decide if this or his recent documentary takes the cake for tysons comeback via cinema,comedy
i saw this movie as part of a promotional drive i have to say that when i first heard of it i just assumed that it would be another dude wheres my car or sex drive but i have to say i was thankfully wrong and pleasantly surprised if you are expecting a movie with a superb script and a brilliant acting display then go and watch something else as this will disappoint you but if you are looking for a nononsense simple hilarious and brilliant comedy then get your money out and go see this i cant remember laughing so much for ages the mike tyson cameo was pure comedy genius  i gave this movie 910 ,comedy
the for those of you who are looking for a lowbrow summer comedy with offensive jokes relating to babies overweight men testicles drugs hookers strippers immigrants dentists las vegas and mike tyson than the is the right movie for you directed by todd phillips of old school fame he brings back classic characters from his claim to fame the infamous wedding singer returns as well as the guy looking for the gang bang to shed light on the history of this genre of comedy that some producers and audiences cant get enough of this movie is no exception it pushes the limitations of its audience with its humor both physical and verbal from the hilarious mannerisms of alan zach galifianakis to great writing and pacing of a night that nobody can remember it all starts with a wedding followed by a flashback which begins with the bachelors alan phil bradley cooper stu ed helms and the groom to be doug justin bartha driving to las vegas for one last night of fun at caesars palace each character carries excess baggage with them phil is looking to escape his mundane life as a teacher husband and father stu is dating a possessive woman that monitors his every move alan is a hazard to be around in general and doug is getting married their plan is to just have fun and forget about where they came from and this comes back to them full circle because they get drugged before the night begins and cant remember any of the events that took place or where to find doug this is the premise for the film but the flashbacks are limited to security tapes and photos that act as the refresher for the three remaining members they go on a wild goose chase to a hospital wedding chapel sketchy motel police precinct impound lot casino floor and the dessert looking for doug they encounter doctors police officers strippers a baby a tiger mike tyson and a chinese dignitary but all of this is a blur to them and they make fools of themselves in the process trying to piece the night together but it is all in vain as the trio only puts together a timeline of events and cant decipher when are where their friend disappeared they make fun of themselves each other those around them and by those around them along the way bringing to life their personalities and giving hope to solving their problems back home along the way which adds to the humor of the storyline each character has their own subliminal conquest when entering las vegas they dont solve it when they leave but living through the night of their lives sheds light on their current situation causing each of them to appreciate the things that they have or dont have even more when they go back home in their attempt for a night of fun they overcome their backgrounds and are considered equals when it comes to their memory while searching for their friend they learn things about themselves that werent quite clear prior to their trip and are able to bring all of their past problems to the surface however no real solution is devised for any of them or their problems but they return to california changed men for the better the shouldnt be viewed as a comedy or and coming of age storyas it gets played out as rather look at the film as a guidebook for what goes into a mans head not everyone has experienced a night like this nor will many have a chance at it so use the film as a vehicle to explore the unknown and take notes on what one should and should not do along the way i dont want to spoil the ending so ill cut myself off here and leave you with a plea to see the movie with an open mind and a plan the open mind will make the jokes more amusing especially since they all come out of nowhere the plan is for how you can avoid these situations with future bachelor parties or trips to las vegas if nothing else see this movie so you know what to avoid when experiencing one of these two,comedy
typical 21st century crap like reality shows gladiator sports moron presidents and dictators are we really passed through y2k or we switched to some matrix parallel realitythis film is so bad i can not believe unreal badly written badly played boringand this was hit,comedy
i only watched it because of the good rating watched it and disliked it i didnt even smile throughout the whole movie not to mention laughing  i was wondering why would someone like thiscomedy its a mockery to the whole film industry and an insult to hollywood the jokes were paltry pitiful poor should i laugh at that fat zach galifianakiss jokes or rather admire bradley cooper no some of the funny scenes a tiger in a hotel room  yeah funny as nothing else loss of memory  i cant breathe so much i laugh a little baby whose mother is nowhere to be found  im bursting into laugh poor and horrible and overrated its only one big boredom do not waste your time on this,comedy
this movie is not funny it is awful just awful it is not funny it is kind of sick thats not a good thing to be sick it is not funny it is awful this is only funny if your brain does not work write i cant turn my brain off so i can laugh at this movie it is so gross and stupid it is just a piece of pooh big stinky pooh bad acting bad story line bad movie not funny one little bite stupid pooh i dont this movie it is not funny it is pooh pooh pooh pooh pooh pooh pooh pooh pooh pooh pooh pooh pooh pooh pooh the people who wrote this movie should be fired there idiots there dont know what means to be funny they should lucked up and forced to watch troll 2,comedy
i started to watch it and the humor was ok found it funny when zacks character took it as far to be blood brothers and that there seemed to be one sensible character in the film but he went missingand that zack thought it was cesars palace and yet he was seriousthen when one of the characters pretend to jack of a baby was disgusting that is every sickos dream and yet no one found it disturbing just because its meant to be entertainment doesnt mean that morals go out the window i found it sick that a mother would allow there child to be in a film like that i found it sick that the writer even put that in the script im all for funny films but this made me chuck the film straight in the bin,comedy
heyim a guy who loves all types of humor both highbrow most woody allen films and low billy madison bachelor party as an example of a film in the lowbrow category the disappointstremendously there is no doubt however that the context of extreme hype this movie generated added to my disappointment after seeing bradley cooper in this movie and in other roles i now conclude that he is an actor of limited range delivering forgettable performances and who adds absolutely no value to any film in contrast ed helms appears to be an actor perfect for a comedic role i will definitely seek out his future performances 2 the exception the director todd philips produced two other forgettable movies in the same buddy format as road trip and old school both are derivative unfunny films look for him to churn out more junk in the same mold believe me i love to allow the juvenile in me to enjoy a crazy buddy movie i just dont get this film if you enjoy crazy movies that attempts to emulate watch clerks billy madison little nicky or even dodge ballif you to continue to have a desire to see this movie wait for its appearance on a nonpremium cable channelnuff said,comedy
well i really expected much from this movie after all the awards received but i was really very disappointedit tried too hard to be funny and this wasnt funnyin fact it was like a drama movie in which people had terrible things happened to them and one was losti began watching this movie with open mind and i was prepared to laugh at any given moment but no it didnt work for mei thought maybe it was me not getting the comedy but i was relieved after seeing all those negative reviews  at least there are still some people who could really say it suckedif you want a good laugh watch  very bad things instead,comedy
this movie is not a good movie for people who cannot stand foul language and rude sexual humourit had funny parts and zach galifianakis alan was the funniest character and bradley coopers phil expression to alans character was laughable but thats where it ends for methis movie is no where near appropriate a comedy to watch with the familyi hope one day to find a great comical movie that is not dirty inappropriate and doesnt need to use sexuality and nudity to be funny    but in todays society i suppose ill be waiting a very long time,comedy
firstly i must say this isnt a bad movie its simply below average it is funny which means it fulfills its purpose if however you watch a lot of comedy dont expect to see anything new other than zach galifianakis everything here has been done and even his character would simply be the clichd bumbling idiot if not for galifianakis genius the plot itself is very thin and poorly though out if these guys simply utilize the logic that everyone else uses when something goes missing the movie would be over very quickly instead they go on this over bloated journey full of insanely obvious red herrings and numerous secondary characters that never seem to fit in with the atmosphere of the movie but again this is comedy and because it is it allows itself room for illogical plot holes and unnecessary silliness i recommend if one is sitting at home and this comes of tv or if your at a friends house and they happen to own it then go ahead and watch it but dont expect the type of movie youll be talking about in 20 years or even 2 as i tell my wife time and time again just because something is funny doesnt make it good i think in the grand scheme of the comedic genre of american film the ranks just below average,comedy
well it might be that everything there is to say has already been said but today i feel like sharing my opinion i am one of those people who put their dvd players on repeat especially if i like what i see i saw this movie for the first time already long time ago but i do watch it over and over again today was one of those days i must say that even though ive seen it many times it is still funny i guess it is not that easy to come up with jokes that would be funny when repeated over and over this team has done it i am so impatient for the sequel i do wish those guys most of luck and success in making the second film just as good and funny i love the fact that this movie has a reality feel to it no matter how ridiculous and impossible the situations are it still seems plausible maybe it is because those guys could be anyone and everyone like who hasnt been to a wild party well maybe not as crazy as that any way it is something new and fresh in the vast sea of americanpietype movies and all those romantic comedies dont get me wrong i liked the first american pie may be the second but all those sequels and alike no not really and whats up with all those romantic comedies girl meets boy boy meets girl and so on most of them are all the same you can see them once and forget just as you exit the theater sometimes i catch myself guessing the turns of the plot and ruining the movie for my friends by telling them exactly how it is going to end i dont like to be able to do that after the first twenty minutes i like surprises it is really rare nowadays that one gets that in a movie there are so many things made that i can understand that it is hard to find an original subject and even more to surprise the viewer well i would like to conclude this short account of my impressions by citing a friend of mine who said that this movie is the best thing that has happened in cinema this year,comedy
there are a few reasons why i would never slap more than an eight out of ten on this movie first the obvious reasonsthe trailer does indeed show in the grand tradition of comedies a huge portion of the funniest moments and basically covers the entire film fortunately the rest of the movie is so well written and really well performed that the scenes are still funny and everything in between the scenes are funnier secondly the film uses a tried and true formula and while there is nothing wrong with that it does mean that the film is a little bit predictable at times and the scenes that would have been truly funny and shocking they give away in the trailer regardless of these things the is a hilarious romp and you will go along with these crazy and very different guys and love every minute of it the best part of the film is they will make you feel like you are one of the guys on the craziest night of their livesand like them you have no idea what happened the night before making it all the more funbradley cooper headlines the cast as the alpha male and is absolutely perfect as the alpha male he is strong and suave and cool hes the popular guy that everybody wants to hang out with and cooper carries the role flawlessly he is more the straight man in this comedy but he is versatile enough that it really works and he holds the story and cast together ed helms is just terrific as perfectly composed level headed dentist stu price the character unravels almost more than any other in the film and he just does a terrific job zach galifianakis is probably the funniest member of this comedy troupe he is brilliantly perfect as the quirky awkward alan he easily becomes everyones favorite and has some the funniest lines and subtly hilarious moments in the film justin bartha plays the missing groom doug bartha gets the least screen time out of the four guys but he is still a solid part of the team and is good in the role of doug the supporting cast is really terrific and quirky and lots of very funny moments come from the supporting cast including heather graham sasha barrese jeffrey tambor ken jeong absolutely hilarious rolea must see for him alone rachael harris and mike tyson also hilarious these are the cameo roles that will really stand out and worth watching out forthe is practically guaranteed to become a cult classicmaybe even reach animal house bachelor party comedy status it is also practically a guarantee that we will see another installment in the series and you know this from the moment doug squeezes his wifes hand and whispers this will never happen again that the crazy four guys are going to get in trouble all over again and millions will flock to watch the four of them have amazing chemistry the perfect combination and personalities and performances everything just fits together perfectly sometimes thats talent and sometimes its just luck in this case it might be a little of everything certainly director todd phillips is no stranger to comedy having directed some really solid slapstick raunchy comedies but with really good stories and that is the key the is the must see adult comedy of the year it will have you in stitches and i havent heard a single bad word uttered about it so it seems like a general consensus probably the comedy of the year thus far 810,comedy
after seeing the previews i thought this movie might have potential but it would probably turn out to be another one of those stupidfunny movies that come out on a monthly basiswell the movie definitely has potential this movie is easily up there in the top 5 funniest movies ive ever seen possibly even the funniest the plot is pretty original and the casting was perfect in my opinion zach galifianakis who plays alan is hilarious the whole way through and none of the other characters disappoint either the humor is crude and while not as bad as borat is still enough to turnoff some of the more conservative moviegoers however if youre up for it this is definitely a movie worth the money i highly recommend it,comedy
well where can i start and where can i end with a film such as the first of all its a great comedy and most definitely one that i have expected for years i had a good laugh i watched it twice in a cinema and heck maybe ill go at least once more i will be buying the bluray when it comes out and i will be enjoying this brilliant piece of comedy in all of its hidef glorynow why should you go watch it when some people are badmouthing it well give it a try everyone has a different opinion and a point of view so its only reasonable if some people dont like it the trailer is all the preparation you need for this joyride so if you dont think that its your style of comedy then fair enoughi personally gave it a 9 and this is because i am overjoyed to finally see a new fresh and funny movie on the big screen again just think for a moment what kind of comedies weve been fed the last couple of years meet the spartans disaster movie epic movie thanks but ill skip those i learned my lessonthe point is this movie isnt trying to be funny by overflowing with pop culture references or lame slapstick jokes its actually an originally funny film i honestly couldnt remember when was the last time a laughed in a movie theater and enjoyed that moment with my friends by my side its one heck of an experience and im glad i didnt miss it its definitely a guy movie but that doesnt mean female viewers will be disappointed bottom line it was a refreshing experience and anyone should give it try make sure you go with friends though the more the merrier and the ending is absolutely priceless this movie has a serious pair of balls and just like the guys on the way home from vegas it passes miles ahead of all the other latest comedies letting them eat its dust,comedy
i did not really plan to watch this movie because i am not the type of guy who enjoys drinking alcohol the poster was strange and the stars were unknowns first impression was not interested however the news came that this flick actually topped the summer box office stateside i heard a couple of radio djs talk about how funny and cleverly plotted it was i had some time to kill so i was able to watch itthe is about a stag party in vegas which goes totally haywire when they wake up wasted the next morning their suite was thrashed one finds that he has lost a tooth theres a tiger in the bathroom theres a baby in the closet and worst of all the groom is nowhere to be found the three groomsmen needed to retrace the obviously wild night they had to find their friend and get him to the wedding on timeit was very funny how the director went on to steer the audience into realizing what happened together with the characters as we follow them through their madcap misadventures as this is a movie realism is thrown out of the window and our iq should be checked at the door you simply know those situations are out of this world but it grabs our attention as we too want to know exactly what happened there were potentially offensive subjects like police brutality and asian racism but we know these were done tongueincheek so we go along with the fun ridei have not seen these actors before they are really the unlikeliest of gangs i do not think people like them would flock together in real life bradley cooper plays the mean alpha male ed helms plays the nerdy straightlaced dentist zach galifianakis plays the weirdo brother of the bride justin bartha plays the groom their chemistry with each other and willingness to make fun of themselves adds to the success of this film,comedy
i saw this movie very recently on a dvd and now i regret as to why and how i missed it theatrically its amazing movie and i totally fell in love with the characters god may be i liked the movie coz there has been many occasions when i have landed in the same situation where i completely lost my mind and woke up the next morning remembering nothing hahaha and really the situation becomes really embarrassing when there are people around you who saw me doing all fing funny things and were completely on their perfect mind hhahaha i recommend this movie to everybody this is really a great movie and you will laugh to every bit part of its one liners great job though the movie is essentially a male movie and i am damn sure almost 90 of the lot would find at least a tiny bit of their lifes fun in it thanks a lot warner bros,comedy
this is quite easily the funniest film i have seen this year i watched bruno a few week s before this film and in my opinion the is 10 times better borat is also better than bruno but the is much better than borat if you havent watched this film go and watch it i have watched this film twice already and i am surely going to buy this on dvd when it comes out this film also contains a great cast of characters with great actors and actresses i love this movie so much because it made me laugh in almost every sentence in the film but not just because of the jokes and the things they were saying the great acting and the way they were saying it and how they looked when the actors said it,comedy
ok i will be short and say that this is one of those movies that people will call in future classic this is one of movies that we count in must watch categoryi could say that spent those 2hours really smart when i choosed to watch moviesso i definitely rate this movie with 10 and i recommend to all citizens of world to find some time and enjoy in this movieyou wont regret trust meeven if you read this comment you will say to yourselfthat guy was rightalso about actors i think that main actors team couldnt be chosen betterthey look like they all grown up together in real lifeits really nice syncrhonizedso you cant complain on actors because they really done their jobstoryline is interesting too so please buy and watch and enjoy,comedy
this is absolutely without a doubt the funniest movie ive ever seen i can officially say that apatow better watch his back because todd philips just set the bar very high my best friend and i were literally in pain from laughing so hard in a nutshell doug is the groomtobe he and his 3 best friends decide to have one last big guys night out in sin city before doug heads to the altar in 2 days but the plans go horribly and hilariously awry the guys wake up to a completely trashed hotel room to find that doug is missing theres a crying baby in the closet a chicken wandering aimlessly around the room mike tysons tiger is hanging out in the bathroom and none of them can remember a thing from the night before they must retrace their steps and figure out where they went and what they did the previous night in order to find their friend in time for his wedding the next day i wont give away too much more but seriously this film is an absolute mustsee the cast is amazing the cameo by mike tyson is sidesplittingly funny youll never listen to in the air tonight by phil collins the same way again i promise and i guarantee that the first words out of your mouth when you leave the theater will be we gotta see this again i know mine were i give this movie 1010 because ive never laughed so consistently and so hard in a theater before do yourself a favor and go see this movie asap you wont regret it not at the table carlos,comedy
its always great when you can share a movie experience with an entire theater of strangers when an entire crowd can burst out in a unison of laughter all the while making you appreciate each gag for its originality and authenticity the is one of those rare movies where the audience becomes an extension of the group of buddies with which you went to see the movie not to mention its fking hilarious the unity with strangers aside this movie is wholly satisfying as a comedy biased though i am a zach galifianakis fan for years now i enjoyed this film for everything it is a gutbuster brimming with laughs not only farcical in its whimsy but deeprooted in the stellar casts interplay galifianakis is brilliant as the somewhatdisturbed third wheel thrust upon the bachelor party almost all of his lines memorable and quotable cooper is spoton as the dislikable manboy ultimately redeemed through his belief in friendship and a renewed relationship with his wife helms somewhat continues his role from the office an overly preppy suburbanite with a wild side not to mention wholly committed to the wrong woman and uniquely hilarious nonetheless so heres the kicker im a film graduate raised on uppity purebred master cinema praising the work of the lowest form of entertainment comedy this movie was thoroughly entertaining engrossing and above all absolutely hysterical shouldnt my reason for purchasing a ticket to be entertained isnt that what this movie did did it not unify a roomful of complete strangers with its unabashed hilarity what then is so wrong about this relationship,comedy
this is the single funniest movie for people with my kind of humor ever made my kind of humor is movies like old school anchorman knocked up and superbad and as much as i love all of those movies in pure hilarity this one blows them out of the water even if you didnt care for those movies very much i would still expect everyone who sees it to laugh until it hurts i want to watch it a second time so i can hear all the jokes i was too busy laughing through the first time to catch unless you are easily offended or have a heart condition where a huge amount of laughter can be a bad thins this is a must see best comedy ever made bar none,comedy
sometimes the gags are not so subtle and could be predictablebut the crazysilly situations succeed in such a quick rhythm that the movie becomes sooooo delirious  i have laughed so much that i was on the edge of a heart attackeven if im a strong and healthy 29 years old mannow any man whos about to be married will demand to have as much fun as these four men and this movie reminds to every married man the great moments of fun between men he had before the greatest day of his life or the worst if the wedding turns bad personally before my wedding i was disguised into a giant condom obliged to drink a horrible pumpkinmilk milk shake i hate pumpkin so you imagine the result and ive asked to a psychiatric hospital a moist and warm shelterbut i found no tiger in my room no more to sayroll over,comedy
because of the hype i decided to give this one a try im a fan of wedding crashers role models the 40yearold virgin and i expected this film to be of the same general caliber it was in many wayshowever this film is definitely a dudeflick paralleling the chickflick as it explores the maleescape fantasy through a device i will not reveal due to imdbs scary spoiler laws i feel like it crossed the line several times in regards to a womans sense of humor and her tolerance toward humor using violent sexual offenses pedophilerelated jokes and sexualized breastfeedinghard to make the ladies bust out laughing with this list of serious icks and nonosthe other annoying part of this film was its audience sadly half the theater was filled with gentlemen that had seen it before and were either yelling things like oh god i love this part before the scene happened giggling during silences in the movie or naming the item repeatedly that is making him laugh so hard in the first placei think movies like this should be made and im so glad men are laughing and enjoying themselvesbut ladiesyou may decide to just let the guys go ahead and enjoy this one their own having seen the proposal last weekend i would definitely save my money and go see that with your girls instead hilarious worth the ticket price and a genuinely good time,comedy
heres the thing about this film yes it is vulgar and offensive we know that and its no surprise however it is also a comedic masterpiece and a very well made movie from the acting to the score the music fit the scenes beautifully and the songs dont have to be obscure and artful creations to do that each character is vivid and unique especially carlos how about that acting job with the exception of maybe mr chow who i still liked zach galifianakis somehow continues to do a tremendous job bouncing between television the big screen and stand up the comedy flows freely and is very rarely forced plus it poked some fun at other movies like 21 when alan went on his card counting rampage without being ridiculously over the top like the epic movies of the world what impressed me about this film compared to other halfhearted comedies is how the humor comes about for instance a mediocre comedy may have stu losing his tooth in some freak drunken accident that has you chuckling and saying that was okay but in the stus friend bet him he wasnt a good enough dentist to pull out his own tooth which he may have done to prove he was a real doctor which was an issue throughout maybe thats looking to deep into it though he was well you know it was small punch lines like that that helped move the story along as for the story itself its been done four friends sort of go to vegas for a bachelors party and craziness ensues although the path the film took was so innovative that you wont care,comedy
abouttobewed justin bartha is accompanied by his three friends bradley cooper ed helms and zach galifianakis to las vegas for one last breath of bachelor freedom all hell breaks loose though after the first night as bartha is nowhere to be found and the trio of pals have absolutely no recollection of anything that transpired wouldbe comedic dynamo which starts off like a champion and then fades into obscurity like a washedup benchwarmer the typical old school and wedding crashersstyled comedy wears out its welcome as the zany situations a missing tooth an abandoned baby a loose tiger a stolen police car the yakuza and so on come at you fast and furiously with adult situations and sometimes downright vulgar outcomes being the orders for the day lost in the mix is bartha just basically getting lost in the shuffle early on and usually dependable performers like heather graham and jeffrey tambor who have little more than token parts cameos by mike tyson and mike epps are unnecessary distractions and the inclusion of sexuallyconfused asian crime boss ken jeong seeing more of him than we want are dizzying sidelines which represent little rime reason and most importantly merit good for a few laughs but at an overpriced expense 25 out of 5 stars,comedy
but 77 is crazy as is anyone voting 10  how can you possibly vote this 1010 its very goodbut its overrated dont bother with the sequels,comedy
i understand how the became a hit with audiences the raunchy foul mouthed spirit of the movie is precisely the kind of thing teenage boys try to create in the schoolyard bradley cooper ed helms and zach galifianakis are the type of group every middle schooler wants to be a part of theyre vulgar cool and a little dopey the jokes if you can call them that are dumb teenage humor incarnate i get why the has its younger fans what baffles me about the is that it is so celebrated by critics this is a comedy of the worst kind one that is less interested in wit than it is in four letter words the concept of the is a good one ripe with potential for lots of laughs in it three friends retrace their steps after a wild bachelor party in las vegas in order to find the missing bachelor theres a clever idea to have the crew rediscover the pieces of their crazy night along with the audience unfortunately the concept basically fizzles out after the first couple encountersand lets talk about those encounters the little vignettes that the crew goes through to piece their night back together are total whiffs there is plenty of room for comedy here what did the crew get up to last night your mind runs wild with possibilities what does the movie give us mike tyson a tiger and a baby if you didnt laugh at that list chances are you wont laugh at the movie because all writers jon lucas and scott moore do is present these scenarios flat were asked to laugh simply at the fact that mike tyson is on the screen they met mike tyson last night isnt that funny there is absolutely no attempt to be clever with the concept its all surface another famous gag sees ken jeong jumping out of a car naked again if you dont laugh at the idea of a naked asian man then you wont laugh at the movie without adding any kind of situational thought a naked man running around screaming has less comedic value than a birthday clown scenes like this just sit there flailing around aimlessly in hopes for any kind of laughand thats the target the aims forany kind of laugh thats why the movie is so vulgar the director todd phillips is clearly just trying anything its trial and error right before your eyes this joke didnt hit throw in a couple fbombs and see if that gets anything the movie is just so peppered with filth that it all becomes meaningless when every other word is a swear it just becomes noise the trio of actors do nothing to help matters bradley cooper is a fine actor and a relatively likable persona here he is a disgusting meanspirited prick ed helms and zach galifianakis are funny funny guys they are squandered here lets face it its hard to be funny when you have nothing clever to say the dialogue here is comedically bankrupt when so long gay boys is one of your big quotes and a guy getting tazed is one of your big scenes youve got some serious script problems there are hundreds of comedies that fail because theyre too silly or they try too hard to get laughs then every once in a while comes a movie like the a film of such laziness such ambivalence to the idea of creating comedic scenarios that it physically repelled me all the does is insist you laugh at its concept and if you like filth laugh at that too its a total mess i have no idea what people see in this movie its ugly nasty gross and i did not laugh once other than that well it still sucks06100,comedy
if it werent for their incredible series premium channels would have gone the way of the dinosaurs their movie offerings are so hit and miss and they keep reshowing the same things i had heard enough about this film and i had some bills to pay so i sat down and survived it im too old i guess i know this is so outrageous that one shouldnt take it seriously i often comment on peoples reactions to things that arent anything but entertaining this film is just not very engaging its a bit too much to think that a group of men could all get so drunk that they cant remember anything for one to have that issue is stretching it for all of them well i do admit that given some of the visual stuff i did laugh i mean theres a tiger in one of the rooms theres a chicken running around but at some point it is so over the top and the issues so irreconcilable i had to think that only ridiculous plotting could get them out of this and of course it did sometimes im amazed at how movies gravitate toward the lowest common denominator and this one does as well but i will pass on being too harsh there are people who think macdonalds makes the best food there is and there are people who have this taste in movies to each his own,comedy
ridiculous storyline hokey pranks a film littered with racist sexist and homophobic slurs lowbrow humour all american boyswillbeboys white trash a movie of excess celebrating bad behaviour an american remake of the three musketeers seeing some sorry elderly mans bare behind in the doctors office is supposed to be hilarious like ewwww gross eh i really dont know why i stayed until the end it was just one farfetched over the top ridiculous prank piled over another it gave me indigestion spoiler alert and what about that vintage mercedes we never saw dads appreciation of the shape the car came back in did we and really the dentist was going to return to vegas to buy that stripper a nice dinner and take her out on a friendly date  right it was just a movie lighten up eh,comedy
i thought of watching this movie right from its release but i got the opportunity yesterday only before watching there are more stories in indian film industry are released with inspiration from the moviethis movie is fun to watch all the things which happen to be strange at the beginning have a good connection when we watch it through the movie excluding hen  though the movie is funny it is a movie where every thing can happen in real life this element makes the movie interesting all the actors in the movie are excellent although the movie has lot of surprises the most surprise element is mike tysonoverall a good movie to watch with your friends,comedy
call me in the minority but this is a guys moviethe story revolves around these three guys their trip to las vegas and all the trouble they get into this includes a mike tyson appearance a lion and some inappropriate urinationokay there were some funny moments but i couldnt help but think that this probably had a bunch of boys writing itthey might have gotten some womens feedbackthere were some funny parts for suremy friends feel differently they find the whole thing hilarious maybe theyre right,comedy
october 2 2013reviewtime plays a huge role when it comes to the making of a film foreshadowing is a technique that is often used at the beginning of movies to get the audience attention this technique can have both a negative and positive view on a movie in the movie the directed by todd phillips starts with phil on the phone with dougs wife tracy he told her that they messed up the night and lost her soon to be husband doug then the movie goes back two days earlier to reveal to the audience what happened the nights before another example of how phillips played with time is by showing the elapse of time over the las vegas skyline during the night of dougs bachelors party with his three friends in las vegas i believe philips use of foreshadowing and the elapse of time is very effective because it kept the audience anticipated to see what happenedthe use of foreshadowing at the beginning of the movie kept me engaged to see what happened to doug and the bachelor party night james berardinelli from reelviews quotes the begins and ends conventionallynp foreshadow at the beginning was conventional because it was unexpected and grabbed the audience attention immediately berardinelli went on and states the film begins with a teaser its the day of the wedding the groom is missing and his friends are in the middle of nowherenp even though the situation phil presents to dougs wife tracy was a serious situation it was also considered to be comedic because who gets lost right before their own wedding from phillips starting the movie with a flashback it created the mood and plot for the rest of the film this was a genius idea because it tells you the problem but it does not go into detail on what happened for this problem to occur this technique is opposite of an ordinary movie because usually the problem is built up into the movie rarely is it given at the beginning of it the counter argument for using this technique of displaying the problem at the beginning is because it reveals the main gist to early i do not agree with this dispute because i think this was very much needed in the because it creates an attention getteranother brilliant idea that phillips used in the is the elapse of time over the las vegas skyline even though the audience would have probably like to have seen what happened the night of dougs bachelor party they didnt get to see the outcome this is the counter argument of phillips use of time elapse honestly i thought his use of time elapse was a great idea the reason why i agree is because i think that philip had in his mind from the start of the movie process that he wasnt going to reveal the bachelor party and what happened that night until the end of the movie from philips doing this he created a mysterious effect to the movie making the audience question what happened the night of the bachelor party robert ebert the movie critic states the next morning doug will be missing the other three are missing for several hours none of them can remember a thing since they were on the roof of caesars palace drinking shots of jagermeister they would desperately like to know how in the hell do you wake up in a 4200 anight suite with a tiger a chicken a crying baby a missing tooth and a belly button pierced for a diamond dangle and when you give your parking check to the doorman why does he bring around a police car and where is doug np philips gives the audience the answers to the questions by showing how the three friends gathered up clues to determine what happened that night to find doug ebert states the search for doug has the friends piecing together clues from the er doctor mike tysons security tapes and a mattress that is impaled on the uplifted arm of one of the caesars palace statues the plot hurtles through themnp the structure of this movie through the elapse of time gives it a unique element philips was able to create more of mysterious theme in a comedic movie through the elements of foreshadowing and time elapse the is probably one of the most successful comedy movies in this century through philips play on time it adds a more realistic effect to the humorous movie the play on time fits perfectly with the randomness of the movie work cited berardinelli james the reelviews np 05 jun 2009 web 4 oct 2013 ebert robert the wwwrobertebertcom np 3 jun 2009 web 4 oct 2013 phillips todd director the dir jon lucas and writ scott moore warner bros  2009 web 4 oct 2013,comedy
phil who is the genius with two other jerks named stu the crazy doc  the stupid but genius nerd alan omg i cant stop laughing when they open the cars dicky  mr cow hits all when he comes out fantastic screenplay story  audio effects actually i realize that this could happen with anyone who drunk a lot but stealing a police car  getting marry with an prostituteo o o people are doing craziest things only when they are drunk too much and unfortunately thats true  thats what they wanna do in their real life doug who was the first character of movie isnt doing a big part unfortunately but if he does may be the movie may be a mess any way i would like to thank the crew of the movie to making me laugh overall movie is a magnificent effort that made me laugh than any other movie,comedy
thats right this is the second best movie ever made first of all ive seen this movie milions of times that i think that i cant even count them with the fingers on my hand at least i cant count with just one hand thats for sure this movie is just awesome and when i saw it i just thought this was such an incredible idea for a movie and only now they thought about it and decided to make a movie masterpieces cant be done in one minute right this movie was hilarious entertaining and it had a great castbradley cooper is awesome in this movie he cood have role where he cood be mature but also hilarious and crazy cooper is known from wedding crashers limitless the part 2 yes man and all about steve ed helms had a role familiar to bradleys role but he was probably a bit funnier ed helms rocked in this movie he was hilarious ed helms is known from the office the part 2 evan almighty semipro and cedar rapids zach galifianakis what can i say this movie woodnt be so awesome as it is if it didnt had zach in it zach just steals the show hes hilarious in every time hes on the screen just to hilarious to be truth zach is known from gforce what happens in vegas the part 2 due date and its kind of a funny story the rest of the cast is completed by a cameo with matt walsh and rob riggle and its also completed with the amazing role by jeffery tambor justin bartha is also in it and ken jeong too sow the three first actors ive wrted in there are now three of my favorite actors specially zach then ed and then bradley choosing a not to known cast for an incredible movie was a big risck but it was worth it these three guys cood show their big potential since this movie i guess all of them are very knowndoug justin bartha is about to get married but before that he and his buddies planed a bachelor party in vegas doug phil bradley cooper stu ed helms and his fiancs brother alan zach galifianakis are the three guys who are joining doug to vegas after getting there and go to the hotel room thinking they will have a night that they will never forget when they wake up it happens exactly the opposite they all wake up with a giant they dont remember everything of what happened last night stu losts a tooth by the way stu was a dentist doug is missing theres a baby in the closet a tiger in the bathroom who appears that belongs to mike tyson himself stu got married to a hor jade heather graham and now phil stu and alan who call themselves as the wolfpack will have to do everything it takes to remember what happened last night so they can find doug and go back to the wedding its not going to be that easy see that this is the second best idea for a movie the first best is the idea for horrible bossesoverall as you can see this movie is hilarious you will constantly laughing the story will lead you entertained every second this movie has a great cast and it also has lots of memorable quotes second best movie ever made extremely recommended grade a,comedy
the is a very good comedy movie i spent almost all the movie time laughing this one will make you laugh till you fall on your back i can rate it one of the best comedy movies in history  a group of friends meets many situations in which they act think and talk some comedy i didnt laugh this much a long time ago i loved every second of the movie and im ready to watch it again and again and again and im sure i will not be bored all the four characters are amazing in this film they played their roles very professionally so if you want a good comedy movie this is the one you are looking for as i can see in the moment i wrote this review it has a rating of 79 and im sure it deserves more than that i rated it 10 stars as i love comedy movies especially good ones like this,comedy
what can i say best comedy since the jim carryadam sandlerchris farley days of the mid 1990s sure a little far fetched in some scenes but still never a dull moment just the little things alan saysand the expressions on their faces during the crews small talk is priceless in itselftaking place in las vegas just adds to the comedy value of the film the unrated movie version is just perfect and the original release is missing some key momentsthey couldnt have picked a better cast and crew to do this comedy 4 friends all different in many ways but still find a way to laugh in the worst of times,comedy
ill be straight up honest i didnt like the i thought it was overhyped and really not much to write home about back then it got a c and i recall considering walking out it was so offensive and pointless all that didnt stop it from raking in almost a halfbillion worldwidethis style of movie is a convergence of the tina fey generation of comedy writers and the rrated comedy run that started probably with wedding crashers and has not let up they are the comedies with no jokes just funnygrossoffensivewacky  you name it  as long as you dont have to actually put in the effort of writing a single funny line of dialoghere we go on part 2 in a particularly good choice i went to the crackhead cinema ive yet to see a good movie at this theater and i didnt think anything was going to change turns out crackheads are within the target audience the place was packed and roared with laughter throughout the entire movie i was a little island of silence in the middle of a jovial high crowd i managed one heh at some galifianakis line but it was part 1 all over again and i mean that literally  it was the same story in every way just set in a different city they wake up after a wild bender someones missing all is well by the endthe difference that gave the a c was a bit of heart some personal growth and a little bit of dramatic tension phil has to own up to what happened stu broke up with his controlling girlfriend to pursue his wifestripper with a heart of gold i know youre saying but this is a comedy fat man theres no plot needed sure if its complete nonsequitur comedy but any narrative comedy or not need to have some plot structure and a reason to exist all that development is all thrown out the window in part 2 where they are all great friends already stu has dumped his mistake of the past and they apparently have not learned a single thing about honesty bottom line i dont care how cool a woman is none of this is instantly okay with some time maybe right away absolutely not the characters reverted to their selfish lying selves that we saw at the beginning of part 1 also extreme irresponsibility last i checked does not increase the respect of someone who has no respect for you to begin with you know just in case you were planning something wild to impress your boss and get that big raisethe part ii is just another rrated comedy that begs the question can you call it a comedy if there are no jokes,comedy
whatta movie wow is the best comedy movie ever made dont read anything else just go and watch the moviehow the hell did they manage to find this guy alan and why havent we seen him any other movie till now alan is superb the spine of the movie if i can say stu is hilarious and phil is the kinda guy we all want to be  cooler than icegreat script superb performances the merc looks stunning and so does tracy in the bridal dress and the soundtracks are too good ive been running around to get all the songs from this movie for so long nowwell even if you have a crazy bunch of friends like these guys you have to watch this masterpiece 10 on 10,comedy
this movie is one of the best comedy movie ever made in hollywood the story is about four friends one of them is the groom who go to las vegas for bachelor party and in night they get so drunken that the next morning they couldnt remember what they did last night and then the story unfolds and they come to know what crazy things they have doneit is one of those movies in which almost after every 10 min something new comes up and you say to yourself  oh god now where did this come from i mean the whole story is very nicely displayed and each character leaves its markby the name of the movie you might get the idea that it will be about some people getting drunk and then not knowing what they are doinghave done after that but this movie is far better then this simple idea the things shown in the movie is simply awesome and the way it story reveals itself is superbbradley cooper and zach galifianakis did very good joball in all an excellent comedy movie,comedy
todd phillips created a tightly constructed witty comedy thats extremely rewatchable compared to other movies like borat or superbad this movie has great musical atmosphere which adds a great touch to the comedy which can be enjoyed by people from 8 and up if we are being honest here 8 year olds are not stupid this movie was very popular in my grade school and still is very entertaining and charming,comedy
a very funny thematic movie about a realist what it can be like to get wild and drunk that can lead you to a very brain damaged which could cause amnesia to has been over a decade since this movie came out and this is still very funny,comedy
top 10 comedies of all time enough jokes and hilarious situations to keep laughing long after the viewingsit back and enjoy the ride,comedy
classic there isnt much else to say about this buddy comedy in the heart of sin citythis is one of my alltime favorite comedies it has its moments of pure ridiculousness but when it shines it absolutely is brilliant bradley cooper ed helms and zach galifianakis really know how to round out a comedy and push the limits on what you thought was going to be just another run of the mill buddy movie,comedy
laughed through the whole moviethe movie is so much funyoull love the characters especially allanliked the story and the endingtodd did such a great job,comedy
the best comedy in a decade  keeps getting funnier with each watch,comedy
extremely funny highly recommend for comedy lovers its an 1hour 30 mins of comedy rollercoaster,comedy
i found this film very funny and in 2009 it was very different to any film i had seen in a while i found myself laughing out loud at some of the jokes so im glad i watched it at a mates house ha i still remember some of the famous quotes from the original film so long g boys hey she is a nice lady you gonna fon me however when something is good they tend to ruin it by making too much of a good thing to make money i found the second one funny but it didnt suprise me as much as the first one because they used the same scenario having a such a hang over that you dont remember anything and haveing a person missing that you have to find the thrird one was funny but you could kind of tell that it was purely a film that had be created to make money rather than an originall film for veiwers enjoyment,comedy
i held off on watching the forever because i thought it would be stupid and unwatchable well it certainly is dumb but it actually had a plot that i became invested in while i watched it get ready for some f words and sex jokes but as long as you can handle that youll find this movie entertaining,comedy
i watched this film for the first time 2 weeks ago have since at least watched this film end to end 5 times have watched certain scenes a good 20 times and learnt stus song on the keyboard so needless to say i enjoyed this film very much and some might even call it a slight obsession what i love the most are the ridiculous and exaggerated situations that the gang has to overcome the cast did a fantastic job portraying their roller coaster of emotions as they try to trace their steps and figure out what happened during their wild night the characters in the movie are well developed with each having his or her own distinct personality these personalities are clearly surfaced through the way each character responds both verbally and physically under different situations the characters strengths and weaknesses complement one another well and the cast had great chemistry overall this movie is a mustwatch,comedy
i thought that this film is one of the best comedys today i really loved this movie it was funny exciting awesome and had great actors great plot i was laughing my head off when i first saw this masterpiece and i still do,comedy
this film was a comedy set apart from the rest of the genre what sets this comedy apart from others is a well structured script and a pace that doesnt allow any form of thinking the chemistry between the four leads is also a plus the jokes and actions will leave the audience rolling in laughter sometimes making you feel bad for laughingthe cinematography doesnt stand out but it doesnt need to in this comedy the actors did an amazing job with their roles the chemistry between them makes the friendship feel genuine the music choices fit the theme of las vegas escapades well the plot was interesting and made the movie feel like a comedic mystery movie it kept the audience guessing as to what would happen next and the comedy helped propel the story to its end the is a great comedy that hits almost all its jokes and doesnt feel stale after watching it more than once,comedy
awesome comedy modern  hilarious i love all the actors funny from start to end,comedy
the whole film keeps you entertained with stupid laughs that make you lol,comedy
the 2009 is a professionally produced comedy about three friends phil played by bradley cooper stu played by ed helms and alan played by zach galifianakis that wake up with no memories of a bachelor party the night before in las vegas during their eventful enlightenment they search for their missing bachelor friend doug played by justin bartha in order to get him safely back to his scheduled wedding this film is hysterical in every right it made my laugh from beginning to end with its over the top antics and comical twists it reminded me of similar life experience though not as extreme still very funny and nostalgia inducing the writing and dialogue are both very well put together though different backgrounds effect dialogue but its the story that is actually magical even though this film is a comedy and the acting is executed superbly in its extremeness the story is about having your buddys back i sincerely enjoyed how the director todd phillips allowed the comedy to flow without abandoning the message the whole film is about trying to figure out what happened the night before but it is all in an effort to locate and save doug through the comedy the director still provides a sense of identifiability to the audience in caring for a friend overall this is a topnotch comedy that i would recommend to everyone that has friends they would bend over backwards for,comedy
ill never forget the day i was this film in theaters i couldnt even see straight because i was laughing so hard i was crying nonstop,comedy
the cast set for this movie was perfect lots of one liners when you pay attention to the different characters using them ed helms really showed his comedy genius and was great teaming up with the other characters,comedy
hilariously funny at times and more intelligent than your average hollywood slapstick does seem to run out of new ideas and steam at about the 1 hour mark though,comedy
its really wonderful to see a comedy movie that relies on its script more than its jokes and jon lucas and scott moores script is one of the most clever scripts written for a comedy movie ever what proves that is that this movie isnt fastpaced as the rest of comedy movies actually its sorta slowpaced but i liked that and i think its perfectly paced that doesnt mean that the movie isnt funny in fact there are many lines that are hilarious but honestly i didnt laugh out loud or even laugh a lot as much as i should or wantedthe jokes at the third act are kinda silly and lazy as well as the third act as a whole the chemistry between galifianakis bradley cooper and justin bartha is gold 7510,comedy
anyone that doesnt like this movie has no sense of humor and should stick to romcoms or documentaries,comedy
ken jeong isnt funny hes a former doctor and shouldve stuck to it his humors really corny like a little kids secondly if dougs locked on the roof of the hotel why wouldnt he just keep yelling to civilization below he wouldve been heard especially if a mattress is hanging from the roof it would cause attentioninquiryinvestigation not just ignored all day my grand finale why would he choose to cook in the sun for hours and hours when there are shady spots all over the place its not funny its just stupid and ridiculous,comedy
doug billings is getting ready to marry his beautiful bride tracy garner in this comedic adventure directed by todd phillips before the wedding takes place doug and three of his friends plan a one night bachelor party in las vegas everyone knows what happens in vegas stays in vegas and this movie is the definition of that statement the movie begins with phil wenneck calling dougs bride to be from a remote desert location phil looks like he has been beat to a pulp and he informs tracy that they have lost doug the conversation ends abruptly and we are taken back in time to phil and his soon to be brotherinlaw getting fitted for tuxedos doug and alan discuss their trip to las vegas and the movie proceeds with the introduction of dougs bachelor part attendees stu price who loves to be called doctor price because he is a dentist is introduced while packing his bags for vegas his wife is very condescending and controlling and stus friends have no shame in pointing this out stu convinces his wife they are going on a wine tasting tour the guys show up to pick him up and away we go to pick up phil phil is a teacher by day and a party animal by night the guys are all together and ready to head to vegas once the crew arrives in vegas they get settled in their hotel room and decide to go to the rooftop to have a toast before the night begins alan gives a wolf pack speech addressing how happy he is to have new members in his pack the guys throw back a few shots and the scene cuts to a destroyed hotel room everyone slowly waking up with a and doug nowhere to be found the hotel room has a lovely tiger in the bathroom that was acquired the previous night which by the way nobody has any recollection of alan phil and stu are on a mission to find doug because his wedding is the next day director todd phillips takes us on a hilarious ride with alan phil and stu trying to figure out what happened the night before and where they left doug the theme of this movie revolves around the theme of getting drunk the effects of drugs and what happens in vegas stays in vegas the guys go on wild ride which we are engulfed in the entire movie the editor makes good use of montages to take us through the night that happened but nobody can remember alan stu and phil discover a tiger in the bathroom a baby in the closet chickens running amuck and their man of the hour missing in action as the movie progresses there is good use of transition with music the editor does a fine job tying scenes together with musical bridges that are unobtrusive to the flow of the movie this movie also makes good use of camera angle to get the viewer in the scene a handheld camera angle is used in one scene where stu is looking around frantically for doug stu is in a state of confusion and feeling a heavy the camera angle is a great tie in to the theme because it depicts what can happen in las vegas if you let your inhibitions run wild todd phillips has made several movies with a theme dealing with partying hard and getting in to trouble todd phillips also directed the movie old school with will ferrell luke wilson and vince vaughn this is another hilarious comedy that involves drinking making poor decisions but having fun every step of the way the does an excellent job using crude dialogue to keep the viewer on their toes phil alan and stu represent what happens to a lot of bachelor party attendees when they are let loose in vegas the dialogue is relevant to the relationships the guys have with each other and to the situations played out in the movie the idea of getting incredibly drunk and unknowingly taking drugs is portrayed with a great comedic twist in the there may be several bachelor party movies where something goes wrong but this movie is one that will last through the passage of time director todd phillips was able to take a common plot and put twists and turns throughout the movie to keep the viewer guessing as to what really happened that night spoiler alert the movie ends with a hilarious montage of photos on a digital camera that alan found in the back seat of his dads car finally our guessing is over and the events that took place do not disappoint,comedy
i was really really looking forward to this film every trailer id seen made me laughso saturday night comes around its available through virgin and so cuddle on the sofa with snacks and start watching itkeep glancing at hubbsta as he hadnt laughed once and i had to admit my laughter was a bit forced at timesit was a real shame as i think it could have had more potential its for the people who liked anchorman 40 year old virgin that kind of filmif anything it had a sweetish ending,comedy
not funny at all just not funny not a bit i remember i smiled a few times but no recollection of a laugh i saw the 10 minute longer unrated version i was hoping for some laughs and fun but instead i got so bored damn i have this habit to see to the end it was unnecessary to shoot for the cinema is waste of time for the audience i dont understand what some people find funny about this movie but if you are not a person that laughs at everything if you are selective about comedy you will not want to see this movie again even laughersatfart and laughersatcurse wont like it and a part 2 is coming god forbid,comedy
this seems get a lot of praise from professional critics and casual viewers alike however this isnt going to get much from me the whole thing just seems like a rehash of ideas whichve been already done before moreover theres no fresh feeling to it either as its done in a typical modern day comedy fashion ie tons of swearing lots of sex references action scenes and obscene humour i dont have a particularly huge problem with any of these characteristics but when they are what the movie is based around it gets quite a bit annoyingthe storyline isnt as bad as some of the movies in the same vein and there were a few moments that made me smile and even semi laugh but the overall humour comes off as pretty dry using the f word a billion times does not make a movie funny but that seems to be a problem with a lot of comedies nowadaysoverall i though it was a pretty mediocre movie and i would only suggest checking it out if you like similar movies eg pineapple express observe and report superbad etc personally im sick and tired of these kinds of movies,comedy
yes a raunchy comedy revolving around guys who have had a few too many is the years best film so far its not only the gallons of laughs that mike tyson and zach galifianakis are only the start of its that this is a great mystery film the mystery revolves around doug justin bartha a man whos about to get married he goes to vegas with his friends phil bradley cooper and stu ed helms and his bridetobes brother alan zach galifianakis their perfect night in vegas turns into a for the ages theyve lost doug and can not remember a thing from the night before they must go out to find doug the night before involves a tiger a chicken a baby a stripper named jade heather graham who stu accidentally marries and mike tyson the real joy of this movie is that were as interested to figure out what the hell happened as much as they do you feel like youre part of the mystery the conclusion is nothing less than perfect when the end credits roll you see a bunch of pictures on a camera that show what really went down that night it is the perfect finale to a movie that can only be described as a funnier raunchier version of dude wheres my car,comedy
you know i thought it would be hard to top the comic lineup of films that we had in 08 tropic thunder pineapple express step brothers forgetting sarah marshall and role models last year was a good comedy year until 1201 a m june 5th 2009the has got to be the funniest film i have ever seen the characters have great development and fall wonderfully into their situation if you havent seen the preview heres a synopsis guys go to vegas for bachelor party they get messed up spend the rest of movie looking for the groom they lost the night before bradley cooper was the perfect choice for the leader of the bozos about in las vegas ed helms is perfect as the doctor with the horrible girlfriend also played very convincingly by rachel harris and the uptight but loose at the same time attitude alan is the off the wall comic relief in this equation and has some of the most memorable lines in the film the soundtrack is also great and goes well with this filmthis is truly the funniest movie in a long time that i have seengo watch as soon as possible,comedy
the makers of this film copied the style of the farrelly brothers you know the guys that brought you dumb and dumber1994kingpin1996and theres something about mary1998 and came up to being as good and entertainingit begins with four friends philbradley cooper alanzach galifianakis stued helms and dougjustin bartha decide to go to las vegas for a bachelor party there friend doug is getting married so they wild night of celebrating and swore this would be a night they would never forget well next day they realize that it really was a night that they did forget everything is messed up they feel out of it to make matters worse the groom to be doug has gone missing murphys law ensues as they try to find there friend will they find him in time before the wedding this was one funny raunchyslapstick comedy everything was timed perfectly i mean every joke and every gag and there are no scene steelers every character shines in a comedic way a perfect adult comedy it never once gets boring or stupid for a second,comedy
after the reaction that this film created i thought that it was about time i watched it  two years after its release the name of the film made me believe the humour would be entirely predictable and probably a bit too crude i was expecting to see the best comedy of the past decade because of peoples amazement when i could say i have never seen the and i can now say that i dont regret my rather late viewing of the filmi was disappointed by the films humour there were too few laugh out loud moments and i thought that because of this the film just seemed to drag on and on i would not call it boring but i would certainly call it mediocrethe acting was of a fairly decent quality bradley cooper seems to have come out of nowhere although i seem to be the only person who remembers him from wedding crashers i have never particularly liked him as an actor partially because of his arrogant presence on the screen and this for me it a problem in the film i found the other two of the main characters to be fairly sound and seeing heather graham was a breath of fresh air it was nice to see her in a majorish film her first since austin powers the spy who shagged me over ten years agowhile the above is for the most part fairly negative it was still a film that you could watch from start to finish while not feeling bored at its end my particular part was a certain cameo appearance which was probably the highlight of the film as this made the fairly crude humour to be more ridiculous and entertaining which was definitely neededall in all the is worth a watch but dont expect to see the best comedy of your life because realistically it is not better than most of the other comedies coming out at the moment,comedy
the is a movie about some guys stu doug alan phil who go to vegas for a bachelor party the bachelor party is for doug and it is just a few days before the wedding is supposed to happen while in vegas the group ends up losing doug and the whole movie is their journey to find him they try to back track from what they can remember and find himthere were a few reasons why this movie was so great for one the cast couldnt have been much better than what it was zach galifianakis is one of the funniest people in hollywood today also its a really catchy movie and is very easy to quote without even realizing it such as driving drunk classic another reason i loved this movie so much is because it was appealing to people my age college student and even people much older than mei do not have very many complaints about this movie there were a couple parts that i thought were a little slower than the rest for instance when they are in the desert at the end with the asian for those who have seen it know what im talking about and for those who havent will know after you see it another bad part was tysons acting i understand hes a boxer and not an actor but it couldve been someone else famous who knew how to act a little betteroverall i was very pleased with the movie and i am now a proud owner of the dvd it will always be a classic to me as my dvd collection grows,comedy
firstly as the is basically blotto memento and unfolds back to front i cant give ya too much in the way of ploti will tell you things i thought prior to watching the movie1 in advance of the movie starting i had set the overunder of gay jokes at 5 and i had the over i was close but wrong although the first 2 gay jokes come in the first couple minutes2 i saw heather grahams name in the credits and thought that exponentially increases the chance of seeing boobies again only sorta right not sure breastfeeding counts3 this seems to want to be quotable the jury is out i for one cant think of much that i would regurgitate in social situations4 this one from my wife bradley cooper is ben affleck hot now i know my wife so sadly i know this is supposed to be a compliment  not sure cooper would agreenow the limited things i can say without giving too much awaythe boys leave for a bucks party in the days prior to the wedding zach galihhjgajsdfjgbjksbdjhikis sp is the standard ringinrelo that is almost always in attendance everyone has met him multiple times but noone really remembers himquick question why a bucks party so close to the wedding and why could such an apparently cool guy only have two friends and a relo that would want to go as a guy i would consider that poor form any reasonable guy needs a couple days recovery time from a good bucks partythe jittery bride is told on the phone that the wedding aint going ahead as planned then the wavy lines appear in our minds and we go into flashback modethe basically starts when three of our four lead characters awake after a rough night celebrating a bachelor party in their 4200 per night villa are the ingredients that over the film provide most of the laughs and help explain just what the hell happened last nighta tiger a chicken a missing tooth a baby a hospital tag a mattress on roof a cop car in their hotel bayall of which are explained fully aside from the chicken seriously what happened to the chicken i really hope there is an explanation in the sequel explaining the chickens existence why why why was it to feed the tigerunfortunately these are the things that keep me awake at nightanyway it wasnt the hilarious quotable laff riot i half expected going in it was a pretty funny 90 minutes with some memorable scenesgetting out of a night in prison finding a random naked guy in the car boot meeting mike tysonzach galikjuhkgcvksvdckhvsjikis sp again is suitably random and apparently wastedwithoutbeingwasted at all times but not as randomly hilarious as described in other reviews by any stretchbradley affleck cooper is the most rational and realistic of the three while he is still a wker at times he is no more a wker than a myriad reallife guys that i have encountered at various bucks parties and gents eventsand as far as the dentistguy and his btch girlfriend goes no man should ever be as whipped as he is and no comeuppance could be drastic enough to teach her a lesson i am not being sexist everyone should have the right to a 5050 relationship and if they choose to have a 6040 or a 7030 and both parties agree so be it the chick in this film is a total btch and needs a floggingfinal rating  75  10 humorous but by no means hilarious will however be deemed an immediate classic by those still too young to have forged their own drunk stories god willing their time will come and this wont be as far outif you liked this or even if you didnt try oneguyramblingcom,comedy
before the was released it was the talk of the town even its previews were funny i mean although most comedy films previews are funnyor are at least supposed to be funny this was more than i expected talk about lol the was more than laugh out loud funny even mike tyson the champ surprised me with a little laughter in his tiger scenethe plot of this film held my attention by making me want to see what else happened last night this comedic trio of bradley cooper as phil wennick ed helms as stu price and zach galifianakis as alan garner tickled my funny bone with their hilarious endeavors not only is the a knee slapper and a belly cruncher it could actually be a based on a true story film it is that believableyet unbelievably funnyfrom start to finish this film is comedy at its best,comedy
you mind putting on some pants i feel weird having to ask you twiceit has become so rare in this century to find a genuinely decent and funny comedy in the crowd of scary movie type comedies todd phillips fresh and hilarious the stands out as a clear winner for modern comedythe plot is simple four friends travel to las vegas for a bachelor party and wake up the next morning with no memory of what happened the previous night this plus the fact that they dont know where the groom is makes for a rollercoaster ride of hilarity as the remaining three friends try to find him in time for his wedding the next dayin short the is just genuinely funny it may actually be the funniest movie ive had the pleasure of watching in a long time so much so that it has become one of my favourite movies galifianakis the child with a beard effectively makes this movie the brilliantly hilarious trip that it is his unashamedly idiotic behaviour provides much of the hilarity and it seems as if the movie would be pretty empty without him but all three leading men have brilliant chemistry together and its hard to imagine anyone else playing a different role in this moviethe is sure to become a cult classic and i dont see it ever getting old i also really never thought id be feeling sorry for heather grahams character at the end so far ive seen this five times and ill probably watch it a hundred times more a definite must buyhttpukmoretk,comedy
i feel like quite a sucker for having bothered to buy and then watch the it follows the aftermath of a stag night in vegas  four friends get drunk are slipped some drugs and then forget what they did losing the groom on the way it struck me that this is dude wheres my groom  the characters all uncharismatic all unfunny wander around vegas trying to piece together the night before and find the groom think of every clich concerning vegas and you will find it here the writing was not witty the jokes as such were not especially funny there was certainly no drama  i could not care about any of these people definitely a major disappointment and definitely overrated there must be better american comedies out there somewhere,comedy
first time i skipped this movie but one of my friend said to watch this and thanks to him i watched this and if i miss this i think it is a real miss in the point of view of a comedy moviemost interesting part is tiger scene in mike tysons house i would say this is the best ever comedy movie i have ever watched it is a real comedy movie with a nice story the only part they missed is they have forgotten to solve how the chicken came to hotel room and also this movie is strengthen by without much involvement of actresss acting zach galifianakis super acting i havent seen him any other movies earlier and also bradley cooper and ed helms superb acting love to watch this again and againwaiting to watch part 2,comedy
this film is far better than is deserves to me i thinki was thinking porkies rolled up with the real cancun or something when i saw the trailers in reality this smart comedy is a delight its fastpaced very irreverent and spot on for grossoutnessone minor unsettling thing about it for me anyway was the veiled subplot involving the bearded brother and his paedophilia im afraid i didnt quite get it and the subject was approached in such a way as to be very disturbing i dont quite know why but id question why anyone would need to include that in this fine romp i can only assume it is introduced to induce a lowlevel feeling of anxiety in the viewer that this brother is going to so something so heinous during the film that it will shock  if thats the aim then i suppose it does take ones mind off some of the visual gags etc that would give the excellent twist in the tail away having said that i did view the uncut rrated version and maybe this material was cut from the final cinema release im not saying it was wrong to try and unsettle the audience even more or anything just that it didnt seem to belong therei thoroughly enjoyed this despite thinking i wouldnt,comedy
recap its two days before dougs wedding and he and three friends head to las vegas for the bachelorparty but you know what they say what happens in vegas stays in vegas and now this almost literally comes true as the three friends wakes up in the morning after with no memories at all and doug completely gone the three friends now must retrace their steps from their wild night in order to find their lost groom and what about the tiger in the bathroom comments actually not what i expected i did expect a high paced almost silly comedy from the get go surprisingly it started out quite slow with a long and detailed introduction and explanation how they got to vegas that almost became boringthen it started for real and it was really funny but it didnt go off in that pace i expected but im not sure thats a bad thing instead it changes pace from moment to moment really making the audience pay attention and it really takes off in totally unexpected directions some quite hilarioussurprisingly enough there is a collecting thought behind it that even if doesnt seem so at times directs the heading of the story and neatly ties everything together in the end well everything except the rooster i guessa really good and fitting cast with actors i recognized but couldnt quite place in the leads they did very well though it felt like they did have some good chemistry between them and apparently some of them have made movies beforei liked this movie i liked it a lot it had just the right level and amount of humor just the right kind of absurd humor that suit me just right now it they just had skipped or at least shortened the introduction everything would have been just great now they have something to work on for the sequel a strong 710,comedy
ive paid to see the 13 times my personal record for one title so until a funnier flick comes along its my gold standard for what a modern comedy should be a lot of folks would call this funny but not the funniest i can understand that perspective and a lot of people who werent laughing at all were attending weekend screenings i was at i can only tell those who didnt bust a gut at this vegas is hell story they should have stayed home and watched reruns of murder she wrote or whatever crap they find entertaining to keep seeing a film multiple times is to sometimes get a dream crowd and other days get a group of codgers who are simply at the wrong movie for them those tuesday nights when the theatre was packed were amazing and the collective riotous laughter was louder than any other film ive been to besides theres something about mary and this is spinal tap i can only hope we get another collaboration from phillips helms cooper galifianakis bartha and the rest of this band of lunatics best film of 2009,comedy
dont be fooled by others as it is so clearly stated in phil collins song in the air tonight and i can feel it coming in the air tonight oh lordwell if you told me you were drowning i would not lend a hand ive seen your face before my friend but i dont know if you know who i am well i was there and i saw what you did i saw it with my own two eyes so you can wipe off the grin i know where youve been its all been a pack of liesand i can feel it coming in the air tonight oh lordwell i remember i remember dont worry how could i ever forget its the first time the last time we ever met but i know the reason why you keep your silence up no you dont fool me the hurt doesnt show but the pain still grows its no stranger to you or meand i can feel it coming in the air tonight oh lord,comedy
usually we expect a lot less in the movies than what we see in the trailers as they are supposed to be good to attract people to the movie but occasionally you get some of the movies which outperforms not only the trailers but also your expectations from a movie and is definitely is one of these occasional moviesyou will never regret even a single second of the movie after the initial plot and the introduction of the characters the ride begins and never slows down till the end of the movie every character in the movie the timing of the events and the flow of the story is excellent the best part is nobody in the movie is trying to be funny but still you will have a smile on your face throughout the movie,comedy
thanks to the imdb rating i spent 15 hours of my life watching this great comedy i recommend it to anyone eager to have quality fun it really is a masterpiece of the american movie factory i find that any other successful comedy movies are paling in comparison to this state of the art movie it truly reveals some very talented actors and one very clever director their skills in transmitting emotions to the public are unique really a very nice example of the power of the american movie school lets not forget about the script which is delicious it made me roll on the floor laughing i didnt have such a good laughing in ages,comedy
funniest movie ive ever seen the quote above is just one of many from this movie there are enough one liners to quote for the rest of the year well at least according to everyone at my school ha ha ha mike tyson even made me laugh and not at him this time ed helms is at his best for sure here i have nothing against my best friends wedding but how can you compare those two moviesthe end was the best part though my girlfriends face was so red for days from laughing so hard and the bachelor party in the movie was so much better than the ones ive been to in real life that is pretty sad though so take it for what you will most importantly if you do not see this movie you will have no idea what everyone is talking about,comedy
the is summers best film i wont go into details about the funny parts because if you are one of the few people who still havent seen it words just wont do this film justice i will however give kudos to those involved in making this movieprimarily the film works as a result of a brilliant narrative device we are just as clueless as the characters are about what happened the night before as the film progresses we are given one shocking revelation after another each building to high comedy the momentum is almost nonstop a lot of the humor is also generated from the corky characters and how they react to each shocking development bradley cooper ed helms and zach galifianakis all turn in brilliant performances and stay in character rather than just acting goofy the fact that they all seem so believable makes the chaos that they face all the more hystericallaughter is valuable to your health and it is hard to produce an effective comedy these days anyone who needs to laugh is well served by seeing this movie even if you dont need a laugh see this movie,comedy
usually when people talk about s they usually meant about the day after drinking a lot in this case the is the most ingenious comedy ive seen in the year directed by todd phillips the contains all kind of comedy and humor existed in this world it is an hour and a half full of laughs it is cleverly written two days before his wedding doug and his three friends drive to las vegas for a blowout bachelor party theyll never forget the movie follows a fast paced rhythm a very nice thin for the viewer because you never get tired or bored it also has some great locations in las vegas in fact you can see two different faces of vegas one at night so glamorous and shiny and the other in the desert with amazing landscapes another thing you appreciate from the movie is its wonderful soundtrack the music is so good and every song in it fits to the perfection with every scene in the film the cast is excellent every actor and actress delivers an excellent and convincing performance specially zach galifianakis as alan he was so funny and the special appearance from mike tyson was great the only purpose is to entertain people and im sure people will enjoy every minute of it in conclusion it is the best comedy of the year,comedy
this movie is just one of many in its subgenre of comedy this one just having been far overhyped the is not the sort of movie that appeals to its audience with realism instead deciding to use either very stereotypical characters or unrealistic characters an example of this would be the schoolteacher he is a teacher who hates the kids he teaches and spends a weekend out drinking with his buddies in vegas it would have been more prudent to have him as someone who was unemployed or just in a profession not working with kids to create a more realistic characterthe movie does however create some laughs in the middle section of the film where the characters were essentially on a wildgoose chase these come from shock comedy such as the naked guy in the boot of the car coming out and beating up all of them mike tysons cameo was also quite funnythe movie also had issues with its pacing with the beginning and end seeming to drag particularly at the end at the wedding was far too long and i was very boredall in all the movie works if you take it for what it is a fairly average comedy with some great moments but poor characters and a very very stereotypical plot,comedy
honestly the funniest movie since forgetting sarah marshall right up with it and 40 year old virginhas a completely different comedic style to the majority of the apatow inspired comedies of the last few years not that theres anything wrong with judds films but at the same time totally different and much better than old schoolgalifianakis is brilliant and the cameos fit in perfectly even the way in which the protagonists piece together the events of the previous night is well woven and not disjointed in any way its been superbly put togetherjust a great great comedy,comedy
this is really very funny provided that you like shock humor crude humor situational humor ridiculous circumstances etc i didnt even think the preview i saw looked that funny so i was surprised when the story got underway and i couldnt stop laughing the main characters personalities vary so much that much of the comedy too comes from the quirky character traits they have  and how that causes each of them to react differently the absurd situations they have gotten themselves into this rrated comedy is a nice departure from the films of judd apatow or the comedies of will ferrell or adam sandler im not saying i dont like those other guys but sometimes it seems like those are the main comedy options along with romantic comedies or family comedies well heres a new original hilarious comedy loved it,comedy
where to begin guess i could start with the evolution of raunchy r  rated yet smart highconcept comedies where three  dimensional key characters must deal with over  blown situations and charicatured characters in modern  day america learning lessons in life in the end these include such modern classics as american pie theres something about mary and about a dozen examples by judd apatow and co in the last five years however this would be just tooting my own horn and since most of you have seen those movies who gives a rats aso here we have the latest inclusion a comedy about three guys waking up in a terrible in vegas only to realize they have lost the groom along with their memory in a barchelor party gone way out of the map and that they have only about 48 hours to find him and get to the wedding directed by todd phillips who also gave us road trip and which ive always considered superior to american pie for the sake that rt is just more laidbackunlike for example most of apatows comedies the is not smarter than what the premise lets you in on you cant break it down to analyze it because its just what the one  line description says i guess the filmmakers considered two choices rewrite it and force it into the successful apatow mold or play it out like it is like an eighties comedy they did the latter and with that the right choicethe s biggest assets are that its been crafted to the hilt on all distinctive areas  the characters when you meet them at first you go like ok so they are not clear caricatures but how could these guys ever be friends but along the movie you grow into accepting them with their pros and cons you get to recognize their roles and how they complete a full circle without it being too obvious from the getgo huge plusthe dialogue well the usual kevin smithjudd apatow  stuff kind of like friends but with f  words and pop culture references good stuff thoughplot the whole thing plays out like a good mystery and gives a 100 minutes of laughs without missing one beat losing pace or losing focus basically this is what dude wheres my car should have been lets just repeat the thing that really struck me in the there are no lulls this i consider a defining strength when one clue has been solved it moves straight into the next one the okwhat now  bits have been surgically removed also you will not check your watch when the film moves from the second act to the third now this is raregotta hand it also to phillips whose best movie so far and to the cast  along with casting bold having this many new names in key roles8 out of 10 stars hope they wont ruin this with the already greenlit sequel,comedy
ive seen the twice within a week which is a first to me especially with high ticket prices these days it is absolutely the funniest movie of the year and the only competition may come from its sequel only on both occasions that ive seen this the whole audience was loling for the majority of the film i literally cried laughing at the end of the film and most people did as well what made this film so enjoyable and hilarious for me it was the chemistry of the actors real life scenarios and troubles encountered with booze and drugs and the thought of good friends partying in fabulous las vegas this is a comedy you can watch over and over and still get the same reaction every time simply genius,comedy
the is about a group of 4 guys going to las vegas for a bachelor party just two days before the weddingthough bachelor party films are so overdone the puts a fresh spin on the whole concept the delivery of the plot is refreshing i like the way they have to find out what happened the night before as they wake up from their eventful night its so refreshing to see them trying to figure out what they did and to see the shock of what they really did the jokes are phenomenally funny its out of the world basically the film is unbelievably funny you have to see it to believe it,comedy
the is the story of four guys phil the always good bradley cooperis a married teacher that hates his life stu the surprisingly good ed helms from the office is a dentist who are usually prone to suicide stu should be he has a mean cheating slut for a girlfriend and allen zach galifianakiswhos sister is getting marriedthese three guys take their best friend doug the always good justin barthato vegas for the bachaelor partythe next morning they wake up and find that their room is trashed theres a tiger in the bedroom and theres a baby in the closet and that the groom is missing the three guys had some night they stole a police car and mike tysons tiger tyson gives the best cameo of the year stu actually married a stripperheather graham from bowfingerand allen accidentally slipped roofie into their drinksthe date rape drug whys it called roofie if you always end up on the floor thats just a joke from the movie the has everything youd want in a comedy it is my second favorite film of the year every single character in the film is funnybradley cooper ed helms and zach galifanakis should be in more films i cant wait for the sequel in 2011 this movie deserves to be on the top 250 because its on mine its probably on my top ten the is the comedy the world needs and will love,comedy
okay i never expected to like this movie so much for once there is a comedy out there that is actually funnyit keeps you laughing the whole way through i work at a movie theater and i suggest this movie to people every time people of all ages and the tell me how much they loved it no one has told me otherwise so please see it it is funny i promise you thatout of all the comedies i have seen in my seventeen years of lifethat was by far the funniest for sure it is a little gross so i dont suggest taking young kids to see it because it will be a little awkward well i hope those who havent seen it do ,comedy
i had a feeling about this movie from watching the trailers and let me say its the most hilarious movie i have ever seen its escapism at its best who wouldnt want to roll into a movie theater be thoroughly entertained for 100 minutes and literally laugh your ss off so many times you come out feeling like youve done two hours of crunches at the gym the next day its rude its vulgar its raunchy its so so politically incorrect and it doesnt apologize for any of it which i like there are many grains of truth in its absurdity which really is what makes it so funny the cast clicks and the story line while ridiculous is engaging i absolutely loved it id go see it again and it would be just as funny the 2nd timefor those who hated it to each his own thats why some of us like sushi and some cant stand it cest la vie,comedy
the hollywood bachelor night movie genre hasnt brought much glory to the industry this put it all to extremes the guys wake up one morning in las vegas and find a hen a tiger and a sixmonthsyearold baby in their hotel suite but one of the pals is missingthe rest is even more crazy this is a performance in tastelacking but its very funny and the tempo is high the movie is certainly totally of this world but 15 half hour of shallow plain entertainmentlas vegas the myth is once again the main character here but you dont mind since there are absolutely no hangups in this movie absolutely none,comedy
a refreshing change in the story line and a slick cast of characters makes the a mustsee movie the adult fun bordering on the likes of borat makes the movie kind of more a guy movie than a chic movie not that chicks cant dig it but it does have some over the top scenes which may cause severe embarrassment for some the dialogs were quite catchy the acting i thought was quite quite well and galifianakis someone i never knew before this movie came into being is certainly a treat to watch i would rate it to be less funny than superbad but somewhat in par with wedding crashers whatever the case a movie you will want to see again 810,comedy
well the moment you see stars u have not seen too much you tend to avoid the movie i do but this movie is a movie worth watching you start laughing from the first scene itself  i loved this movie cause i could relate to lots of things happening in the movie  i do drink so that was natural  me and my friends were relating each other to the characters in the movie the females might not like the movie due to the type of humor and male dominated plot but they should watch it the actors have done justice to the characters they got  allen specially was the pick of the lotmr chow with his accent was decent enough would recommend this to everyone ,comedy
well i finally got to see the comedy sleeper of the summer the in this one three groomsmen bradley cooper ed helms zack galifianakis are looking for the abouttobewed friend justin bartha after an alcoholinduced bachelor party in las vegas this leads to so many weird twists and turns that listing them here doesnt do them justice lets just say a certain boxer is involved as well as a tiger a baby and an accidental marriage of one of the groomsmen many lines and scenes are both cringe and laughinducing enough that i had a pretty good time throughout by the way i recommend you stay for some of the ending credit sequence and i definitely recommend you watch this quite most hilarious and at times touching movie the ,comedy
tagline most probably the funniest movie of the year review by neo its been a long time coming since i have encountered a genuine comedy that actually makes you laugh out loud at the cinemas it is also been a while since i can recall a hollywood movie that actually got me laughing from start to finish nice shock and an excitement movie to finish off a weekend on a sunday night the trio or foursome if you must include the one on the roof for the majority of the flick performs in an almost faultless manner all the more the three cannot be more different one is with serial player looks one is just a dentist and the other is a brother in law who is just plain fat so much so that the movie didnt seem like a movie as the characters are simple and easy to relate to as the audience goes along the ride with them rather than simply sit and watchthe movie goes like this 4 guys go on a bachelor party two days just before the wedding basically the destination is las vegas and before you know it they are on a rooftop not knowing that the drink they are about to cheers is actually drugged and so they woke up in the villa of caesar hotel with the following items a baby in the wardrobe a tiger in the toilet yes literally a stripper as a wife and the most of all they lost the groom so begins the journey of the three who are totally wasted and do not remember a thing as they stumble here and there to the line of finding a friendusually flicks like these ones the best jokes are already in the trailer but somehow does not contain just a couple of laughs but rather enough laughs to make your stomach burst the fat guy played by zach galifianakis is just so down to earth that it is funny and one of the best lines is certain the caesar one basically he asks so have caesar actually lived in this palace sure it is a damn stupid question but the audience can so feel that he is serious about it that make it more funny than it should be the guy with player looks played by the guy bradley cooper who got scarlett johansson on her knees in he is just not that in you is cool and the way he interacts with others is just seamlessly fun to watch likewise the film cannot be complete without the dentist ed helms the moment his tooth came out and married a stripper he is just a stand down funny guy to endureyou must praise the director todd phillips for the perfect comic timing a film like this can so easily go the wrong track and go the route down the path of films like hot chick but luckily the fun is more on the scale of american pie or kumar castle flick his focus on the characters and allows them to act and interact and play off each other as though they are really friends is really a joy to watch another examples is the enjoyable cameo appearance by heather graham who plays the stripper who married the dentist her line that is so doug works even though she only just met them the night before now thats a sign of cinema magicall in all is a joy to watch a rare piece of cinematic gem adding to the mixture of brilliant chemistry between the costars the liveliness of nightlife in vegas and evolution of down to earth comedy it is a shame that not everyone will relates to the characters but somehow i got a feeling that most of good mates and i included embracing it coming off a trip from the wine district of hunter valley where me and my mates tasted almost all the wines within the 9 wineries along the way is really and is most probably the best comedy of 2009 and if you go in the cinemas with a relaxed mindset i am sure that it will make you smile a little laugh a little and enjoy life a little more  neo 2009 i rate it 910wwwthehkneocom,comedy
the one movie that lives up to its expectations staring an unfamiliar cast to the comedy genre and working on the backdrop of dodonttell las vegas this combination of booze and what to do with your spare time is a masterpiece of the seriously falling comedy genrezach galifianakis stands as the greatest asset to the films success a star willing to do whatever it takes for a laugh and willing to carry a baby on set playing a man whos known for a dangerously dumb mind is classic constructed of colorful and often gutaching characters  mr chow watch out for him  the progress of the is well structured and plays the viewer perfectly as to what might happen next justin bartha as ed stands as the nerd in us all and relates to so many men who want to get out and live their lifeand bradley cooper as phil the one who screws it all up losing his best friend stu is funny enough but when he actually finds where the groomtobe really is plays for an even funnier endingcompiled to have you laughing and crying the flow kills in its comedyfashion and although the film does feature a severe array of frequent language its done so in a passive matteralthough the setback is found in legend mike tyson starring as himself in a relaxed and potentially skittish manner personally the tiger touch was hilarious but mike tyson really didnt do anythingbest scene however had to be the playback where mike tyson shows the boys his video camera from the previous night catching his tiger being kidnapped and sexually assaulted by the drugged drunk and illmannered boysomefoursomethe is a great film funny crazy and a potential party pleaser9  10,comedy
this is the funniest film i have ever seen genuinely i cannot remember laughing so so much while watching a movie ok most comedies advertise themselves as the funniest film ever but this can definitely take that title i dont really go to the cinema very often because no movies have really taken my fancy that much and i also have a busy family life so i entered the theater expecting a few funny moments in the movie but once they started coming they didnt stop i also didnt know who any of the actors were a couple of them i recognized but in general didnt know them ok the film would suit anyone with a sense of humor but would bring out the sense of humor in someone who does not normally show it i will be buying this on dvd as soon as it is out got to be seen to be believed,comedy
we all do dumb s when were fed up concedes a rather sombre mike tyson when reviewing security footage of four random drunkards stealing his tiger and urinating in his pooland its at this moment around twothirds of the way into the bizarre but infectiously humorous trip that is the that everything shifts into place maybe its something to do with the fact that if tyson can sit back and laugh at the absurdities and downright obnoxiously reckless abandon that he witnesses when brought into contact with those guys then we can too i seriously doubt it but the entire expedition that is the is equally asif not moresodubious than seeing a bearded guy get knocked out by the heavyweight boxer to the tune of phil collins in the air tonight but this in no way makes the feature any less entertaining or downright hilarious in fact thats exactly what makes it the romp that it is its silly indulgent and somewhat charred like a barbequed steak mixed with some tough liquor but with a fine ensemble of tangible characters and a pace that keeps things readily engaging and entertaining the is fun fun funand the best thing is that you wont wake up the next day and have forgotten all about ittaking place over the course of two days and nights as three best friends attempt to put the jigsaw pieces of their wild night out in vegas together in order to find their missing friend the is a deliciously simple albeit compelling story striking right at the heart of modern western society and its tendency to do just as these guys do every now and again the majority of todd phillips feature here is steeped in infectious pathos that plays into that everso triedandtrue method of combining observational humour with broad situation farce the result is a story that flows excellently from act to act keeps the jokes and gags steady throughout whilst developing characters and throwing them around often enough to keep the viewer laughing intrigued and laughing some more to be fair there is a certain lack of substance to the overall arc of the adventure penned here by lucas and moore something that is evident in a large portion of their previous works to date that inevitably stops the feature from ever becoming more than a lighthearted buddycomedy but you probably wont notice thanks to lack of pauses in laughter provoked by the script or the actorsat its heart however despite the robustly imaginative and complex intertwining of the central characters journey it is the characters themselves that make the majority of this such a joy to watch while the movie ostensibly revolves around four friends much of the screen time is given to just three of those who share a wonderful chemistry that always feels flesh edgy and natural through the performances of ed helms bradley cooper and zach galifianakis who gets much of the movies laughs as the awkward and weird bearded guy with a baby the buddyroadtrip story that serves as the centrepiece for all their drunken antics missing teeth stolen babies and stun guns to revolve around really hammers home the key narrative that propels things forward and retains the scripts distinctly ychromosomecentric nature sure theres plenty of material here that the ladies of the audience will be able to latch onto but theres no denying the overtly boyish tendencies that rule supreme here that will be sure to give male audiences with a thirst for profane crude comedy the most satisfaction sharp dialogue and genuinely exciting plotting makes this one of this years most remarkable and hilarious comediesa review by jamie robert ward httpwwwinvocusnet,comedy
i have just seen the movie and i have to admit that this is the best comedy so far this year every minute is a belly hurting lough with witty and smart gags acting is brilliant guys really get in to their roles trailer that was shown before does stand up for whole movie if you tend to wake up in the morning not remembering things you did last night you have to see this film as it will reflect yourselfoverral movie is a excellent pieac of comedy that will blow your mind with lots of jokes and amazing acting if you looking for a easy movie to watch and dont want anything deep and meaning go and watch this film as it is pure fun and you will not regret any minute spend afront of the big screen enjoy,comedy
dont be taken by a fool this isnt just another comedy about groomsmen and their night before a wedding its a lot more guaranteed laughs from the beginning until the end and a lot of fun tothe is an excellent example and proof of a comedy that even being very simple can become so big the leading cast of actors searching for their lost friend in a vegas adventure is outrageous bradley cooper gives us the smoothness galifiankis the incoherent genius because of his dumb side colliding with his mathematical characteristics and helms for his brains these three are the key to an excellent ride fulfilled with the most scandalous episodes like the one with mike tyson the fashioned chinese or even the casino scene also other unrevealed and unexplained gags like alans character that isnt allowed to approach a school from a hundred feet or that one time he found a baby in coffee shop turn the vegas trip even more funnyive never seen a comedy like this people were still laughing at the end of the movie and out of the cinema possibly this is one of the greatest comedies which i have ever seen in my entire life and already entered in one of my favorites get to see it if you canits glorious  810,comedy
well basically seen it was a decent movie 710 nothing special was definitely not up to par with pineapple express or half baked or anything like that but was a decent mildly funny movie nothing special reallythe is currently 8410 20849 votes on imdb which of course is not a realistic rating for this movie that isnt even as funny as the naked gun movies which i enjoyed but they werent movie classics like imdb rating system makes this out to be  fear and loathing in las vegas was definitely a top level comedy just so you know my tastes in all these movies to help you tell just where this movie deserves to be in relationsure the jokes were vulgar and such but i aint gonna hate on an artist for expressing creativity or be wild since im a south park and family guy fani think everyone is just hyped and in a good mood for summer and their all in good moods that would be my guess anyways or maybe the movie makers spent a lotta movie to hire people to enter fake imdb ratings i really dont know but take my word for it this movie is generic and mildly funny decently entertaining but nothing special that hasnt been done by 100000 other generic comedies before it and thats the truth of the matter,comedy
after the selfcentered yeehaw ride of 20002008 america wakes up with a massive looming doubt about the future and some confusion about what has just happened gambling debts whoring destroying stuff you cant pay for getting mixed up with the wrong people stealing yup thats what happens when the american middle class mixes the right amount of tradition and cheap oil err i mean whiskey and chemicals as do the characters in this filmfour guys a nerd his brother the groom a teacher and a dentist go to vegas for a bachelor party three wake up to find the groom missing he has been replaced with a tiger and a chicken questhilarity ensue the films main theme might well be that when the social order here marriage is followed out of mere obedience to tradition it is sterile the films ending tries to give that order some kind of organic counterpartthe party and the wedding music and largely succeedsfun thats smart crude and frequently oddly touching one of the better recent comedies and a fairly new entry in its genre take a boygirl to this one and yes ladies this is what happens at bachelor parties at least the ones we dream about,comedy
todd phillips who has been a director who really misses his mark with the exception of old school has landed his footing among comedic filmmakers the is my favorite comedy of the year so far and is sure to become a cult classic among college students and young peoplethe film tells the story of doug justin bartha a middle aged man who goes on a bachelor night with his best friends stu ed helms andy from the office phil bradley cooper and his fiances strange brother alan breakthrough performer zach galifianakis after a night of heavy drinking and waking up to a missing doug the three amigos venture out to find clues to their missing comrade the comedy here is incredible with the raunchy humor that hits and sticks every time the script keeps a great pace and keeps you laughing the whole time helms and galifianakis hit hugely in this film and steal the show every time the never loses sight of its objective and remembers its target audience through the laughs we are immensely stuck on these four guys and their quest to find fallen mate theres actually a wonderful love story wrapped up in all laughs and a wonderful lesson to be learneddont drink jagermeister,comedy
unrememberable that is what s are unrememberable through beers and bars my apologies to nat king cole we have all had them we cant stand them but is a part of paying the piper for the few vivacious hours of liquid festive madness from the previous night s i think hollywood was overdue in providing us a comedic film about them maybe they got hung up with the premise but finally they gave it to us and they did not barf it up with the winning comedy the let me throw you up the plot of this gem three groomsmen and their abouttobewed buddy go to las vegas for a stirring bachelor party phil is the cocky ringleader of this vegasfest and also the best friend of the groomie doug stu is the neurotic dentist buddy who gives his possessive girlfriend muela by lying about where the boys are going for the bachelor festivities alan is dougs soontobe brotherinlaw whos probably gone over the threshold zillions of times in his life thereby explaining his outlandish behavior so these fearsome foursomes drink it up in sin city and before you know it helper gets a service call they wake up the morning after with chaos colliding in their notsolittle caesars palace suite a tiger in the bathroom a stolen police car a baby in the closet a hanging mattress a broken tooth and a missing doug obviously their alcoholinduced memory banks are at zilch so it is oblivious to phil stu and alan how this happened so consequently they need to retrace last nights itinerary of events to find the lost doug i will not seltzer you up whatever that means with more details so you just gotta hang on tight  witness this zany mayhem that is the director todd phillips does phil up this comedic adventure vegas ride with sidesplitting offbeat material that makes you crave for a longer running time bradley cooper as phil had the adequate charismatic pizazz in portraying him zach galifianakis was very belushish as the deranged alan justin bartha as doug was not a barfa of laughs in his supporting role but walked this acting aisle admirably but my favorite thespian performance here was that of ed helms as stu helms stewed it up just right with a perfect blend of comedic acting ingredients so the remedy for your cinematic blues is to catch the before it gets out of your mustsee system  excellent,comedy
i am not a frequent commenter whenever i comment on a film it means i have fallen in love with it it is exactly this situation that i now find myself in  i am in love with this brilliant comedy there is not a single dull moment in this film there isnt a single scene that bores you so even when serious sentences are muttered you can be certain that a glorious joke is soon to come the characters are beautifully unique and perfectly createdthey each have their own personality therefore they all have different humor and that is what makes a great great great comedyand the ending iswelllegendarygo see this film even if youre broke and will not have money left for a diminutive piece of bread trust me on this,comedy

this movie was great i will add that im a 21 year old college female if that validates my review a little more i saw this with my boyfriend completely sober and i loved it it had me laughing from beginning to endmore than most comedies ever make me laugh i dont think its just a frat boy comedy because it has much better jokesits not just beer breasts and sex everywhere the story has a great plot line and the set up is awesome i usually try to find plot holes in movies and i couldnt find anything obvious in this one mr chow is hilarious im asian and he was so stereotypically awful that i couldnt help but laugh especially cause i would only see him naked even though he shows up in clothes later there were some parts that actually had me frustrated and nervous when the fat guy was counting cards im terrible at remember names in movies ha all in allit was worth a midnight movieif youve got a sense of humor and a little bit of an alcoholic in you you can totally relate ,comedy
wow i was completely shocked let me start by saying that reviews for this have perhaps beenfantasies complete fabrication to see this movie and enjoy it you must do two things a be between the ages of 9 and 14 and b watch dude wheres my car instead the is overstuffed with hollywood comedy convention to the point where im sure it will make a couple crafty movie executives a whole lot of money i swear i have seen every scene in this movie in different moviesdifferent in that they are funny if you think youre smart and you want to get a big cheap egoboost from guessing everything thats about to happen in a movie by all means have a ball but i wanted to enjoy this i took my mother to this movie on her birthday sure she loves a good blowjob joke but she cant even look me in the eyes after i actually paid for thisi was laughing here and there at zach galafianakis without whom i would have stabbed someone the actors were doing funny things sure but those were mercilessly edited into absolute garbagepile stinkmachine nothing i liked old school i loved superbad i like a lot of popular hollywood movies im not a snob even if i sound like one i am just so full of fury that there are real people in my hometown who will applaud when something like this occurs in front of their eyes i hope im not being too critical im not,comedy
i think my sense of humor is pretty wide based i loved animal house while i also enjoy subtle less sightgag humor too i can laugh at the three stooges and well as appreciate a woody allen comic view of lifethere was absolutely nothing unique about the whole bachelor party gone bad has be done before and better as well as the whole what happens in vegas stays moviesi had about 3 or 4 good laughs but found the movie forgettable and at times predictable after trying to be so different the ending was a total copout and simply done by the numbers to see this movie in the top rated 250 films here is the biggest laugh this movie actually gave me,comedy
i have been waiting to see the ever since the first trailer came out it looked a great comedy and i was looking forward to seeing it well i finally saw it last night and i must say it was awesome i expected it to be funny but it exceeded even my expectationsthe follows 4 friends celebrating their bachelor party in an outrageous fashion they go to las vegas and are looking forward to having a good time however when they wake up the next morning things arent right one friend is missing one has lost a tooth they find a baby in their hotel room and they cant remember a thing with the wedding coming up in a few days the 3 of them must find their missing friend they spend the movie doing that with hilarious events happening along the wayall of the actors deliver in the film the supporting actors do a fantastic job and mike tyson delivers a great punchline im not talking about a joke as the days go by and the friends continue their search crazy things happen to them each worse then the last with each passing scene the film gets funnier and funnierthe will make you laugh and it doesnt let up on the comedy if you want to have a great laugh this is the film to watch it is easily the funniest film of the year,comedy
great movie about 4 guys going to vegas for a bachelor party they wake up the next morning missing a friend who is going to marry very soon they are going to look for him this will not go so simply because they have forgotten everything so they try to remember by going to all the places en people they have seen the night before i just saw it about 6 hours ago in almerethe netherlands its very hilarious with some very and when i say very i mean very very random things in it some jokes are predictable but that is not annoying sometimes it even makes it better this is a great movie for all guys out there and for some even recognizable,comedy
my husband talked me into this one definitely not a chick flick the female characters are either strippercall girls or bitches even from a story standpoint its weak if youre going to have boys night out or in this case the morning after boys not out lets see a little more of what happened lots of chatting of how wild and crazy they got but i was drawn in by it unfortunately after being enticed a big no show typical of men all talk and no go what happened they ran over budget so all the best scenes they just blab about and cover up with a series of digital pictures if boys will be boy at least go for it and show it it was like they went to one scene to the next talked about how crazy a segment was realize what happened and then move on without showing it with the exception of two moments it was mostly talk and no show sorry boys next time if youre going to get your audience excited at least give us something to talk about after wards and fyi even my husband was disappointed he didnt get to experience the night with the boys the pictorial didnt cut it,comedy
the is a bumpy raucous raunchy road tripits also pretty forgettablea couple of bufferins and youll be ready for the next comedy why do movies about overindulgence have to be overindulgent i get a kick in the comic solar plexus from reviewers who call the and its ilk instant classics they must have seen only one or two movies in their meager critical careers they certainly dont know what classic is and they dont seem to know comedy if something is supposed to be humorous they laugh like reflexive audience members but intention is not executionread the complete review httptonymacklinnetcontentphpcid240tony macklin httptonymacklinnet,comedy
i really dont there were some chuckle points but for the most part i thought this movie was boring unless this was a stoner film then a few things make more sense but i still found this movie boring movies are meant to entertain but i sure as hell didnt find this movie entertaining its more of an insult to heavy drinkers1 nobody noticed the groomtobe when they pulled the mattress from the roof 2 how is moving a tiger funny 3 how is seeing a naked asian funny 4 the sackless guy who was afraid of his fianc didnt bother to bring the photo album from the chapel 5 what kind of retard brings a camera to a bachelor partyi recommend that anybody who hasnt seen this film watch it once then get wasted to forget such a crapfest,comedy
saw this on a ba jet flying to coincidentally las vegas on the day the underpants bomber roasted his nuts and if anything it proved there are worse things than a three hour delay and intrusive body searchesi understand airlines edit the movies they show but i can only assume every funny line in the uncut version was accompanied by gratuitous sex scenes nudity or extreme violence because they sure werent in the version i saw the only mildly amusing line was jeffery tambors comment about what goes on in vegas stays in vegas at the beginningpredictable line up of groom alpha male hen pecked nerd and fat beardy loser take the fatherinlaws prized vintage mercedes uhoh to vegas for the stag night and after a booze and drug fuelled rampagewhich you dont see try to piece together what happened in an attempt to find the missing groomclues are provided so easily that it makes scooby doo look like a major forensic investigation along the way there is an encounter with a camp asian gangster yawn a tiger in the bathroom thats acted out in way that suggests its an everyday occurrence a deus exmachina scene where the beardy fat loser is now some kind of rainman at blackjack followed by a oh i remember where we put him ending so lame its almost in a wheelchairworst of all mike tyson is roped in as the tigers owner in a scene that goes nowhere its debatable whether he is more ashamed about being a convicted rapist or acting in this rubbishvery very poor,comedy
i am a little surprised that this movie has averaged such high reviews it seems to be universally well reviewed on the web and many people i know that have seen it have highly recommended it this may be the main reason why i was so disappointed but overall i thought it was quite an average roadtripgonewrong type of movie and would have rated it as i have regardless i certainly didnt experience the laughaminute entertainment that others have mentioned a faint chuckle here and there but thats about itnow i dont mind the odd farfetched silly movie so im not a prude when it comes to this type of genre the premise of the movie had potential but the execution just didnt quite cut it for me for starters the acting was mediocre that was bad acting came to mind in several scenes some of the situations were a little overthetop juvenile and lacking in comedy the cops with the tasers is just one of many examples if youre into kicked in the nuts kind of humor then you may find this really funny but only barely made me grinnot the worst comedy ive seen and overall wasnt a totally unenjoyable experience but certainly for me not worthy of the hype it is receiving,comedy
firstly i must admit i saw this movie with high expectations  everybody kept saying how funny this movie is so i was prepared to laugh for 90 minutes but now im very disappointedi liked the idea 4 men go to las vegas for a crazy night and end up losing the groom they cant remember anything and have to put the puzzle back together and find the groom before the wedding sounds funny already right but it wasnt funny okay there were a few laughs and overall it was an entertaining movie but absolutely nothing specialthe movie had so many story lines that could have made it very funny first there was this baby and they had no idea whose was it but the baby was there for 15 min and nothing funny happened the tiger  also nothing exciting what was the point of mike tyson phil being in the hospital  they said that the pictures would explain it but im sorry i didnt get it stu lost his tooth and the reason was mentioned once i didnt like the place where they finally found doug  who was red now because he had spent 2 nights on the roof  he could have easily saved himself from there just by screaming they never gave us a timeline of the events  how and when everything exactly happened it would have been nice to see everything  maybe as flashbacks or fast forward in the end of the movie ps how did the chicken get there the characters were too stereotypical  alan as this crazy guy who never had had friends before phil as the guy who only wanted to party stu as this man who was terrorized by his girlfriend and finally starts dating a stripper and doug im sorry but doug was so boring and unmemorable that theres nothing to say about himthis movie tried to be everything and it failed,comedy
okay its about a stag night that goes wrong four thirtysomething lads are heading out to the city of sin las vegas  when they awake the next morning things have gone badly wrong but they cant remember any of it and have to retrace their stepsi enjoyed it enough but it didnt quite hit the spot somehow i felt judd apatow knocked up 40 years old virgin forgetting sarah marshall would have made it work better it has the flavour of ferris buellers day off but we dont quite get time to know the characters and the humour is a bit broad a bit obvious in that its designed to evoke the audience sympathies ooh one of their friends is a bit weird with a horrid beard and lets his pants hang down of his backside hes not allowed to be near schools it seems what a character yawn none of the actors are really comic actors i didnt quite warm to them towards the end of the film it loses touch with any semblance of reality unlike kids movies like risky business or ferris bueller where you had your heart in your mouth towards the finalewhat it did have in common with apatows films is the vein of misogyny he gets accused of all of the women are shrews bar the happy hooker in vegas played inevitably by heather grahamgreat soundtrack vegas looks terrific but not a hugely endearing film,comedy
it took a while for me to build sympathy for the characters the action starts slow too i guess they could have shortened the first half hour or so some of the fun things we are seeing later arent explained to satisfaction how they end up as they are going to is explained deusexmachinastylequite lame sadly some fun stuff some childish scarymovietype of jokeswhile this is an entertaining flick i dont understand how it wound up on 130 better than snatch big lebowski et al no way in my opinion this is one of the better comedies of the last several years but that is about it  especially since the best part of the movie comes with the credits so much stuff you could have exploited in the movie itself oh and you can see a boobie of that chick from scrubs thats a big plus,comedy
oh my god just saw this tonight and it was true comedy geniusone of the funniest films i have ever seen and definitely the funniest of the yearthe cast are all fantastic in their roles some of the cameos are brilliantsome of the stuff that happens in the film is just crazy and random but it just makes it even funnierif you see one comedy this year make it this one you wont regret going to see itoh and make sure you watch the beginning of the credits and dont walk straight out its really funny,comedy
two days before his wedding doug justin bartha drives to las vegas with his best buddies phil and stu bradley cooper ed helms and his future brotherinlaw alan zach galifianakis for a blowout bachelor party they vow theyll never forgetbut when the three groomsmen wake up the next morning with pounding headaches they cant remember a thing their luxury hotel suite is beyond trashed and the groom is nowhere to be foundwith no clue about what happened and little time to spare the trio must attempt to retrace their bad decisions from the night before in order to figure out where things went wrong in the hopes of finding doug and getting him back to la in time for his weddingbut the more they begin to uncover the more they realize just how much trouble theyre really in the 1010,comedy
jon lucas  scott moore have written a delightful comedy i liked the movie better than the title given todays marketplace of coming of age comedies teen comedies young adult comedies and just plain old comedies the succeeds it doesnt have the novelty effect of 40 year old virgin or of the wedding crashers but still i thought it was enjoyable to watchthe actors live up to the well written script bradley cooper ed helms zach galifianakis justin bartha heather graham sasha barrese jeffrey tambor work very well together as well as with the director todd phillipsas the director phillips does a very nice job of having his actors involved in comedic antics while moving the story along at a nice pace i believe that it was at the top of the charts when it first opened and that it has been doing pretty well since,comedy
i noticed that this movie was lingering in the top 250 movies so i decided to take a look the film is very much along the lines of a farrelly brothers movie and follows a bachelor party in las vegas three of the four middle aged guys wake up and have no recall what happened the night before they have lost the groom and they need to try to piece together what happened during the previous night the humour in the movie is very base but the story does zip along i found a couple of the visual jokes very funny and it was very lighthearted throughout i probably will not remember a thing about it in a few months but it was a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours it seems the director todd phillips will provide competition for the farrellys in the future,comedy
after a wild bachelor party 3 friends wake up in a destroyed room and discover that their friend the groom is missing now they must retrace their steps from the night that they cant remember in order to get him back to the wedding the next daythis premise is just an excuse for some wild and random comedic scenarios such as having a tiger be in your bathroom when you wake up the joy of watching this film is seeing just how many crazy things come next all of which the characters have no memory of what makes the work so well is not just those random comedic scenarios but the cast that blended so well together specifically zach galifianakis whom has been the audience favouriteas the film progresses the characters find themselves getting into some serious situations due to their antics the night before i want say what happens as each one if funny and should be watched with surprise it easy to say that this film will not bore you it does have a particular comedic style though and you can judge yourself if youll be into it or not from the trailer todd phillips of oldschool fame has his funniest movie here both road trip and oldschool were good yet were missing something that made me really love it the has this something its not a teen comedy road trip nor is it a star powered film old school it uses familiar faces that make you go ive seen him before but never do these actors overshadow the film had it of been a bigger name cast it wouldnt have worked so wellthe three friends are played by ed helms the uptight dentist bradley cooper the suave smooth talker and zach galifianakis the odd brother in law the groom is played by justin bartha the national treasure sidekick its easy to say the galifianakis steals the show its obvious he will garner more roles from this i just hope he doesnt get pigeonholed into this style he reminds me of chi mcbride and i want him to branch out before its too late michael cera helms and cooper also hold up nicely im familiar with helms from the office and daily show fame and cooper from previous films has always been likable bartha isnt in the film that much since most of it is them looking for the guythe also doesnt suffer from the one thing that seems to kill so many comedies over exposed trailer yes weve all seen the mike tyson bit but the film has so many random bits of comedy that you will enjoy yourself throughout the running time if the film does fault its with the character of mr chow i like ken jeong but here he plays the character way over the top and it becomes distracting heather graham makes an appearance as well and as she does with almost every role she takes on you see her boobies well one boobthe film is funny i was entertained and i expect to see good things from galifianakis its vulgar and obscene and dont expect to see much heart near the end or a good message like apatow films do while it does have that one scene in which one character stands up for himself it doesnt try to throw any real messages out the audiencemake sure you stay for the first bit of the credits as the laughs dont stop,comedy
i must have read a halfdozen reviews of this movie before seeing it my wife and i were in need of a few good laughs but instead we struggled for every one i frankly cant imagine a more damning criticism my expectations had been wildly off the mark the players were pleasant enough but not particularly engaging or worth as much time as given to them here allen though overthetop was my favorite as the bearded somewhat sappy goofball he was fun to listen to and watch for a while but the storyline was not very impressive and seemed to have been written by someone in high school it just tries way too hard to be cute probably one of its better points is it didnt denigrate or belittle any particular ethnic group to the contrary one of its obvious intentions is a strangely lowkey and stealth attempt to put in a good word for jews as i guess fairly ordinary funloving people it did take a shot at gays however and mike tyson probably without realizing it is made to mimic a fairly recent european commercial where an ape plays the drums to a familiar song whose title i cant remember if i were the producers id pray mike doesnt find out about that,comedy
i found reading the reviews of this movie more entertaining than the movie itself yeah there are some funny moments but for the most part it just overpromises and underdelivers there are so many elements to the story that go too far over the top but dont have enough absurdity or humour to make it work there are plenty of comedies that are more outrageous than this one but they pull it off because they have the comic delivery to make us laugh enough that we just dont care in the case of the the delivery is just not funny witty or foolish enough to make any of the major comic devices work as a result most of the content just seems gratuitous and annoying and falls really flatthe is watchable enough and you will laugh a couple of times but dont let the overthetop reviews fool you its just not that great unoriginal and stupid in a bad wayone last thing please people stop comparing this to wedding crashers its not anywhere near as funny or as well executed youre just embarrassing yourselves,comedy
phil bradley cooper stu ed helms and alan zach galifianakis wake up in las vegas hotel room with no memory of what happened the night before during their bachelor party the problem is they lost the bachelor doug justin barthatheres a tiger a bunch of pictures and a baby all that is fun flashing lights but its the chemistry of the three that makes this movie zach galifianakis breakout performance is hilarious but it means nothing if bradley cooper and ed helms wasnt there bradley is a great leading man and ed is able to balance out zachdirector todd phillips really had the group humming he has built up a nice resume of funny comedies also ken jeong literally jumps out onto the world,comedy
i know a lot of people love this movie but for me not so much dont get me wrong its funny some what still its just has that stupid humor that reminds me of another similar movie 2000s dude where is my car its not that different from other drunk comedies instead of a car they are missing the groom to be doug justin berta also why is there a tiger in the bathroom a baby in the hotel room and one of them is missing a tooth now the other three men deemed to be call the wolf pack must find the groom and retraces their steps from the night before when their las vegas bachelor party went horrible wrong they must figure how all these things came into play first off there is alan garner zach galifianakis the social inept who both alternately creepy and hilarious stupid at the same time its not like he is that funny he just like any other fat stupid guy in a comedy i can name at less two dozen comedies with fat guys just like his character then there is stu price ed helm the dorky dentist who always end up taking the most chaotic change in his life in this type of movies last is the selfcentered phil wenneck bradley cooper who pretty much plays the straight man in these comedies in their adventures they encounter colorful characters like smartmouth cops a sleazy owner of a quickie wedding chapel and mike tyson the problem is that the movie does nothing but string together a series of gags either crude or violent or both that grow more and more depressing the clearer it becomes that everything about the movie is shallow phony and clich its not new honestly what type of valet would drive a beat up police cruiser to the front of a hotel when they ask for their mercedes wouldnt he think something is odd by that honestly what type of hotel wouldnt notice such outrageous act going on without calling the cops i think its would be funnier if its more realistic things happen rather than things that wouldnt happen in real life i surprised that the police or the hotel staff wouldnt had investigates until the last minute the source of the damage honestly i thought it would be funnier if they went to jail for their crimes i wish i can escape jail time if i steal a police cruiser while high on rohypnol by doing a taser demonstration but in real life i will probably be seeing 20 to 30 years jail sentences for something like that the hype about this movie was kinda overrated i think the reason why it was so enjoyable to some people because they saw it when they were probably high or drunk while the movie says they were drugged the title says otherwise its about drinking its didnt feel funny if you were watching it sober its just the fact that this is a film is about getting drunk that most people would see it probably are drunk while watching hints why they thinks its awesome honestly people that has something against drinking shouldnt watch it because it makes drinking too much look cool people that do drink shouldnt act like these fools on film there is nothing funny at being a alcoholic child its not fun babysitting drunk people there are various types of humor out there but not everyone likes all types of humor i think comedies need to have a subcategory according to the type of humor to help people to further identify if they like it or not and this is not my type of humor i found bridesmaids funnier than this while that may have been perverted as well but the acting and comedy were actually very funny its more realistic in tone overall director todd phillipss is over the top frat boy humor who opening was very slow hard time building up the plot and lacks any sense of smart humor outside of dumb dark humor and jackass violence behavior its funny if you like dumb manchild type humors movies if not this isnt your type of a film youll just feel pain like a ,comedy
while not entirely awful i did laugh 5 times this comedy is more likely to appeal to young teenagers the best comedies are those where realistic things happen but a tigers in the bedroom b winning 80k dollars at blackjack c smartening up for the wedding having tuxes delivered while on the road d an asian gangster e putupon dentist marries a hot stripper the black doug was telegraphed too the saving grace was the dental guy who was the only character that developed through the film and came out the other side with something about him the short fat guy was just irritating and entirely not funny the police station scene was amusing this film is hugely overrated and i certainly wont be bothering with part 2 incredibly my other half who i never expected to like this did enjoy it rating it 7 out of 10,comedy
this will probably be deleted because i am going to insult a lot of people anyone who thinks that this movie is at all funny is either a a kid who doesnt know how to think or b a moron the jokes are either just not funny reused from other movies or completely inappropriate the stuff with the tiger is directly ripped off from tommy boy zach galifiniakis is not funny bradley cooper is a douchebag and anyone who thinks a baby making perverse hand gestures is funny just needs to be shot seriously the world is better off without you this is quite possibly the worst movie ever made but because our world is full off mindless losers who dont know how to think for themselves the studio convinced you that it is funny oh wellheres hoping the mayans were right for some at least,comedy
just when i was starting to think i lost my sense of humor along came the ive been getting an uneasy feeling over the last decade that comedy is a dead genre the ones that achieve any kind of critical acclaim are either mixed genre and dramedies like little miss sunshine or juno and ive enjoyed some absurdist films like the ones of wes anderson but strict comedies have been hijacked by the likes of adam sandler will farrell and  horror of horrors  friedberg and seltzer these are crude comedies that rely on grossout humor and very cheap laughs while dismissing everything else that makes a movie watchable not since the late 90s have i truly enjoyed a comedy purely for the laughs was something wrong with me the was a big surprise  at first glance it looked a lot like those grossout comedies that are everywhere to be found indeed todd phillips doesnt shy away from crude sexual and physical humor  which can be seen as early as his forgettable debut road trip but the has some other things that road trip didnt  good pacing solid characters with interesting interactions and genuinely funny moments the humor is still mostly physical but the story manages to grab the viewers attention and the farout jokes fit right in rather than being tacked on its a rare species these days  a strict comedy which is truly funny and truly entertaining i dont think i saw a pure comedy this funny since 1999s office spacethe isnt a masterpiece of course  its a formula movie and it embraces that formula whole heartedly the characters are all familiar stereotypes but theyre written well enough and their interactions interesting enough that they feel real and compelling in the same way the editing cinematography music etc are solid and built on wellfounded and welltested formulae that keep the viewer involved without distracting the style never taking over the substance its a classic comedy with no artistic pretenses but with plenty of laughs comparable with john landis at his best and its a real joy to see a movie like this can still be made today,comedy
the is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen its clever crazy and never leaves the viewer boreddoug justin bartha is getting married and his friends want to take him to vegas for a bachelor party phil bradley cooper is a brash teacher desperate for fun stu ed helms is a dentist with a horribly controlling girlfriend and alan zach galifianakis isdougs bizarre brotherinlaw to be the night looks like it will be awesome but things get crazy when stu phil and alan wake up the next morning to a trashed hotel room complete with a chicken tiger and baby not only that but stu is missing a tooth and doug is nowhere to be found so the three guys set off to find out where their friend is who the baby belongs to and how the tiger ended up in their bathroom the guys then go on a crazy twoday adventure figuring out what exactly they did that fateful night and how to fix everything in time for dougs weddingthis film is just hilarious theres no other word to describe it the guys get into crazy situations with weird twists and turns that are just confusing to the viewer as the characters along with the great characters and plot the is chock full of great one liners and memorable quotes if youre in the mood for a hilarious adult comedy the is a real good time,comedy
the is a hilarious movie with a well thought out storyline and a great main castzach galifanakised helms and bradley cooper are all a delightthe movie is laugh out loud funny from the very beginning to the very end and it is also surprisingly cleveralan is my favourite character in the movieeverything he says is very quotable and he is without a doubt one of the best comedy movie characters of all timefans of rude comedies like old school or superbad will love the four friendsdougphilstu and alan head off on a bachelor night in vegas before doug gets marriedthey wake up the next morning with no memory of the following nighttheres a tiger and a baby in there hotel room and doug is missingthey must retrace there steps to find doug and find out what else happened that night,comedy
i liked this film i thought it was clever and original it had a good storyline and some very good actors in my opinion zach galifianakis as alan was my favourite i thought that it was funny but i dont think it was as hilarious as everyone was making it out to be it had good character build up and you really empathised with some of the characters i liked it but i didnt think it was the funniest film i have ever seen but im not disputing it was funny overall i would say that the is a funny film with some good actors that is definitely worth a watch if you want an easygoing laid back film that you just want to laugh at i would rate it 8510 and say that it is suitable for anyone mature 13,comedy
time and again the audience has proved fresh thoughts and new ideas are lapped up with immense joy and the successometer of the is the proof it goes without saying that the writing takes the crowning glory very smart quite clever intelligent and definitely outofbox thinking translated into pen and paper the four lead characters are so distinctly separate that everyone carves a niche in your head bradley phil cooper the superconfident hulk obviously gets icing on the cake with the length of the screen time ed stu helms leaves an impression on how a typical alphamale transforms into a prey to the bdsm acts of the oppressor to the point its become an acquired taste zach alan galifianakis is a lovable character whom you would love to hate but later unveils his hidden talent justin doug bartha the bachelor who makes everybody do a chickenrun is found only in the beginning and in the end heather graham has a limited screen time and she doesnt miss the opportunity to popout her hidden talent jeffrey tambor as the wouldbe fatherinlaw leaves an impression and yes mike tyson is a bonus in the moviethe good thing about the screenplay is the blacks out portions of the bachelors party which builds up the suspense quite effectively a few snaps as the credit rolls attempts to provide few clues though some good oneliners and a few memorable scenes are bound to be topics of watercooler discussionhere hoping the sequel manages to raise the bar yet again  fingers xed,comedy
the is one of the few comedies that manages to be funny all the way through aside from the funniness which points to the good writing and acting it actually does a very good job at describing the experience of being that mashed and in that sense has a seriously good side toodo not watch it if youre easily offended if youre not easily offended and you havent seen it you have a treat in store its not necessarily a guy film either a bit like forgetting sarah marshall isnt necessarily a girl film they are just both very funny films2 is out late may 2011 and ill watch it for sure if its half as good as the first itll be twice as good as most comedies,comedy
one of the best comedies ive ever seen just funnier than superbad movie zach galifianakis is incredible in this movieif you want to laugh a lot watch it now i dont understand what is wrong with some people really who gives one for this movie must have some serious mental disease or somethingyou that like to read reviews before watching the movies dont believe in the people that hated this movie its really a masterpiece and probably one of the funniest movies ever madeif you didnt watch it yet run and watch itthats classic,comedy
the is proudly a film that does not follow the footsteps of those college and break up films like forgetting sarah marshall and old school that is being overused nowadays and is rapidly becoming a bore but now we have a dirty rude hilarious film called the it is one of those films that seem worthless but instantaneously from the first scene becomes a destined classic comedy that takes up your number one spot on your top 5 comedy list it is a film with a stupid plot that quickly changes into a film with matter of fact unbelievable twists and action not to mention the slick hilarious continuous sick stunts and jokes the film was probably the most deserving of its award at the oscars for best comedy or musical because with a movie like this it can definitely go wrong in a good way one extra award should have been given out for zach galifianakis for his priceless role as alan garner ps i am definitely not exaggerating when i say that he should have won an oscar damn you oscars todd phillips is my new director to look at out for and he obviously has some great films under his title here i come road trip a director like him is very rare nowadays because he is someone who never hides or thinks something is inappropriate for the eyes he is one of a kind his camera angles are impeccable the acting cast did a brilliant job of making this riot come to life and the four main actors were perfect for their roles i havent seen much of bradley cooper on film with the exception of hes just not that in to you which he acted great in but after watching him in the i have to say that this man has some great talent to showoff he left a great impression on me and i have to get the ateam just for him bradley cooper is playing phil wenneck a school teacher who has the same maturity level as his students when he is with his pals is one of the unlucky friend that goes to vegas for the worst two days of his life ed helms is surprisingly quite funny for a geeky dentist that can get pretty wild at parties especially when he is drunk and he looks tougher than he actually is he is another unfortunate soul ed helms has a great transformation from a dentist who is under the rule of his soontobe fiance to a newly made man in real life ed helms is quite cool and with playing a dentist with no balls he is someone to look out for justin bartha national treasure i and ii is doug billings a soontobe husband who is ready for the time of his life too bad he didnt see this whole thing coming justin bartha has changed a lot from the last time we saw him in national treasure he still felt a little out of his place the main star of the show is zach galifianakis who plays the hilarious alan garner the brother in law of doug phillips and who has an addiction for trusting druggies the whole shtoad of trouble starts when he puts roofies into each glass of wine that he brought from a druggie who seemed trustworthy he is the landmark of stupidfunny characters in films like these that the laughter flows out from he is the fat part of this film and also the immaturity as well i do not know how zach made this guy come to life and how he gathered up all the energy anyways zach is a gifted actor that belongs into the mensa of films well done the rest of the cast is historysince the plot is too complicated and funny to comprehend i took the liberty of copying this straight from imdb just two days before his marriage with tracy garner doug billings in the company of two friends phil wenneck and stu price and tracys eccentric brother alan head out to party in vegas driving his fathers mercedez they rent a pricey villa at caesars and head for the rooftop to have a good time three of them later wake up with a unable to recollect what exactly happened with the villa in a wreck turned upside down they find that they have a baby in the closet a grown tiger in the bathroom stu has a missing tooth and a hooker for a bride and doug is missing hilarious chaos results as the trio head out to retrace their steps find out that occurred in order to try and locate doug and bring him home in one piece before the weddingthe film has a cameo by mike tyson who is a fierce little fella and he lights the screen on fire once he makes an appearance the punch must have hurt when alan got it the film has too many classic scenes and it would be very hard if not impossible to choose one but there are some scenes which stand out from the rest the whole alan making the baby look like it is jerking off is stuck in my mind for days and i laugh whenever it is thought off i laugh in the classroom in sleep even in the toilet the ending which i wont certainly not spoil is also very funny because it outlines the stupidity that the bunch had to go through after realizing lets leave it at that the film amazes me when i think of the r18 rating it got because the film had hardly any nudity to what you might expect but the foul language and the offensive acts fill that up in a flash this is a must recommend for comedy fans who are looking for the word originalityover and out 10th june 2010,comedy
i wasnt going to watch this movie because normally films of this type are an utter waste of timehowever after a few minutes it caught my interest and i ended up watching the whole thingit wasnt rolling on the ground funny but it was outrageous and interesting enough to draw me in and make me want to see the ultimate conclusioni could identify with the characters and have had a few vegas nights where i woke up wondering where the heck my pants wereto the naysayers if you are looking for something witty and cerebralforget itjust relax and enjoy the silliness,comedy
hello everybody this weekend i saw the the film centers on four best friends phil wenneck played by bradley cooper stu price ed helms alan garner zach galifianakis and doug billings justin bartha who all travel to las vegas to celebrate dougs bachelor party before he gets married but the morning after they wake up to a massive and for some reason they cant remember anything from last night and whats worse it turns out they have lost doug they find out that the reason why they cant remember anything is because they were slipped roofies they have to retrace all of their steps from the twelve hour period that they have no memory of to find dougand the film is absolutely hilariousthe script is creative inspired and brilliantly structured the film is occasionally very random but its still so funny the film is very well paced and isnt hindered by slow pace that the first few minutes does suffer from a bitthe performances are great in this movie cooper helms and galifianakis all play off of each other so well as an ensemble theyre the three best friends that anyones ever had d  and just as good separately along with justin bartha as well theyre all supported by some great cameos from heather graham jeffrey tambor ken jeong rob riggle and mike tyson among othersoverall thoughts the films strongest benefits are from its creative and hilarious screenplay and performancesthe movie gets  out of  from me,comedy
i have never laughed in a cinema so much in my lifethis movie is everything i want in a comedy i think the reason i find it go good is because we all have had a at one time or another in our life and we know the feeling of not being able to remember anything so from the moment ste wakes up on the apartment floor with thatwhat the hell is going on look on his face i was howling with laughter and from there it just got better and betteralan garner is a absolute legendhe is defo top dog when it comes to the laughs in this picture you have got to see this film and laugh your ass off as i said before the greatest and best comedy i have ever seenhands down10 out of 10also the slideshow at the end pure gold,comedy
director todd phillips knows how to make a good original story and make it his own with the phillips proves that he does not need famous actors to make a fun comedy that shows to be a good time phillips first shows this by having only semifamous actors play the four main charactersbradley cooper who appears in wedding crashers and yes man plays phil a married man who takes his buddy out to las vegas for a bachelor party ed helms who is most famous as andy bernard from the office plays stu a dentist who calls himself a doctor justin bartha from the national treasure movies plays doug the man who is getting married zach galifianakis steals the show as alan who thinks of phil stu and doug as his best friends alan says and does the dumbest stuff but galifianakis pulls it off and makes alan believablemany people know who heather graham is and she is brilliant as jade the stripper who marries stu while they are wasted in another brilliant part is ken jeong who plays a mob boss that is angry with the guys mike tyson also makes a hilarious cameoas the scenes and the story unfold phillips puts us with the guys as we try to figure out what happened to the guys and makes us want to know just as badly as the guys do phillips decides that we as an audience should try and figure out how and when everything happened this is some brilliant work by phillips as he puts us involved in the moviei also like that the director doesnt just give away the ending phillips knows how to make the characters believable and keep the story compelling this is his best movie to date and he proves that he can get semifamous actors and make them good,comedy

ridiculous movie with one basic thing going for it the plot is so off the wall that it actually becomes funnier as the picture goes onthree guys take their friend for a weekend in las vegas from california the guy is supposed to get married when the groomtobes brotherinlaw who is totally offthe wall drugs the other guys the film goes into an odyssey of what the 3 guys go through trying to find their lost friend we see them interacting with drug dealers playing 21 at the gambling tables meeting up with mike tyson and his tiger and all other forms of ridiculous adventures yet believe it or not the film is humorousbradley cooper steals the show as phil the california teacher who curses repeatedly and heads the group consisting of a dentist the zany grooms intended brotherinlaw and our intended groom the latter who has gone missing through most of the filmits rare that a zany comedy works now but this film actually does,comedy
i saw the movie twicefirst timei saw it alone and found it amusing but was kinda disappointed because i expected a much funnier film and i was annoyed with the weaker parts of the ploti found the chinese guy trying too hard to be funny and rather fakein particular stilli was entertainedi think the music in the film is well chosen and no one can denie there is a lot of originality in this movienot all those clichs that we are forced to see in comedy films this last couple of yearsrecentlyi saw the movie againthis time with my friendsi didnt remember it well so i realized i hadnt seen it carefully the first time i laughed out loud a lot which i dont do that easilyadmittedlythe atmosphere was cheerfulhaving friends overwe had a lot of fun this time i didnt notice the weaker parts in the movie and i didnt look for themthe movie is funnyit doesnt have a lot of lame or already seen jokesit has a lot of unexpected events and i liked the charactersbradley coopers bitter school teacher who still knows how to have funed helms henpecked stuzach galifianakiss alanweird and uncomfortable but funnythe actor had perfect timing and justin barthas douga normal guy who actually got together the other 3 completely different guysheather grahams jane is also likableif you want to see a good comedyand you havent seen the rent itget itsee it if you look closelyyoull get more than just a comedy if you just want to relaxget it again this is one of those comedies that people will see in 10 years each time its onthe next weekend at berniesa surprising summer hit we always tune in to watchbut the is deeper and more hilariousimo dso just watch itforget about the hypethe criticsthe good and the bad reviewsthe movie is original enough to give it the benefit of the doubt forget your expectations and prejudices and just watch it it will be worth it,comedy
oh my god i have seen a lot of funny movies but this is the best it might have parts inappropriate for younger people and sometimes it really makes you think but this is the best movie ive ever seen and ive seen a lot of comedies it has many memorable quotes like not at the table carlos or when alan hits the baby with the door and asks if his glasses are ok and stu goes yeah you dick you will laugh your head off i cannot say enough how funny this movie is i wont lie if your easily offended you might not want to watch it but if you have a slight bit of demented humor you will find this movie to be a great choice,comedy
this has got to be the best comedy roadmovie ever i can not remember another movie that made me laugh more the story is so whack without going into detail that it becomes plausible people get married all the time and they all have bachelor partiesunless youre sad and have no friends of course this is the ultimate male bachelorparty and it even has a happy ending the casting is perfect 4 types of guys thrown into it this is how comedy should be to complement the feel of the movie the music fits like a glove i soo hope there will be a movie just like it  maybe a sequelbut those are tricky when the first one is awesomeif this movie doesnt make you at least giggle or more likely lol lmao you need counseling for not having a sense of humor,comedy
well structured action genuinely funny performances and script the kind of comedy you would recommend to everyone without reservations what really makes a difference here is the chemistry of the characters if you just take a quick look at them you will see no possible way of coexistence yet they not only almost miraculously manage to survive each other but their experience works like a bonding factor bradley cooper as the voice of reason and zach galifianakis deliberately trying to make everyones life miserable with his brilliant ideas is called flawless casting its the kind of comedy we hadnt seen since well i have no idea when the last time i watched something equally funny was enjoy,comedy
my review i gave the a 8 out of 10 i thought this movie was excellent on the point of setup everything that would be previewed within the movie would come back with conclusive endings to what was previously revealed from past parts of the movie nothing was left out the movie was absolutely hilarious it almost defines the word i thought this movie topped superbad and i never thought that could be done cause in my opinion superbad was the funniest movie ive seen in awhile until of course ive seen the in the not only was a lot of these actions that was visible hilarious a lot of the lines were right on target and what i mean by that is in other comedy movies they would try and say some line and it would be totally random and it would supposed to be funny but in fact it is not and makes no sense at all that rarely happens within this movie almost every line is agreeable and will produce a laugh from you this movie will be an instant classic in many cases my rating and reasoning 810 this movie was very funny one of the best comedies i have seen since superbad i cant say this is an absolute perfect and complete comedy and thats why it did not receive a 10 from me but i tell you it is close to it it could had just a little bit more put into some things to make it a perfect comedypositives and negatives very funny lines and actions everything fell into place perfectly throughout the movie some of the lines and actions were kind of stupid and unrealistic i dont like things like that and i always take off for it  there could have been a little bit better acting in it for example the hotel checkin lady lisa i thought she did an horrible job actingmy favorite characters allan and philmy favorite random moment when allan wakes up and stumbles over everythingmy favorite line when chao stomps on allans satchel and he says  hey  there are skittles in there  my favorite moment when their all sitting at the table and allan acts as if the baby carlos tyler is pleasuring itself by moving his hand in the motionrecommend this movie yes most definitely if you havent seen this it follows in the mustsee categoryfinal word i am absolutely stoked for the 2 to come out im curious to see how the story will take place from where it left off its gonna be hard to top this but it will be possibly great also,comedy
love this filmyou might think the reviews hype movies up and then when you see it its not as good as you expected well that is not the case for this filmi think this modern classic will get oscar nominations for best writing lose to qt best picture lose to inglorious basterds and possibly a best director win maybe i know its abit of a stretch but i reckon it can do it i know this isnt going to happen but i would love for zach galifianakis to get nominated but sadly it wont happenzach galifianakis is the best character in this cult film everything he says is a stitch his highlight is the wolf pack speech be prepared to fall of your chair when you watch that particular scene the other two actors bradley cooper ed helms are fantastic too this film turned bradley into a leading actor and is staring in this years the a team and ed helms his character is hilarious in the us officeduring this film the three main characters go to vegas for a stag night and get really drunk and lose the groom they go on a hilarious journey around vegas to get him to his wedding the go around vegas and meet very humorous people then finally spoiler alart they find doug on the roof and race to get him to his wedding he gets there just in time and gets marriedi strongly recommend this to any body it will crack you up,comedy
to begin with i just have to state that it has been a really long time since i laughed as much as i did while watching the and i am a film addictthe is a refreshingly original story about 4 guys stu alan phil and doug and their wild bachelor party in las vegas the originality of the movie comes from the fact that we do not actually see the night of partying but the day after  its a surprise that this has not been done before the plot of the story is that stu alan and phil must retrace their steps because they seem to have lost doug their best friend who is getting married the only problem is that they cant remember anything that happened the previous night after todd phillips success with old school and starsky and hutch he has become one of my favourite comedic directors and i had very high expectations of the because of phillips the extraordinary characters that were put together for this movie is what makes it so epic without phil played by bradley cooper  the handsome masochist stu played by ed helms  the responsable dentist and alan played by zach galifianakis  the insanely odd but hilarious brother in law the would not have been what it was credit must also be given to heather graham as she plays jade the happy stripper with the lost baby furthermore the addition of ken jeong as mr chow bring together a hysterical cast that will not be forgotten again the fact that this storyline has not been done before at least so well is mind blowing the wild and insane situations faced by this group of friends is laughoutloud funny the slapstick humour along with each characters original personalities make us want to watch the movie over and over again the amazing one liners that will be quoted over and over again to friends and family make us wonder about the minds that come up with such things and the musicalcameo by mike tyson is just icing on the cake so for all those who are skeptical about todd phillips and live by judd apatow i truly suggest putting that skepticism aside and watch the call up all your friends get comfortable and prepare to laugh for and hour and a half straight,comedy
not because i agree with them not at all i loved the movie i laughed so much throughout this movie it was great but there are those who hate this movie and they all say the same thing is it just me all my friends seem to think its hilarious but i barely even let out a snicker during the entire thing you can easily examine this and determine why these people think that this isnt funny these people are annoying egotistical asses who think theyre gods gift to the world the first line which they all use is it just me shows how they try to identify themselves as unique and above everyone who likes this movie yup they think that they are superior people because of which movies they like they then use the all my friends line which is laughable because these are the types of people without any friends then they say i barely let out a snicker implying that the movie wasnt just bad overall they try to make it seem as though there was no part of the movie even for say 5 seconds that was funny enough to make them laugh so to the people who say they hate this movie no one cares about what you think you selfcentred moron i hate these kinds of people luckily i havent known too many of them in my time they also usually think that they are exceptionally intelligent but their life situation which of course matches their actual intelligence is completely average and they blame it on something that they of course have no control over anyway enough with those ass holes this movie was awesome if you are one of the people i described above with a tenfoot pole up your ass then watch the movie youll control yourself and wont laugh at all to try to seem too highbrow for this movie but secretly youll love it and youll hate that you love it because you need to seem intelligent because you know that you need to seem intelligent whenever possible because in reality you arent at all if you arent one of the people i described above then watch this movie you will laugh a lot during this movie i certainly did,comedy
if you have not seen this movie yet go buy it dont even waste your time renting it you could use that 4 or 5 dollars towards the purchase i have never been so entertained in my entire life being a huge mike epps fan i was psyched to see his name in the credits and for once he didnt steal the showhe added to it most movies with him in it i find to be funny only when he is in the scenebut i cannot pinpoint just one scene stealer in this every person in this movie from the brides dad down to the guy who worked in the wedding chapel had their shining moments i will say this much ed helms is my new fave he had me at i look like a nerdy hillbilly the way his character stu dealt with his retched girlfriend melissa was just awesome too he was amazing all in all what an amazing movie people who are looking too much into this movie clearly just feel the need to complain cause they lead miserable lives if this movie didnt put a smile on your face or make you laugh out loud at least 75 of the time then you must check your pulse cause you my friend must be among the walking dead,comedy
after watching this film i thought it was one of the best comedies of not just 2009 but of the entire decade the 2000s the is about four friendsphil wenneckstu price alan garner and doug billingsbradley cooper ed helms zach galifianakis and justin bartha respectively who travel to las vegas for a bachelor party but end up staying longer as they wake up the morning after not remembering much the reason why i found this to be one of the funniest films of the decade as well as one of my favorite comedies is because of the films plot the main actors in the filmlisted above as well as some of the supporting actorsnamely ken jeong and heather graham and one or two of the cameos overallit is an hilarious ride from start to finish,comedy
judging from the trailer i thought this film would be pretty funny i was wrong it was hilarious i have never laughed so hard in a theater never heard other people laugh so hard in the theater there was almost so much laughter that i actually wished people would be quiet because i knew we were missing more jokes while waiting for the laughter from the previous joke to die downthe part with the masturbating baby was ridiculously funny and the face the baby was making was just priceless im pretty much to the point where i think zach galifianakis can do no wrong i saw his comedy central presents several years ago and was hooked i am so glad hes doing as well as he ised helms bradley cooper justin bartha and ken jeong were all great in this film i love the fact that none of these guys are superstars yet could still carry this film beautifully this just goes to show you that hollywood should be focusing on stories instead of star power,comedy
i love las vegas for an entertainment buff like me a city designed specifically to entertain its millions of tourists is my own personal heaven i never experienced vegas as the characters in the didin other words i didnt get totally hammered steal 80000 from a vicious chinese gangster kidnap mike tysons tiger lose my best friend on the eve of his wedding or marry a stripper but given what i know about the socalled sin city i wouldnt be surprised if it was possible like the city that never sleeps the never ceases to be entertaining it is funny from the setup to the conclusion and never has any of those dreaded moments when the comedy dies down the performances are spoton the humor is appropriately raunchy and the writing is witty capturing both the glamorous and lowrent sides of vegas rather perfectly the is without a doubt one of 2009s funniest and most competentlymade comedies,comedy
the intelligent comedy is a dying breed gone are the days of the marx brothers and good woody allen movies here are the days of meet the spartans farting and cameos from carmen electra its relieving than that in this current dark period of desperate cinematic comedy great movies like the are still being madethe proves that there is still genius to be derived from the unsophisticated this isnt routine slackerbromance fodder this doesnt sacrifice all its integrity for a flurry of pukeawful penis jokes it carries itself with the wit of a sitcom and the flare of the big screen resulting in the funniest mainstream comedy of the year thus far i said mainstream in the loop so dont worrytodd phillips has outdone himself this time because the is his best film to date though given his last outing was school for scoundrels that mightnt be saying much in terms of personal vigour but his latest trumps a lot of americas recent comedic outputits become a recent fad in cinema to compare almost every american comedy to the work of judd apatow a more mature but not quite as legendary kevin smith following his rise to fame his movies have conquered the hearts of cinemagoers pleasing both the box office and critics so how do comparisons with the hold up well if apatow is an auteur for finding hilarity in the mundane or deadly serious unplanned pregnancy heartbreak etc than phillips is the master for creating comic genius from the completely insanein fact the only thing thats even remotely similar to apatows frame of work is the layered character observations because whats significantly exceptional about the and that indefinable quality that made and didnt break it is that its very taken with its characters rather than constantly busy itself with an excessive drive of punchlines its very involved in the surprisingly acute development of our illustrious trios relationship and frequently reaches breakthroughs in terms of simpatico an oddball zach galifianakis alan a lothario bradley coopers phil and a neurotic ed helms stu they may be these characters are still very investible and very believable and given the ludicrous events that transpire during the movies runtime thats pretty impressivethough that doesnt mean it doesnt yield many a punchline in fact the gag rate is unfathomable and on average theres a joke every few seconds even more impressively for every joke that misfires there are two that hit home to hilarious effectbut going back to characterization it brings me nicely to the performances whats refreshing about the is its neither the first comedic outing for a major actor nor does its cast consist of the usual humdrum snl affiliates while the primary trio are seasoned its great to see some different faces appose to the norm and boy you wouldnt want this cast any other waybradley cooper as phil is cocksure charisma winningly applied to an everyman the average schmo can both like empathize with and similar to galifianakis alan somewhat idolize hes slick hes suave and hes no slouch when it comes to punchlines and thanks to his leading man good looks hes enough to bother ryan reynolds and just as talented given that hes never really given a definable moment to shine his insanity compared to his costars is admirably lowkey but sadly he is upstaged by both helms and galifianakised helms one of the most underrated and scandalously underused comedic actors to recently come about fits the role of stu perfectly which is a pleasant surprise fans of his will probably be more acquainted with the many selfserving idiotic assholes that have shaped his frame of work so far hats off to phillips for giving him the attention and limelight he deserves because it was definitely worth it watch helms throughout and youll see how his increasinglyfrustrated stu begins to squirm the characters outbursts mightnt come as quite a surprise as a result but youll still be able to watch a maverick subtly begin to take centre stage if however you dont have the tolerance to do so than simply laugh your ass off at his pianovoice solo midway through the movie and particularly his ribtickling fermataand finally zach galifianakis its not difficult to identify which aspect steals the show galifianakis as alan turns in a comedy tour du force thanks to galifianakis undivided dedication to manic vivaciousness and the innocent dumb grace he inhibits the character with alan is the unfaltering focus of a very devoted audience all of whom should be waiting for his next hilarious pratfall or observation you cant masturbate on a plane because of 911 apparently he is endlessly funny and just never wears thinunfortunately not everything is as steady theres a hammy ken jeong who after one funny moment just becomes plain irritating also the film fancies itself both a comedy and a mystery movie but the characters sleuthing grows a little monotonous as things proceed every twist is very predictable and while some scenes do offer legitimate pathos the scene in the impound lot for example others just deter from the general interest thankfully the movie is deliriously fastpaced and doesnt fret too much thereinand you yourself should not fret because theres more than enough here to entertain and enthrall three supporting players finally getting a stab at lead a wonderful high concept used to its fullest potential not to mention a great depiction of the title ailment such unprecedented delights as a taser gun demonstration with two overenthusiastic cops a winking rain man spoof with a great and wellpublicized use of the song joker  the thief and a rooftop speech from alan that had me in stitches long after the movie was over,comedy
i saw this movie in theaters twice in the first week that it came out unlike most of the rrated comedies released recently it has some sexual jokes but never gets completely raunchy everybody in this movie did a great job bradley cooper has been one of my favorite actors since i first saw him in wedding crashers with owen wilson and vince vaughn he was hilarious in the the is definitely not like judd apatow movies which should be kept far out of the reach of kids under 13 it is a movie for the whole family to enjoy and will make a great gift for anyone of any age all in all this was a pleasant surprise and i hope to be seeing it winning many awards in the near future,comedy
the takes place in las vegas when doug billings played by justin bartha and tracy garner played by sasha barrese are two days away from being married dougs friends phil wenneck played by bradley cooper stu price played by ed helms and alan garner played by zach galifianakis thought that now is the time for a bachelor party and where else better to party then vegas to their misfortune after a long night of hard partying and great times they wake up to the worst ever find the groom missing and at the same time have no recollection of what happened the night before it is now up to the three of them to find doug before his wedding just a day away with no time to waste they begin to look for clues to help steer them towards the right direction to find doug and in doing so find out piece by piece the crazy night that none of them could ever imaginei believe the was one of the funniest movies i have seen since superbad step brothers and pineapple express i laughed from beginning to end the is a must watch in theaters the character of alan garner is comical in the film he brought a unique character to life with his funny scenes bradley cooper in the movie is a teacher that would be awesome to have in real life his character is what gets the group to be so much fun by making them do all the crazy stuff with his frat boy like attitude this movie is unquestionably one of the best comedy films of the year and a must seedirector todd phillips has a unique perspective of the film he likes the way the characters portray their bad behavior and feels that this is what makes a film so funny he doesnt really have a moral or point to the film except to make it funny and something that everyone can enjoy and have a good laugh the director portrays the characters funny characteristics through their great personalities and funny punch lines i feel he does an excellent job directing and keeping the film funny throughout the entire movie,comedy
god only knows when the last time i actually laughed at a comedy film that i saw in the theater most comedy films are full of poor acting recycled garbage terrible jokes and toilet humor i mean how many times can you see the same thing over and over and over again before it gets as stale as a bag of month old potato chipswith that said the was brilliant finally a comedy film directed towards a mature audience with mature humor the characters worked extremely well together and the plot was actually interestingso many comedy films these days are so ridiculously stupid there isnt much of a plot at all just lame jokes and cardboard acting this film took it to the next level and its the first time in forever i can say i actually laughed out loud at a comedy filmoutstanding for mature audiences only,comedy
yesthis was a good comedyi didnt expect much from this moviei must say that if you liked old schoolstepbrotherswedding crasherssuperbad and other wacked out comedies you will enjoy this onei must say that just because of the storyline doesnt mean certain people cant enjoy itso what if the movie is somewhat crude and has odd things happening in itthat is comedy people and this comedy cracked me up so hard i actually wanted to see it again after it finishedthis movie had the whole theatre laughing beginning til endseriouslybradley cooper was great and so was that other guy who kind of played the airheadactually all the actors were greati have to say i like this movie for what is somewhat crudeyet hilarious a good storyline and good actors with some good chemistry make for an awesome moviebelieve if you liked old school and films like it you should see itif you need a good feel make you laugh type of movie see thiswont disappoint,comedy
this movie to me is not only the funniest movie ive seen so far in my life but also the best movie i have seen in 2009 so far todd phillips known also for directing old school delivers a smash hit that will stick in my mind for a very long timethe movie consists of many actors not very popular but they couldnt have picked better people to portray these roles bradley cooper ed helms and the hilarious zack galifianakis are the best trio in any comedy movie i can remember i have seen this movie 3 times in theaters and each time it felt like i had never seen it before because i was laughing out of my seat almost every scene if you are having a bad day watch this movie and you will laugh so hard you wont remember what a bad day is,comedy
let me just get this out of the way the is one of the funniest films i have ever seen so original hilarious and wonderful tons of oneliners and immensely quotable lines like shes got my grandmothers holocaust ring i didnt know they gave out rings at the holocaust make this movie so wonderful every scene is almost always stolen by alan garner played so well by zach galifiniakis every actor plays off each other in a seamless way this is not a real subtle smart comedy but it is so awesome that it doesnt have to be there are so many great lines and scenes in this movie that when your still laughing at one line another comes up and you laugh harder overlapping each line and making you feel so fantastic this is a wonderful hilarious and really pushforward comedy that makes you wonder if something like the 40year old virgin was really that good it still is1010,comedy
really a funny movie as it shows four friends one of them getting married name doug as they have a huge and must retrace their steps throughout the entire movie in order to see what happened and how they lost their buddy aboutbradley cooper is really coming into his own and will be a huge star he shows that even men with leading man looks can be funny and dumb but in a good kind of way you even forget that he is the jerk from the wedding crashers he will be a star if he picks the right partsed helms is the mildmannered guy you want to hug living with his abusive and rude girlfriend that you want to haul off and hit you feel bad throughout the entire picture for him as he has to live with herbut zach galdifinikas or however you spell his name is the star and one that steals the picture of the kind of laid back and comic relief in the picture with cooper and helms being the straight men to zach zachs character is rude and really messy that you want him to clean up after himself but he is really funnywarning of caution the ending when the credits go up really can be a bit naughty so be warned of that and please dont take your kids to go and see this it is naughty but in a funny kind of way nonetheless,comedy
i honestly didnt know what to expect from this movie i knew the director made old school which i saw when i was young so i didnt remember or have that to fall back on so i just went in and prayed that i was going in for a wild and fun ridepeople say you should trust your instincts or go with your gut feeling and im proud that i did this movie exceeded my expectations and engrossed me with the characters which is something i thought was only possible with apatow films having said that the comedy is very old school pun intended often relying on confusion and crazy situations instead of witty dialog which is a great change of pacei wont go into the details about the story as its fairly simple and you can just read the synopsis on the main page but i highly recommend this film now i read an article about a sequel hopefully they wont screw it up and ruin what looks like a great start here anyway when you see this movie just be prepared for huge laughs shocks mike tyson and an asians private parts enough said,comedy
hell another good 2009 movie for all my grievances about not being able to see up moon and the brothers bloom all in one week it seems like all of it is finally paying off as i found this movie very entertainingthe comedy is hit and miss but to be fair its mostly hit with my only real criticism being that the characters are kind of stock  but then again theyre still enjoyable and really fun to watch and surprisingly developed and well written in the end too the dialogue is good and the first forty five minutes or so are really good with the random suspense mixture throwing you for loop after loop until the conclusion the comedy when its really on is delightfully vulgar and silly and the pace of the movie is great sending you on a wild adventure that you wont forget any time soon full of laughsthe ending seems to drag on a bit but again nothing that really hurts the movie the isnt a modern classic but its definitely a good movie and it kept me interested recommended i really did like what they did with the ending credits that was just great set this movie apart from others and it didnt even make you wait until the ages of credits were done to see anything extra,comedy
more than once in my life i have been accused of lacking a sense of humor and lately ive been wondering if thats really the case or if american comedy has become a sad case of settling for less and just praising it more i still dont get the fascination with sacha baron cohens outrageous publicity stunts masquerading as films nor do i manage many laughs at the efforts of boxoffice juggernaut judd apatow my decision to see the was influenced by two factors the praise some casual acquaintances had given it and a genuine lack of anything else interesting playing with a sundayafternoon audience of probably 30 people i found that the american comedic filmnot to mention my sense of humorwas more than alive and well directed by todd phillips road trip the is the tale of four friends cocky elementaryschool teacher phil bradley cooper meek whipped dentist stu daily show correspondent ed helms waspy groomtobe doug justin bartha and his mentally deficient future brotherinlaw alan zack galifianakis who trek to las vegas for dougs bachelor party the night before hes set to tie the knot after a rooftop jagermeister toast that commences the nights activities we flash forward to the next morning with the friends hotel suite in disarray including a tiger holed up in the bathroom and doug nowhere to be found while trying to remember what happened the night before our trio of suddenly sober manchildren embark on a quest that is as hilarious as it is unpredictable instead of a straightforward narrative where all the comedic beats are telegraphed in advance such is the fate of most films of this sort and the story is admittedly nothing new john lucas and scott moores screenplay mines the sort of surprise and revelation that marks a good mystery thriller which the film could have easily been played for transforming each punchline into an uproarious zinger as a result one of the best films ive seen this year the is also the funniest hollywood comedy in ages,comedy
the is a compelling anomaly of a comedy one that easily could have been just another movie where a group of thirtysomething dudes get drunk and into all sorts of trouble the method in which its story is told however sets it apart from its comedic kin and makes it all the more hilarious and brillianta small group of friends pretty boy phil bradley cooper ladywhipped stu the offices andy ed helms socially inept alan awesome newcomer zach galifianakis and groomtobe doug justin bartha decide to go to las vegas for a final freeroaming bingedrinking evening away from their normal lives two days before dougs nuptials are set to take place predictably the drinking begins early upon their arrival and not surprisingly the antics begin the best departure about the however is the intelligent structure of the story from there on out the bachelors awake the next morning to discover that not only do they not remember a single thing from the night before but also that their man of the hour doug is missing and nowhere to be found it turns out that for reasons the film so elegantly reveals that the men had been drugged their hotel room is in shambles a baby is found in the closet and a tiger has set up shop in the bathroom the three friends are in similarly puzzling positions phil finds a hospital bracelet around his wrist stu is missing a front tooth and alan yet again finds it difficult to locate a pair of pantsfrom that point as the viewer youre taken on a journey throughout vegas with the films three main antagonists to determine what happened to them and their ride home doug you find out just as much as the three friends do and at the exact same time about their night out which drives up the anticipation of whatever following humorous event the friends discover the interaction and comedic chemistry between phil stu and alan is amazing the casting couldnt have been done any better the also contains cameo appearances from several unexpected characters including mike tyson and several actors who starred in 2003s old school one of director todd phillipss fantastic previous works the dialogue and language is crude and offensive yet appropriate and riproaringly funny and theres even bits of karmic plot points that round out the movie as an extremely wellaccomplished work of raucous constant humorup until this point old school only had a small handful of competitive equals but the is so confidently funny that it eclipses many of said competitors with ease even if somehow you dont begin to enjoy the movie from its opening moments youll be unable to stop being washed into the swirling miasma of curiosity and humor that the possesses chockfull of oneliners and hilarious moments the is a treat and unlike s weve all had will be one youll be more than pleased to undertake a second time,comedy

i would have never considered seeing this 2009 bromantic comedy were it not for the fact that it has been garnering such strong critical reviews my curiosity was piqued since on the surface the film represents a sophomoric genre that targets a more juvenile maleoriented audience however director todd philips old school infuses what could have been a tired premise with a noholdsbarred comedic sense which is refreshingly consistent and surprisingly human the pacing is so frenetically furious that the filmmakers give a viewer little time to question the credibility of the often ridiculous plot turns written by jon lucas and scott moore the story revolves around a typical vegas bachelor party where three close buddies get together for one last night of drink and debauchery the trio of prospective groom doug straitlaced dentist stu who is engaged to a controlling harpy and cynical schoolteacher phil is joined by the brides brother alan a bearded beerbellied and socially awkward geek who turns out to be a little too desperate to be a natural member of this fraternal clanthe newly established quartet drives from la to vegas and ends up staying in a palatial 4200anight suite at caesars palace after a rooftop jgermeister toast we flash forward to the morning after with their room completely trashed inflatable sex dolls in the hot tub a tiger in the bathroom a baby in a closet a hospital band on phils wrist and stus missing front incisor are the only clues they have to figure out what happened the night before even worse doug is missing and they have approximately 24 hours to find him for the wedding what philips does cleverly is turn his comic hijinks story into a detective story without sacrificing any of the raucous comedy in fact the subsequent plot draws broader and broader circles of implausibility with each development reinforcing the absurdist tone with sharp precision not too surprisingly as the movie provides greater clarity on what exactly happened the movie starts to lose momentum and becomes rather predictable with the inevitable climax of a highspeed scene nonetheless some of the sight gags and set pieces are unapologetically hilarious for instance a stungun demo for a classroom of grade school children a naked gangster pouncing from a car trunk and a highly inappropriate rendition of 50 cents candy shop at the wedding receptionmuch of the films success has to do with the easy rapport that the four principals have with each other the absence of a dominating comedy figure like will ferrell or steve carell actually helps this time around as phil bradley cooper hes just not that into you somehow manages to make the standard role of the cocksure alpha male into a genuinely likable character ed helms andy in the us version of the office appears to be channeling a bit of stephen colbert in bringing out stus neurotic selfprotective tendencies however most of the laughs are supplied by standup comic zach galifianakis who makes alan not only the model social outcast but also a subconscious manifestation of all the wellintentioned actions that get us in trouble justin bartha has little to do as doug as does heather graham as an obliging stripperhooker who finds herself married to stu ken jeong the cranky obstetrician in knocked up does a loopy turn as a gay gangster in a bit that goes on too long and look for a very offthewall scene with mike tyson the closing credits provide the details of the boys notorious night through a hysterical series of increasingly outrageous photos,comedy
this has nt really been a good year for comedies this year and when i saw this trailer i did nt really expect much but always open to seeing a comedy movie i went to the drive and really enjoyed myself it was really funny all the way along and even when it stopped to set up a scene it was still really interesting to watch and i never got bored throughout the movie i think most people are used to films like this right now with the shock value level set high and trying to make as many people annoyed as possible but i like to think this film has a lot more going for it with much better humour and if not that much funnier charactersthe film also uses its concept better then all the other comedies that have been released this year and the plot line does nt disappoint and the disaster theme while used in thousands of other hollywood films before this is again done really well and keeps this film interesting and livelyoverall this was a much funnier movie then i thought it was and is another movie that has really surprised me by doing the opposite of what i thought it would be like forgetting sarah marshall and i was very glad i decided to this i give this movie 83 i would recommend this for lovers of apatrow styled movies knocked up superbad zack and miri make a porno,comedy
after a long time heres a movie that brings in great fun and comedy if you love road trip euro trip sort of movies you will love this one as well this is one movie during which you cannot stop laughing kudos to the director and the cast the three guys in the movie are really cool and they did a terrific job nothing new when it comes to heather though she plays just another stripper kinda role tyson was funny but just like him in the ring the movie is just not predictable and the script is just cool thanks guys for making us laugh our stomachs out watch out for the fat guy character he is great the movie is real stress buster and ideal for a friday evening just right thing to do after that hectic week would definitely recommend one watchenjoy,comedy
the is a very funny movie with several parts in the movie that made me laugh out loud for quite a while my friends too and the whole audience also obviously really enjoyed it this movie is better than most of the new comedies ive seen in the last couple years or so the performances are good with all of the actors knowing their roles and getting really good laughs with the parts theyve been given on the down side there are a few parts where they go for too easy a joke or a joke you can see coming or where the movie drags without any laughs for a while but all things considered this is still well worth seeing if not at the movies then rent it when it comes out on dvd,comedy
i though that the trailers should be something to go by which is true but the jokes in the trailer get kinda old by the time you have seen the trailer for like the 3rd time in which mike tyson sings phil collins and punches the guy in the face and when he sees the tiger in the morning and when they get shocked by stun guns which were the main 3 bits in the story that i seemed to hate to see because i knew what was going to happen which isnt good when your seeing a comedy although there is funny bits with heather graham and how red the groom is at the end when they find him sun burnt on the roof of the casino and there of course other funny bits but i expected it to be a kind of laugh a minute comedy,comedy
i was not in a really good mood when i went to see this movie and i thought that i needed some mindless humor to cheer me up a bit to my surprise this movie turned out to be really funny and endearing at the same time i found myself actually liking everyone acting in this film the humor was more intelligent then i had expected and i found myself completely engrossed in the situations on the screen dont get me wrong it was still raunchy guy stuff but the writing and chemistry of this film are way beyond normal mass produced material but the main reason that i am writing this review is because i dont understand the people that give this movie a rating of one or two it is ok if you dont care for this type of humor but it is something else to say the movie was real bad even when the rest of the movie theater is laughing out loud throughout the whole film do you think the rest of the people in the theater are mindless freaks or are you so self absorbed that you dont realize the rest of the people are really enjoying the film anyway it is a bachelor movie about four guys that go to vegas that should give you some insight into what kind of movie it is going to be and as such it is really really funny,comedy
i came into this movie with absolutely no idea what it was about no expectations no clue who was in it i came out wanting to see it again and again and again i found this comedy a refreshing take on an old idea bachelor party i began rolling my eyes when the movie begun with the flashback of the wedding day but much to my relief the plot played out wonderfully taking me on a fastpaced funny twohour ride it didnt drag it didnt dwell it savored those funny moments and moved on props to the directori highly recommend this to everyone especially those hesitant to seeing it all my girls its not too raunchy but at the same time still is and is funny in all the right ways be prepared to fall in love with this flick ,comedy
when i went into the theatre to see this i had heard some pretty good reviews from online sources or just some friends that told me it was funny still i really didnt know if it would be the kind of movie that had a few funny scenes but nothing too special it turned out i was extremely happy with my choice to pay to see it in theatres this movie was awesomethere is plenty of those one liners you will be repeating with your friends for a long time i laughed a lot more than i usually do with comedy films the last movie that made me laugh this much was superbadwhich most of us know was a classicanyways dont waste anymore timego see this movie you wont regret it i promise,comedy
i had to admit that i was a bit skeptical about seeing this movie im not a big todd phillips fan and road trip and old school were slightly disappointing to me in the light that i thought they could be way more dirtierthis movie proved to me that todd phillips was holding back for a reason this movie contains some of the funniest comedic scenes you will ever see oncamera most notably is zach galifianakis who pretty much owned every scene in this movie with his awkwardness and witty dialogue another great newcomer is bradley cooper from wedding crashers who did a great job leading the rest of the cast im pretty sure that those two have a big career laid out for them after this moviethe movie contained so many great comedic moments and hilarity that i found it hard to keep still in theaters i noticed a few other people sitting next to me with the same problemall in all a great comedy not to be missed youll love the baby youll love the tiger and youll love mike tyson this is a youll definitely enjoy over and over810,comedy
for the first time in quite a while the expectation built by a films promotion equaled my final opinion of a film in this case i expected a romp and it is exactly what i gotthe principle actors here shine brightly there has been quite a bit of singling out of bradley cooper but all three of the principle characters phil played by the aforementioned cooper relationship oppressed dentist stu played by the office alum ed helms and eccentric soontobe brother inlaw doug played by the always spot on zach galifianakis take us on a great romp each plays off the other wonderfully and if any of them were not up to the task the film would have been the lessor for it what makes this film work when it could easily be dismissed for the way over the top scenarios that happen is that we the audience learn about the previous night of debauchery along with the guys as they learn about it or more accurately refreshed about it this makes the events a lot more fun because the audience shares in the emotions experienced with the guys the plot is simple 4 guys head to vegas for one last party to celebratemourn the upcoming marriage of one of their own but when our boys cant remember what happened when they awake the next morning not to mention cant find the groom things kick into high gearthere are supporting players sprinkled through the film like heather graham mike tyson ken jeong another scene stealing spin mike epps none of these removes you from the fun even when tyson enters the scene his presence just seems to fit and makes sense given the previous nights party be sure and watch the ending credits for photos taken during the night that shed even more light on what went downthe only complaint that could be leveled at the film is the anticlimatic ending they do a great job of teetering the line of way over the top and plausible through the film but the ending plays it safe perhaps a bit too safe the other complain is the waste of justin bartha he plays the groom to be doug his character is pretty much the straight man and is lost for most of the film with his character being lost bartha has shown great comic timing in previous supporting roles that it would have been nice to utilize his talents a bit morethis is one of those films you have to go and see again because you inevitably miss something from everyone in the theater laughing i will be seeing it again myself,comedy
the is a reckless comedy that follows the usual male bonding road trip formula but with an edge that makes it stand out from the rest of the pack of sophomoric comedies made in this veinstu his two best friends and his rather odd brother in law head for vegas to celebrate his bachelor party on the rooftop of the bellagio they drink a toast to the night ahead flash forward to the next morning where three of the four awake to a trashed suite with a tiger in the bathroom and a baby in a bedroom stu is nowhere to be found and everyones memory due to spiked drinks of the night before is a blank slate in order to find stu and get him to the church on time they must piece together the night befores ability to maintain a degree of suspense albeit comic throughout while remaining irreverently hilarious as it goes in an out of bounds of credulity and taste is what makes it a refreshing entertainment so a wedding chapel owner gets shot in the shoulder with no repercussions or the hapless trio agree to be tasered by police in a classroom who then give students a turn ridiculous yes hysterical that too its clearly a guy film with its un pc chauvinism insensitivity and actions by the eclectic band of jerks in full display of extended adolescence but womens laughter was every bit as evident as men the day i caught the show it was easy to see why,comedy
ive seen a trailer for this movie when i went to see a terminator 4 and i instantly liked ithowever i still had a doubt that this movie will turn out to be something like what happens in vegas with ashton kutcher and cameron diaz which is not a bad comedy but nothing special eitherjust an average moviei must say that im glad that my doubts did not come truethe is a great comedyone of the bestits as funny as it could beits even intelligent in some sort of weird waytod phillips has chosen a dream cast for this filmthe cast is really excellentand not only because the characters are greatwriting is excellent tootheyve managed to write a comedy that at no point is a clich and that at no point is predictable which is a great plus in my bookthe only man who managed to do that in this genre in the last couple of years is judd apatowtoo short the story this movie is greata weird and perverse fat mana fancy guya geek and a missing bachelor will make you laugh from beginning until the endgo and see this movieyou wont regret it,comedy
i went to see this title today and boy im glad i didthis movie is definitely a guy flick during this film you will turn to your buddies and say yeah i could see this being us this movie will let you leave the theater with a smile on your face for ten dollars well spent with its ups and downs to its what the moments and its constant gags that will have you laughing from the bottom of your gut this movie is a must see for the comedy thirsty movie goer in need of an oasisif your in need of a good comedy film id recommend this to anyone with a sense of humor the film does a brilliant job of a memento style chronology from beginning to end this film will keep you begging for more,comedy
this movie is a blending of friendship fun and little bit of adventure,comedy
people have given it 10 stars people have said its the funniest film theyve seen people are silly seriously though i laughed at 1 bit and that was when the naked chinese guy jumped out the boot i was expecting a lot more in terms in humour and storyline sadly i was abit dissapointed,comedy
thoroughly agreeable whirlwind comedic adventure that isnt afraid to get crass but is dignified with itit really kicks off with a mystery and then develops into a building crescendo of increasingly high stakes that is all ok in the endgreat characters,comedy
back in the day i loved this movie i tough it was fantastic and that it was an original comedy film i decided to revisit the whole trilogy and oh man what a surprise this is not goodthis was praised as being original i though that too its not i mean this is like a ripoff of a simpsons episode and the core idea of the film its totally wasted they couldve made a masterpiece but this movie lacks precision and the pace is too slowyes there are some funny things i will not deny that zach galifiandandonga does a great job in his role bradley cooper is good too for me the best one here is ken jeong that man was born to play mr chowmeh this is just meh watch this with some drunk friends thats the only way you will trully enjoy this,comedy
very funny with a cool idea for an interesting original story lots of memorable parts and funny characters and i liked how they figured it out 3 viewings,comedy
its well written the acting is spot on the premise is good the night after is somewhat familiar even though minus the baby and tiger i guess my problem with the film is something it cant help  being so totally american american humour in these kinds of comedies is always pretty extreme usually sexual in some way and a bit gross out and most of the international audience love that and thats cool its probably a boys film more than a ladies not that ladies wont be amused but boys will relate to the kinda awkward friendship circle the hazing the humour unless youre a stripper or a psycho bunny boiler gf theres not many people for ladies to relate to but hell its a film i respect the writing and the reception plus its popularity just not my kinda thing i prefer more quirky dry humour less obvious but i knew that going in,comedy
the funniest comedy of the 00s this is not and im tired of other modern comedies referencing from the producers of the as if its a work of art its watchable with a few laughs none from me thoughnothing new there that will appeal to the majority of viewers a group of friends party the night away before a wedding but as they wake up with a killer they quickly realise that they had an extremely eventful time where their friend is missing with no recollection whatsoever they must retrace their steps which often results in absurd encounters a tiger in a bathroom stealing a baby unknowingly piercing a mattress atop a rooftop statue and missing a toothwhich happens to be the most realistic outcome look im sure weve all had terrible s but none this stupidly absurd the lunacy of these situations is what supposedly creates the laughs to which i give credit for the inventive use of the flashback narrative structure but i was left feeling dumbfounded rather than joyous sometimes less is more and in this case fewer silly scenarios wouldve made the story tighter and more cohesive as opposed to just being a montage of events the dynamic friendship between cooper helms and galifianakis was thoroughly developed and conveyed with buoyancy theres banter emotion and fights enhancing how the reckless night has affected them mentally acting was charismatic from everyone except helms who i just do not like he is just so plain in everything and typically unfunny the screenplay does have some quotable dialogue often recited by many teenagers thinking it was cool to say paging doctor ft oh yeah and mike tyson has a cameo so if that hasnt tipped your glass then i dont know what will unlike most s this is rapidly entertaining with some humorous lines and committed performances but remains mostly unfunny leaving a bland beer aftertaste what i do want to know is what they were drinking because ill have what they had,comedy
you actually will have good times with this movie some of hilarious scene  i reallt love alen with those stupid things and spc cry that he had  every one wants to have thises times ghathering withe others friends and have particular time in their lives,comedy
under the direction from todd phillips the truly personifies what its really like to be a man in its assets and liabilities comedies have personified men in ways where they can be seen as overly melancholy or too crude in their demeanour but phillips like he did with old school and starsky and hutch here he knows his psychology towards the male gender without making by avoiding the traps of making them funloving vulnerable and yet sincere what makes phillips successful as a director is his sincerity even when his films dont always score high at the box office o me the is one of the funniest films of 2009 when you think about it most men behave the way that the characters in this movie are depicted they can be crude eccentric and macabre in nature especially when they are on the road together while at the same time they could be juvenile in their wild sexual urges but also nourishing once theyve settled in but the reality is hat most men especially the married ones would rather feel comfort bonding and opening up to other men over their wives to get a better understanding of what its like to be a guy and to solidify their role as an alpha male the simple plot of the is about four friends who venture off to las vegas partying off like theres no tomorrowonly to wake up hungover and blanked out about the events that happened yesterday only to find their hotel trashed an abandoned baby a bengal tiger roaming around loosely and chickens scattered all over the suite to be blunt something doesnt quite add up an early scene describes the importance of malebonding we have one of the four guys named stu ed helms a well disciplined dentist who is living with a selfabsorbed control freak girlfriend named melissa rachael harris whom he plans on marrying she finds it uncouth that hes hanging out with his friends even though she think theyre going to napa valley to indulge in wine testing in her eyes melissa believes that men are practically disobedient women who need female partner to set them on the straight and narrow but in reality stu being more levelheaded than the other guys just really wants to socailize with someone of his gender the events that proceed might turn into the worst two days of their lives while at the same its also the best two days of their lives while the welldisciplined stu hangs out with his three friends which are doug justin bartha the groomtobe whos very protective of the mercedes his fatherinlaw lent him oy vey then theres phil bradley cooper a cool customer whos not very comfortable about being domestic and then you have alan zach galifianakis dougs future brotherinlaw who steals the show as their simple friend whos there for the ride but has well intentions the opening scenes in the are funny not only in the situations these characters are facing but the dialogue is also both clever and witty phillips along with screenwriters jon lucas and scott moore call all in the humour that at times boarders on grotesque one characters serves his breakfast with a side of vomit but it fits well into the story these are just average guys who just want to have fun although they found it more complex than they could imagine because its harder to have fun when youre older than compared to when you were a teenager by the time they wake up stus front tooth was extracted phil is seen sporting a hospital bracelet around his waist and doug is mia the fun was sweet but the is the least of their problems the search for doug gives the gang a reason for staying their welcome in vegas and helps the story flow quite naturally as they come to their senses the gang start to realize how everything turned out the ay it did and will stop at nothing to correct themselves and their situations the weak areas of the film come during the last act where the comical factors get watered down but it never loses its focus or meanders off in another genre its a dark comedy that stays true to its genre many sitcoms and other comedy movies can learn a thing or two from the in its duration the crew from the took the liberties to offer the film with vulgar and tasteless jokes and scenarios and outrageously deliver plot twists that unpredictably come from out of nowhere just when they think they got everything under control they pull back which is not all that bad the is movie that never delves into anything remotely horrible but rather the horrible events they encountered that created memories that could pass on to their kids when theyre older,comedy
could the be one of the greatest comedies of all time i truly believe so a red hot film that sets out to achieve what can only be described as immortality how many young men these days fantasise about the ultimate night with the most extreme possibilities becoming a startling reality the answer is most of them what the has done is taken every element that is considered cool or awesome and thrown them together into a pot the pot of course being the film its dazzling it makes your heart race at a thousand miles per hour it makes you want to be part of the film itself bingoeach and every viewer is invested regardless of age gender or creed you cannot deny that the isnt a fine piece of film makingthe acting is sublime each of the four protagonists bring something different to the table you have the stupid and simple alan the cool and trendy phil the geeky and put upon stu and the level headed and somewhat smart doug who just so happens to be the groom the variation of character contributes to the overall success of the film their styles are different but their antics end up the same pure geniusits pop culture at its most stylish appealing to a main stream audience thats why it did so well at the box office well surpassing the general level of what comedy films average it was such a success that two sequels were commissioned making the a trilogy of films opulence and elegance take a back seat this is the modern century at its most disturbing so buckle up and be prepared for one hell of a ride,comedy
the is absolute comedy treat for little over one hour forty minutes its how four friends decide to visit las vegas just before one of them gets married i did not saw the trailer just decided to see it on the basis of imdb rating genre and introductory lines and guess what happened i was surprised by this standard entertainment it is really exceptional everyone should see iti liked how they find doug ended up with 80 grands and stu calls off his relationshipdirection screenplay cinematography action taking place in las vegas vila a tight script and city life with all the casinos and clubs it turn out welltone all the friends are wasted will they reach the marriage in time is the tone on which movie runs as their friend doug who is to get married goes missing it is all captured exceptionally wellmusic music is good however i would like to put light on like other hollywood movies entire songs are not present except for one which is screened along with end creditsacting acting was goodfinal verdict every adult must watch it,comedy
the movie is fun probably is the style of comedy that makes curiosity in this sense is the director of the film one able good at shuffling the cards because what was initially comedy becomes an adventure film  the background is centered on las vegas locations of perdition in summary of what said before on the skill of the director todd phillips is because for finding a friend is synonymous a run for obstacles plus all the outline for example a tiger in hotel bathroom a marriage without memory a chinese with thirst for blood which helps the action of the film etc anyway a film of unexpected comedy scene that does not to see again,comedy
do not expect to see anything new in the which is played for good oldfashioned bawdy belly laughs it has no real plot although is very easy to pitch possesses very little in the way of characterisation although lots of people are frequently coming and going from the frame and on top of everything else does not seem to have a single thing to say on any particular issue whatsoever we have already experienced quite a lot of what transpires here in an american pie film or some such other contemporary comedy about adults who should know better cameos by famous boxers and maybe a liberal use of various pop songs aside there is very little actually going onjustin bartha plays doug who is about to be married to tracy barrese in what promises to be a lavish californian wedding between two people very much in love in the opening scene doug and his brotherinlaw tobe alan galifianakis are sizing up their wedding day apparel doug is shaven handsome has a good build and looks smart  hes worn suits in the past and hell wear them again alan by comparison is flabby unshaven and childlike  we do not sense he has ever worn a suit in his life nor that he has ever had many friendsahead of these two men and before the wedding is a trip to the nevada city of las vegas which they are lining up with two more of dougs friends so as to provide the husbandtobe with a final night of bachelor driven fun and frolics of these two men one is bradley coopers phil whom we do not believe for one second is a teacher while the other is stuart helms whom we do believe is a dentist and might possess a nice house in a good part of town with a sensible girlfriend who espouses conservative views on gambling and prostitutiondiscounting alan who is now family and present by default we are unconvinced that each of these three men would really meet one another in life and hit it off to the extent they would entrust one another on a boozecruise to vegas the film is not especially interested in who any of these people really are or what they think just that phil is very bohemian and aggressive stu is ultradefensive due to a whitelie he has told his partner about going in the first place doug seems to be a kind of glue which keeps everything from falling apart and that alan is a little retardedonce in las vegas the night out gives way to a morning after characterised by a wrecked hotel room and a total lack of memory of what happened the major problem is that doug did not wake up in the hotel suite with them consumed with panic the three take to the daytime streets of vegas on whatever meagre clues they have as they frantically try to piece together just what it was they did last nightthe set up allows the film to drop various things on us which we might not otherwise find funny such as a police car matching their valet ticket two gangsters popping out of nowhere with baseball bats ready to do serious damage and a nude gentleman jumping out of a car boot other films would need to depict why these things are as they are and would thus lose a lot of impactthe is not without one or two genuine laughs with the very sudden homage to rain man being one of them and a very amusing scene of confusion whereby an exchange with some unruly gangsters returns the wrong doug yet the overriding item permeating throughout is the strange sense of disassociation we feel as phil alan and stuart charge around various hotspots looking for the groom while essentially trying to save their own skins from various wives and inlaws finding out do we care if they find doug or that he gets to the wedding who is anybody in this film anyway why does any of this even matter in the first place prior to their losing him care is taken to set up a series of items which exist to then later be knocked down stuarts girlfriend melissa hates las vegas and thinks hes gone to a winery the gangs mode of transportation is an antique silver mercedes lent to doug by his fiancs father while stuarts ring belonged to his grandmother who survived hitlers final solution are we surprised or even amused when any of these delicately poised things become tarnished or threatened by the chaos which begins to unfold around our leads the s director is todd phillips who wrote 2006s borat and before that directed road trip he later made due date in 2010 and the very much falls into line with that phillipsian road moviecomedyperpetual chaos aesthetic which he seems to enjoy penning and making borat was often very funny because of the outlandishness of the central character and what he had to say to real people in real situations road trip was about someone who had to learn to appreciate what he had while due date depicted somebody learning to accept those different to himthe isnt really about anything or anyone its opening montage of vegas set to the gloomy tones of bill withers followed by a shot of the four roadside and looking pretty desperate seem to set something up on the nature of vegas but by the end the consensus seems to be that its a pretty darned great place to go and that pole dancers make for better wives than conservatives once its finished we have seen a series of moderately unfunny scenes of no real order or coherence have laughed maybe twice and been offended at least once skipping this particular is advisable,comedy
waking up in their vegas hotel room with a tiger in the bathroom a baby in the cupboard and no memory of the events of the night before three men desperately try to piece together the events of the previous evening in order to locate a friend who has gone missing in this golden globe winning comedy given the importance of wild drunken shenanigans to the plot one might expect the to be a juvenile comedy full of laughs of the grossout variety however while there is some overthetop vomiting and toilet humour the vast majority of gags in the film are surprisingly well scripted the screenplay is in fact quite clever and innovative with many mysteries beyond just the baby tiger and missing friend  most of which only gradually begin to surface as the friends delve deeper and deeper into the events of the night before the shot of the friends by the side of the road before the film begins to flash back is thoughtfully done too to disguise one of the main twists towards the end not all the gags work with several telegraphed too far in advance bradley cooper mentioning that only the interior of the car is damaged and some of the characters are a little grating but the film is more amusing than most rrated movies out there a photo montage during the end credits additionally provides a pitch perfect note for the film to conclude on,comedy
the crude possibly overrated film well maybe that is true but i still liked this movie and found if funny enough to be good the whole story revolves around a bunch of friends who go to las vegas to celebrate a guy named dougs soon to be marriage and well get in a lot of trouble along the way the plot not only has people going missing but also it has in such a humorous movie actually not that bad a story kind of exciting in a certain way overall really the whole film is one continuous laugh placed over an actual story but it works somehow and even though i do feel people love this a bit too much its still more than okthe movie stars bradley cooper ed helms heather graham and also zach galifianakis who is by far far far the best character of the movie very funny and he does exactly the kind of job you would want from that kind of personality now im not saying that the cast are bad the acting is good no doubt but my only problem was that some jokes arent that funny or at least the ones given to the main cast other than galifianakis if you follow the story closely and become really engaged the only real big laughs will come from zach and although actors like ken jeong have their moments it is the man playing alan who is supremethe script is one of the other great things in this movie a fine screenplay from jon lucas and scott moore who seem to mix the right amount of crude humour with an actual plausible storykind of todd phillips directs and does a good job i never felt his vision truly was great and some attempts to get a joke across are flat nevertheless phillips continues his career in crude comedy well and i cant say his work is anything but fine one thing that i really noticed was the cinematography absolutely brilliant skyline shots mixed with some fantastic angles when trying to simulate being drunk getting into a fight etcas movies go in popular culture the trumps many a movie in the way of memorable quotes and that is pretty much all because of alan i think what makes him so memorable and also likable is not just the writing and the acting but also the direction in which phillips gives the jokes are timed so well it is impossible for phillips not to have had a hand in making them stick of everything he does in this movie this is truly the only part i feel he got truly very well done im not discrediting bradley cooper ed helms etc but it is only the comedy stems from one character and i think the laughs have to revolve around alan to make this movie funny and i think it does that just about enoughin conclusion the is maybe not the most funny comedy ever nor the smartest but it is what it is and it isnt shy about that of all the jokes the crude ones never get out of control except maybe once with the needless ones such as the one aimed at ed helms character stu right at the start other than some of those jokes the movie is pretty intelligent and the story well thought out i know at the time of this review that the second and third movie in this now franchise are very badly reviewed so maybe this is one to savour,comedy
well the story sure presents something fresh at the time this movie was released the story combines the classic element in comedy mischief and adding in the newer ingredient of the retarded friend in the character alan to offset the whole situation i must say that the comedies are really not that funny despite the movie being very much unpredictable i only find some of the jokes kick in and made laughs the ones in the police station and the ones with mike tyson are really the ones that made me laugh hard but the movie is still quite a good comedy in overall having bradley cooper act in a quite crazy of a comedy here is surely a nice touch it really adds to the acting overall which is slightly above the standard for me zach galifianakis nicely plays the retard having most of the comedies originate from ed helms balances the three main characters as the one who tries to sober the other two justin bartha nicely played out his part on the opening part that it feels like his character really is an integral part of the movie which he really isnt,comedy
for many viewers it represents one of the great comedy it is not a wrong verdict but important in its case is the courage the courage to use so many ingredients the courage to create and use a big chaos the courage to work with a special cast and that is for me the source of its impressive success  the freedom as only way to say a story in each person discover himself the result  a profound different comedy because it only seems an easy job but it is work of high precision of script and director art a film about nothing but not another seinfeld a film without taboos but  strange not vulgar a film about friendship as link between ordinaries men and few memorable scenes an old recipes in new clothes with a fresh spirit that could be all but it is not a bad idea to see it again and again for fun and for the charm of insignificant details who becomes real important,comedy
if the shit in the above sentence bothered you do not watch this movie the is an adult comedy and politically incorrect like most comedies are best until the last strand of hair so if you want a mood allowed for children look for another filmpart of being an adult humor is no demerit in any sense actually it does with that is the funniest movie of the year so far it makes you laugh from the first minute until the last and i doubt that any movie that will debut can overcome itthe film opens with phil telling the bride that her wedding will not happen the groom is missing fucked up everything he says we returned two days of this event the groom doug is departing to las vegas with his two groomsmen and his brother for his bachelor party in sin cityone of the groomsmen phil bradley cooper is a college professor married with a son who says he hates his life stu ed helms is a dentist who tells everyone who is a doctor and is completely dominated by the female vixen that betrayed at a party on a boat alan zach galifianakis is the half brother of the bride slow mentally that legally can not get too close to schools he looks like a gremlin comes up with the instruction manual  one refers to itnext day the big night they wake up with the room totally destroyed a child crying in the closet a tiger in the bathroom one missing tooth a chicken and the missing groom since we do not find it anywhere they begin to retrace your way through clues they find to make matters worse when the valet will deliver them to the car a brand new mercedeslaw of the groom delivers a police carthe search for the groom makes one visit chapel weddings overtake a chinese mobster effeminate enter the house of a prostitute make a stop at the hospital and met with mike tyson this tour for a long day for vegas looking groom causes are slowly reconstructing what happened the night before and notice i did not use the word reminiscingdirector todd philips has in his hand a film filled with bizarre characters in absurd situations of course the trip to sin city serves as a shock therapy for all characters and this is the best movie looks like his previous films awesome day and road trip were just the outline of what was to comein the end it was just a question what the hell does that chicken there,comedy
the i remember watching this when it first came out and i was the only one out of all of my friends that thought it was crapthe film is about 4 guys who go to vegas to celebrate a stag party the problem is the stag is missing and nobody can remember what went on the night before there are a lot of things wrong when they wake up the next morning the stag is missing the room they are in is wrecked the dentist is missing a tooth there is a tiger in the bathroom and they find out they have as police car their missing is to now try and retrace their steps to find out where their friend is so they can get him back in time for the weddingas i said at the beginning i have seen this before and was very disappointed but after watching it again i really liked it this time around the story is really well planned out i love the idea of the film starting when it has already all gone wrong you have no idea just like the characters what has happened and it is a great adventure what happened the night beforei loved some of the twists in the story it does just keep you laughing throughout just when you think it couldnt get worst something else comes to light and you realise it is a lot worse than expected the characters were not very likable every one of them has something about them that makes them the worst friends in the world but they do stick together and do not stop until they get their friend back the acting was really good throughout it makes a change but the casting was perfect the film stars bradley cooper ed helms zach galifianakis justin bartha heather graham and ken jeong there was even a great cameo by iron mike tyson mike cant act to save his life and he definitely cant sing but it did add to the comedy in this moviethe adventure in this film plays along so well that it is a rollercoaster ride to watch this film is very funny and if you have seen it and didnt like it watch it again i liked it a whole lot more the second time aroundi will give this 7 out of 10what do tigers dream of when they take their little tiger snooze do they dream of mauling zebras or halle berry in her catwoman suit dont you worry your pretty striped head were gonna get you back to tyson and your cozy tiger bed and then were gonna find our best friend doug and then were gonna give him a best friend hug doug doug oh doug dougie dougie doug doug but if hes been murdered by crystal meth tweakers well then were sht out of luckfor more reviews please like my facebook pagehttpswwwfacebookcompagesordinarypersonmovie reviews456572047728204refhl,comedy
the is incredibly funny and enjoyable especially for adults because it haves a lot of mature themes maybe the plot isnt terribly good still you will laugh out loud while watching the movie the characters are funny and friendlyim not going to give any spoilers but i can say that the plot is good it seems a bit predictable for some moments but its really enjoyable the story is full of comedy while it shows mature themes so i dont recommend this to children but to the old teens or adults its enjoyablevoice acting is professional for my opinion and the actors are pretty good they really captures the perfect personalities to the different actorsif you are a teen or an adult buy this movie while it doesnt shows something spectacular you will enjoy it and you will laugh even if you think for it 7510,comedy
the is a comedy that is centered on four friends doug is about to get married and the four friends head to las vegas to celebrate dougs impending marriage these friends are doug phil bradley cooper stu ed helms and alan zach galifinakis who is the future brides brother they are headed to las vegas for dougs bachelor party after a heavy druginduced night of partying phil stu and alan awake to find that doug is missing the men then run around las vegas trying to locate their friend the entire adventure is filled with chaos and action throughout the adventure they piece together their night while simultaneously running into absurd situations phi and stu also learn that alan gave them all roofies which lead to their inability to remember anything that happened the previous night although in the end all four men become friends this was not true in the beginning alan is the odd man out yet throughout the film he begins to fit in with phil and stu it is truly a movie about the bonds of friendship in the most comedic sense possible mixed with adventure and action consider the very final scene after doug gets married where they all gather around the camera to see the pictures of their mysterious night it symbolized the growth of their relationships they had overcome the most extreme of circumstances because of their bonds granted the object is more to entertain than anything else i would certainly argue that the director was not emphasizing the bonds of friendship in a way this film reminded me of old school these films are both comedies and considered cult classics in old school a group of friends came together to overcome very tough circumstances their bonds kept them together and in the end they overcame their obstaclesone motif that i spotted in the film is stus missing tooth throughout the movie every time we see stu we are reminded of the craziness and impulsiveness of this film it represents the chaos that surrounds this film it could also represent the obstacles that stu phil and alan face in their quest to locate doug i felt the soundtrack for this film was very appropriate as well much of the focus is on the action so much is going on and the film keeps moving on at a rapid pace the music helps to facilitate that mood of jampacked action it was also appropriate that alan sang a song about the three best friends that anybody could have it signified the growing friendships within the group after their disastrous bachelor party,comedy
ok for starters i am probably a bit older 53 than the demographic this film was targeting in spite of my advanced years i found that this film is the funniest slob comedy i have seen since animal house the original in the genre id rate it an 8 12 but there is no provision in the ratings block for decimals or fractions i really dont want to get into the situations the guys find themselves in as there is an answer for everything in the last 40 minutes of the movie even the most outrageous things get a plausible explanation plausible and undeniably hysterical all in all a very fun movie,comedy
the 2009 film the directed by todd phillips is a mix of comedy mystery and suspense that creates a popular cinema hit the audience experiences a combined taste of road trip and sherlock holmes it is a perfect film for not just young audiences but adults of all agesthe film takes places two days before dougs justin bartha wedding where the groom to be heads to vegas for a last bachelor night with his best friends student teacher phil bradley cooper and dentist stu ed helms also heading along is alan zach galifianakis the overweight bearded brother of the bride sasha barrese alan is a type of guy that wears purse and usually has perverted thoughts on mindthe four men check into las vegas hotel caesars palace and head out for a night in the city the four men have a drink on top of the hotel roof which ends up being the only moment they remember of the night in the morning phil stu and alan wakeup in their trashed room which includes blowup dolls a baby boy and a tiger in the washroom the worst matter at hand is that doug is missingthe guys end up recreating the evenings events by using random clues such as a wristband from the hospital and receipts from each others pockets each comical situation is not necessarily new to hollywood but the scenario and for the fact the guys are in vegas makes it seem so as the guys continue their hunt for doug they come across a stripper asian gangster and drug dealer,comedy
the hype surrounding this film was enough for me to give it a watch and while the movie itself was decent and funny the best moments of comedy come not from the film itself but from the stills of what happened during the wild night in vegasnow i wont say the film is a total let down some of the scenarios are quite funny and watching the group trying to put the events of the night back together and seeing their escapades unfold makes for some good short laughs or quick smiles but so much more could have been achieved if the film went into a different direction the simple plot device of a bachelor party weekend in vegas can provide so much fodder to work with and i am sure that a great writer could have incorporated numerous scenarios into place to make a great flick even coupling the events of the night with the escapades of the day after but instead we are kind of left sifting through the unknown aftermath and while it may come off as funny a lot of jokes dont work like they should because you dont know what led them to that particular pointit is still an enjoyable watch but it does leave a lot to be desired,comedy
how out of control can bachelor parties get this film answers that question with a big full stop i saw this film in cinemas  never commented on it the plot is that 4 guys go to vegas but on the night they forget anything that happened on that night  encounter a tiger in the bathroom someone has a missing tooth that same person getting married a stolen cop car someone missing a naked chinese man in the trunk of their original car that sounds like some weird bachelor party to me you get a lot of cameos from famous actors like mike tyson or heather graham i only give this comedy a 7 because its hard to believe they can fit all of that into 12 hours but still its enjoyable if you want a good ol laugh with your friends i showed this to my friends  they were laughing from the moment with the tiger to the pool thing with alan i wont go into details this is enjoyable as it gets for recent original comediesrating 710,comedy
ive seen this comedy twice two days in the row first with my husband and then on the new year eve with the company of friends everyone enjoyed it and laughed a lot i liked it both times the second time as much as the first and this is not usually my kind of comedies i prefer my comedy more sophisticated subtle witty but somehow won me over it started and ended fairly predictable but in the middle  the night that four friends spent conquering las vegas and throwing the bachelor party to end all bachelor parties of which they have no recollection the following morning this part of the movie was very funny just to picture once again in my mind the battle field that their posh hotel suite in the cesars palace has became with the bengal tiger occupied the bathroom and meeting every visitor with the scary roar with the lonely chicken walking on the floor and with the babyby in the closet makes me laugh again and i did not mention that one of the friends is missing his front tooth another is wearing the hospital wrist band and the groom has disappeared in the thin air did the tiger eat him or did he turn into the chicken or became a baby when mike tyson appears in the middle of the film as a visitor of three friends who were desperately looking for their friend and tried to figure out what exactly did happen last night i knew that i liked the movie showing mike tyson singing in unison with phil collins and demanding that his pettiger who was stolen from his mansion must be delivered back to him or else was a stroke of genius don luis bunuel would have loved that scene i am surewe were watching uncut full version many of the jokes were far below the waist but the performers seem amused at what they were doing on the screen and when this happens then the audience laugh not for sensitive viewers who easily blush and get insultedthe may be described in two sentences what happens in vegas stays in vegas and with the opening line from mr dolittlle song in my fair lady just get me to the church in time we all have seen many movies about bachelor parties vegas and male bonding does not tell anything new but thanks to the clever writing and the real chemistry among bradley cooper phil the schoolteacher ed helms stu the dentist and zach galiifanakis nerdy socially awkward brotherinlow to be homage to the rainman the film keeps the viewers interest and provides more than few laughs did i mention mike tyson who almost overplayed the professional actors,comedy
i cant be 100 percent sure why people think this movies is that good i mean it has funny parts definitely but as a whole i didnt think it was that funny other then zach galifianakis i didnt really find any one to be hilarious i rather hated the character of stu price played by ed helms finding him to lack in the humor department and he became quite annoying after sometime dont get me wrong this movie is funny especially the first time but upon multiple viewings it seemed to lose its touch where as some other movies that i have watched numerous times such as anchorman step brothers billy madison and hot rod just to name a few have continued to make me laugh every time i watched them in conclusion this movie is watchable is funny and is entertaining but its just not as good as people have said it to be i rate it a 6 all i have to say is kudos to zach galifianakis for being hilarious and thank you to the people who made this for putting him in it cuz without him the story line is kinda boringps thank god that the character of doug disappears in this film because he is a horrible actor thank you and good night,comedy
having never experienced a i cant say much about what it feels like but i have heard some amusing stories from friends i wasnt expecting much from this movie i thought it would be just another silly hollywood comedy loaded with nonfunny donetodeath toilet humour and very little substance however i was pleasantly surprised in a way it does remind me of dude wheres my car but with a more interesting storyline not that im putting down the aforementioned example which was funny in its own right the story itself is told well and the selection of vegas which itself is a city full of mysteries and excitements is a clever choice of course the situations are pretty extreme but that only builds the humour rather than destroy the cast that includes bradley cooper ed helms zach galifianakis justin bartha and heather graham form a solid cast i wouldnt go far enough to call it the best comedy because that would be lying but the is fun enough to watch with friends,comedy
ok let me start off by saying that im not bashing this moviethe i will admit was funny but for me it was just like very other comedy a chuckle here and there and a few scenes that are really funny this definitely isnt the funniest movie ive ever seenthe good the movie had a few good moments like when they open a door and hit the baby when mike tyson punches one of the guys or when the guy jumps out of the trunk on the guys head also had a few good lines like paging dr faggot i thought that was hilariousthe bad this movie was too hyped up that was its downfall i heard people saying it hilarious and that your laughing hard the whole time i didnt laugh hard until they hit the baby with the doorim giving it to this movie it was new fresh and kinda funny but too hyped up im giving it a 710 but i think it deserves more of a 6510,comedy
superb movie  but there will be very little enjoyment if a female was seeing this flick  in most cases furthermore guys  dont watch with your parents  it will be extremely uncomfortablethe r rating info says little as to whats actually in this film this film is seriously just a hair from a ma rating  not kidding it does say nudity  but it should be alot of nudity overall im a 24 year old guy and found this movie very enjoyable i watched it with my mom and a bunch of friends dont know why  just ran out and got this heard it was good was a bad idead l e a v e t h e p a r e n t s o u tbut older guys will definitely find this movie hilarious,comedy
some parts were funny i found myself cracking up but i think it could have been done a lot better a little farfetched and silly at times the acting was alright i dont think it flowed well and the editing left much to be desired the chicken in the room was funny but the whole thing with mike tyson was overthetop hes not funny nor that whole segment the chinese gang angle was funny the climax of the movie was terrible that should have been thought out more but then again im just a reviewer and making movies is hard and its a tough business overall i enjoyed it but i think it could have been thought out a little better it had the potential to be a classic but fell short maybe the producers were pressed for time,comedy
not bad although definitely not bradley coopers best i would say he did better in all about steve truthfully anyway it was a bit boring in the beginning of the movie and things just get better from the trip to vegas maybe it is just me not getting those jokes spilling in but i still think that this movie doesnt have the oomph i am looking for and some of it doesnt make sense like the fact that doug stayed in the roof for two or is it three days without coming back down to ask for help or look for phil stu and alan i mean it is not like hes naked or something so why stayed there for no reason and about the chow he is a good actor oh yeah i am surprised that stu and phil dont have the senses to check whether it is really the doug they are looking for before handing over the money plus jade doesnt look like a stripper at all they should find someone who looks like one,comedy
despite all the hype behind it i did not go into the with anything but mild expectations was it funny for the most part yes was it laughoutloud funny not really at least not for me the premise is quite funny itself but the jokes that follow were rather lackluster it did shine in some aspects i mean it had modestly good performances it just never really packed any kindof punch one would think from a film like this the characters dont go anywhere either only one person in the entire cast shows some growth and that was stu the dentist the others are onedimensional through and through all in all the was a decent comedy i did laugh but i never connected with the characters and some of the situations seemed rather illogical  i know i should suspend some disbelief with a film like this but i didnt believe it warranted such a thing its an okay film but forgettable,comedy
premise three guys are taking their friend all from los angeles to las vegas for a final fling two days before his wedding all goes pretty smoothly until they check into the hotel and decide that they would get a 4000 per night suite instead of the room with two beds they had booked ok maybe they can afford the extra cost but it seemed like a dumb movethe main story gets rolling the next morning when the three guys wake up in various states of dont know where doug the groom is and cant remember anything from the night before add to the confusion there is a chicken running arounda fullgrown live tiger in the bathroom and a baby in the closet eventually the tiger and the baby are explained but i dont remember the chicken being explainedso most of the middle of the movie has the three friends trying to track down the groom and the mother of the baby when they have the hotel valet get their car he comes back with a police car and hands it to them here you go officers they have no idea why they also track down that they had been to a wedding one of them got married to a stripper and they also had made a stop at the hospitaloverall it is a cute premise and a funny movie i just wish it had not been so dirty in places that isnt necessary for a wellwritten comedyspoilers as various thugs come after them they figure out that they ended up with 800000 worth a chips someone else had won they had stolen the tiger from mike tyson and a few other irregularities assisting in a taser demonstration to young kids they avoided arrest for the cop car one of the guys turned out to be an idiot savant and won 82000 for them at blackjack they eventually found doug on the roof of the hotel with a bad they got to the wedding just in time assisted by tuxes delivered on the freeway and the one guy who married the stripper decided she might be worth further consideration so they made a date for the following weekend in lv,comedy
this movie will be one to watch while recovering from a it doesnt require you to think about anything youll get a few little laughs from it and its mildly entertaining the actors do a decent job with the outlandish circumstances there is such a huge truth to it when men go away for a guys weekend they behave like adolescents on steroids had some of the preceding evenings incidents been plausible the movie would have scored higher with me as it was it was very clich and very predictable but still generated a few laughs wait for this one to come out on television and dont spend any money to watch it,comedy
now first let me get one thing straight i didnt see this film at the theatres based on its trailers it didnt look that funny and i dont usually bother seeing comedies on the big screen as i feel they come across just as well on dvd as they are not riddled with special effects etcbut i was highly recommended this film from several different people who all said it was much funnier than they had expected and that the trailers didnt do the film any justice one friend of mine even said the film was one of the funniest films they had ever seenso as soon as it was released on dvd i decided to check it out myself and make up my own decisionnow by all means the is a fairly descent comedy it has some funny scenes but that being said it wasnt that funny the laughs were there but to me they were just brief chuckles and a few little laughs i never once found myself out of breath from laughing so hard as i have in other rescent comedies such as role models and forgetting sarah marshalli know i shouldnt compare the to those films but those comedies are the ones i find hilariousi guess just felt a little predictable and the jokes were so forced in parts and obviously set up like heres a scene heres some dialogue and heres the punch lineha haplus that asian dude who played the criminal in the film just wasnt funny at all i havent seen such terrible acting since nicolas cages unintentionally comedic performance in the wickerman remakei really did try hard to enjoy this film and it is a good filmits just not great and overly original in my opiniondont believe the hype thats all,comedy
a bromance movie following in the hollywood tradition of recent years the stands at the crossroads between 2 hollywood genres  the what stays in vegas movie and the road trip movie as 4 male friends go away for a weekend of prewedding debauchery but end up losing the groom and the plot indeed director and cowriter todd phillips first feature was in fact 2000s road trip and his second was the hilarious old school and it particularly shares the latters theme of misbehaving buddies old enough to know betterthe girls are an afterthought either villains super bitches or sweet caring and perfect like heather grahams hot strippermom but the accusations of misogyny are missing the point this movies not about the girls but the friendships between the dudesif the territory is familiar the execution is not without its charms in particular the charming weirdness of alan tracys brother with his fat jesus appearance and his sweet innocent yet insane personality zach galifianakis a counterpoint to the worldly cool of bradly coopers phil and geeky dentist stu played by ed helms these 3 musketeers spend most of the movie trying to piece together what happens the night before when zachs character accidentally slipped them all a date rape drug instead of ecstasy which somehow involves a real life tiger an actual baby a missing family heirloomwedding ring belonging to stu and the mysterious disappearance of their friend and husbandtobe doug justin barthaas road movies go the is a fun ride hitting all the right notes with such fun ingredients including a cameo from an airdrumming mike tyson but the film never quite lives up to its potential and is likely to provoke laughter among the more literalminded american viewers at which it is aimed as the us reviews of this movie largely confirm for the more discerning british viewer however some goofy ingredients like a tiger a hooker with a wedding ring and date rape drugs will not compensate for the hit and miss humour of the movie and a slight shortage of wittier banter or richer characterisation for me phil isnt enough of a bastard stu isnt enough of a dork and alan could be just a touch weirder  in the directors similar former movie old school the characters played by likes of owen wilsion will ferrell and vince vaughn are just bigger and brasher making for more fun the then  like a great breakfast with some awesome ingredients after a great messy night out only slightly undercooked,comedy
when a movie is funny even though you have seen some of its funniest moments in the trailer you know you have a winner which does have some similarities to the movie very bad things but does not sport the same dark humor is a comedy that works for many reasons and was therefor successfulthe actors be it bradley cooper who deservedly gets the main active role here was a hoot when he was on alias jj abrams tv show here he can display his comedic potential more than in hes not that into you zach galifianakis is a bit odd and might scare a few people off but he is a perfect fit no pun intended ken jeong whom ive seen in several comedies in the last few months and many other comedians and a cameo here and there really make a wonderful ensemble if you can avoid it dont watch the trailer before you see the movie one cameo in particular is just so much better if you dont know whats gonna hit you  again no pun intendedthe story is pretty simple and you have to stretch your disbelief a bit but its all for the sake of really good comedy and the ending is just perfect too everything fits and even though i dont know what they really would do in a sequel there are rumors id love to see one o,comedy
did you think the scenes in the trailer were funny well theyre actually not very funny at all its all slick editing and yes as expected these are the only highlights if they can be called of the movie imdbs top 250 youve got to be kidding me remember that old tom hanks movie from 1984 called bachelor party well the writers tried to put a new spin on the concept of a crazy bachelor party as movie material but with one big difference they left out the bachelor party now this fact is not concealed in the trailers it is made very clear that this movie is about a group of buddies trying to piece together what exactly happened the previous night during their wild bachelor party from which they cant recall anything however the writers didnt really make that into a particularly funny storyso heres my spoiler during the credits you see photos that were taken during the bachelor party this is just about the only funny part of the movie and it makes glaringly clear how the movie would have been so much fun if they had simply made it about the bachelor party spoiler overmy advice is to wait until its out on comedy central there really isnt much inappropriate material to get cut out for network television anyways,comedy
i was wary of seeing this because ive really disliked todd phillips previous films which include starsky  hutch and old school i just find them tremendously poorly written and directed and yes that does matter even in a comedy timing is everything and phillips hasnt any timing the reason i did go see this movie is for one of its actors zach galifanakis one of the funniest comedians of today bonus points for ed helms who was probably the best of his generation of daily show correspondents galifanakis is one of the most oddball guys around with a lowkey style thats definitely a breath of fresh air in an industry now lead by dane cook so does he overcome phillips general horribleness yes well he does he runs away with the movie without trying the movie doesnt triumph in the end though i have to admit thats due a lot to the fact that the ads for this film have been relentless the first trailer gives away about 70 of the movies best jokes and i was watching the tonight show with conan obrien most of friday morning on hulu and the ads there filled me in on about 15 more of the jokes so yeah they gave away about 90 of the jokes in the ads and of the remaining 10 theres only maybe one gag that floored me this movie will definitely play best to those who havent heard anything about it trying to judge it objectively as if i hadnt seen all the ads id still say that a ton of jokes fall flat anyway like i said timing and phillips doesnt have any he likes to continue on for too long a lot of the time i also greatly disliked the movies lead bradley cooper i guess its not too big of a problem as galifanakas is never upstaged by him nor is helms even if he doesnt get the best material cooper is there i think to draw in women hes the kind of guy women love and men hate in short hes great looking but a total jerk the film tries to play him off as a semisensitive man when all is said and done but i never bought it,comedy
in years one of the best comedies ive seen from american soil no dumb boom bangs no dumb teenagers no dumb stars actually spoken word and this is done very well ive been to see this in theater and everybody laughed dont mind me wrong but this is almost a story for xfiles as usually if im trying to attend a movie which was described as comedy most of the people are turning their heads and dont believe how dumb you must be laugh at it so people go for it its worth trying you wont be disappointed you actually find out yourself laughing  i give it a solid 9 a big surprise for me,comedy
i as well as my wife truly enjoyed this movie and neither of us expected to in fact the entire theater broke up laughing more often than not  and at the appropriate times too one odd comment is that a family brought their son perhaps aged 3 to this one and even he laughed at several funny slapstick sort of moments this kids laughter caused others like us around him to laugh even moreas a note about kids this movie definitely earned its r rating i suppose a 3 year old isnt badly affected by this movie because all the r stuff went over his head but if you are offended by sex jokes or situations avoid this one at all costs both my wife and i were surprised at how much one can get into an r rating we thought wed stumbled into some other rating but then again i dont know what else their is eithermostly whats fun about this movie is that it has a good spirit its not mean although some of the situations the boys get themselves into can feel pretty tense if youll enjoy this movie depends if you have a sense of the absurd as well as if you feel comfortable with openly sexual situations if you say no to either of those you just cant enjoy this thoroughly modern absurdest comedy,comedy
ive always heard about this movie i decided to watch it today now all i can say that if theres leas than one star ill rated it like 0 for example,comedy
four friends go to las vegas to give one of them doug bartha a bachelor party he will never forget the next morning three of them wake up with no memory of what happened the night before and they cant find dougthis movie is a perfect example for not believing the hype when it comes to comedies the new rule is if the movie is hyped too much and it was dont go see it or leave the dvd on the shelf this new rule should become a law im working on that no good lines just the usual banter when not one of them can remember anything eventually they find clues that tells them things but not the whole story no good physical comedy either nothing was funny no one stepped forward with the kind of timing comedy demands no one oh there are some gross comments but i wouldnt call them funny or even humorous i guess they were expected to be made and here they are in las vegas one would think there would be more shots of vegas than there was total loss here at this point i am wondering if the director was one of the three and forgot he had a movie to direct sad is all i can sayi would simply call this a slice of life as would happen to you and to me nothing funny just straight up concern for what happened and where is doug that kind of slice no one even tried to be funny see also i am convinced there was a reason that the actors werent nationally known well except for jeffrey tabor but his character didnt go to vegas wait a minute i did laugh once when the three are hauled into the police station and to get out of the damage they did they made a deal and volunteered to be tasered to show school children what happens when someone is tasered kind of omgish but i have to admit to laughingnow i must issue a warning they find the camera and the camera pictures tell them all they need to know about that night when they couldnt remember what happened these pictures run during the credits and do show nudity and simulated sex again there is also nothing funny in these pictures just some are crudeafter watching many of these socalled comedies i just know i need to find my real home planet in the meantime i am going to abide by the new ruleviolence yes sex yes via the pictures at the end nudity yes via the pictures at the end language yes,comedy
from reading the reviews on imdb and looking at the ratings of many movies i now understand why it always seems a bit skewed it is because generally the critics look for certain things in a movie such as originality creativity great plotbut also decency tasteless comedies pointless action movies and gory thrasher flicks get destroyed by critics people need to appreciate a movie for what it is and have an open mind face the fact that you cannot be a critic for all types of movies unless you generally like those types of movies im not going to post a rating for gi joe because im not into military movies other than maybe full metal jacket which is in a category of its own if you dont like dirty unrealistic ridiculous rated r comedies then why are you posting a rating i would guarantee the same closeminded people that gave the a rating under a 6 probably also hated knocked up grandmas boy porkys and clerks 2 the was funny funfilled and wild from beginning to end zack galifanakias is a stand up comedian and is wellrespected if you dont think hes funny for some odd reason then give your sense a humor a sanity check ed helms is on the office he is also a real comedian and actually the office is a funny show at least most human beings i know think so if you dont think hes funny neither so be it okay  so the movie had a similar theme as dude wheres my car the concept behind the is actually a bit more interesting considering it involves a bachelor party if you think bachelor parties are lame and offensive then i seriously doubt you would like any dirty rated r comedies a vegas stripper a cardcounter a baby caught up in the mix a mattress on a roof and mike tyson ken jeong and mike epps having a whole lot of fun cracking jokes and whatnot a combination of an idiot savant alpha male and a feeble nerd is actually a lot better than ashton kutcher and sean william scott acting like boneheads the comedic brilliance behind this movie runs a lot deeper than some of these straighttothepoint predictable basic comedies like the proposal what happens in vegas and i love you man which i respect all 3 of these movies if you open your mind and truly enjoy a nice dirty comedy you might actually think its funnier than classics like airplane blazing saddles 40 yr old virgin and clerks it is up there with the best of the best i saw it twice and laughed throughout the whole movie,comedy
while the has one fun moment its quite illogical even a comedy should have some logic to it i know it made lots of money and had some critical acclaim but there are too many odd moments that dont make sense spoiler alerts a the suite after the big night the room looks like a tornado went through it or even a major earthquakebut later in the day when the guys return the suite is just as it was when they originally arrived no way could the room have been fixed up in a few short hours it would have taken days of weeks to renew it illogical b the baby how could a baby be miss placed in a cabinet for such a long time it would have suffocated the mother should have been arrested for child abuse and be put up for adoption and leaving the baby in the car for so long a time and what happened to it later in the film after its so called mother got it back illogical c the lion it was dangerous and wild when they saw it in the bathroom when the guys took the lion back to where it belongedno one noticed it incredible when in the car it clawed and damaged the inside of the car earlier then the kidnapped the lion how then did they get the tiger out of the house into the car into the lobby to the hotel without people noticing and not being clawed and mangled or harmed at all if it was wild when they discovered it how was it tame enough to get it in the room illogical d the chicken how did a chicken get into the room in the first place and what was the purpose of it other than being stupid illogical e the asian what gives here how did they get him naked and into the police trunk why did he wait a whole day before pounding and making himself known he didnt suffocate illogicalin movies of this ilk dont the writers read what they write doesnt the director or actors question these insane and bizarre circumstances and inconsistencies doesnt anyone care to make a movie that makes sense even if its just a little sense maybe its lets make an inane movie hope the young people of america fall for it and take the money and runim sure for those who loved this movie will have to agree to the above plot holesoh and performances are really bad especially the guy playing the fat dumb airhead ugh what planet did he come from an the masterbating baby was obsence,comedy
i heard from word of mouth that this was to be a must see hilarious comedy it started off really well and i give it credit for reversing the process versus the standard formulaic screenplay structure somewhere in act ii it began to get a bit flat the caricatures over characters the implausibility issues and most of all the vulgarity to me the movie deserves its place albeit as does the other 99 of comedies and romantic comedies in the bin of mediocrity and cheap gimmicks the reason for the negative review is due to the expectations i had going in i was expecting something truly remarkable it was not that im 35 and havent quite figured out this ever growing paradigm vulagarityisfunny i couldnt believe there were 5 year old kids in the theater guess ill stick to my dramas and scifi and action flicks,comedy
the centers around four friends and their attempt to understand the events of the previous night doug is getting married and he and two of his friends stu who is henpecked and phil who doesnt appreciate what he has are going to celebrate his bachelor party in las vegas alan dougs annoying soon to be step brother wants to tag along and doug says its okay much to the chagrin of stu and phil the four toast on the roof of their hotel and the next thing they know they are waking up without any idea of what happened the night before and they cant find doug stu alan and phil must figure out what happened and find doug before his wedding later that daythe plot of the is much more original and complex than most comedies the fact that they have to figure out what happened with what they find makes for an interesting almost backward telling of the story they and the audience are given the end result and both have to figure out what led up to it its also fun because you get to find out what everything means as the characters do another really amazing aspect of the was the amount of jokes they would cram into each scene whether they were funny or not every scene would just have joke after jokeall the characters are funny and interesting in their own way zach galifianakis performance as alan is one of the best break out comedy performances i have ever seen ed helms and bradley cooper also do great in both of their first big roles even the minor characters that only get a few lines manage to squeeze some comedy out of their very small roles which is another thing that sets this apart from other comediesi was somewhat disappointed in the ending however i found it to be a bit predictable and a tad too perfect rarely will a comedy have a good ending though so that isnt a big dealso in short the is not only one of the best movies of 2009 but one of the best comedies ever,comedy
if youre looking for a movie to blow off some time and steam with then you should give this is a watch if you are looking for an innovative witty film with pertinent social commentary or satirical elements this is probably not the movie for you i watched it expecting a few laughs some clichd storyline and a bit of fun and thats exactly what i got though it did feel a bit incomplete and thats probably the room that theyve left for the sequel this is a fun film if youre that sort of person but not as good as it couldve been if only theyd paid as much attention to story as they did to the gags,comedy
i dont normally go to theater to watch comedy movie but last night i somehow ended up seeing this movie at the big screen and i do not regret it at all i absolutely loved the movie because it was funny as he11 but not corny or grossly funny my wife was feeling a little skeptical going into the movie as well but we came out feeling pretty satisfied i would recommend going to theater to watch this movie because trust me it is more funny when room full of people burst into laughter all at the same time i actually do want to see this movie again i loved the last movie credit part so make sure you guys dont miss that in theater,comedy
greetings again from the darkness old school director todd phillips takes us to vegas justin bartha national treasure is getting married in a couple of days and his friends ed helms the office and bradley cooper wedding crashers decide a road trip bachelor party to sin city is a good call justins off kilter soon to be brother in law the incredible zach galifianakis joins them as wellthe next morning the three of them wake up in a trashed hotel suite with a chicken tiger and no sign of justin comedy ensues as they try to recreate the events of the previous evening through various clues  such as a stolen police car being brought up from valeted helms is very good but much of the comedy comes from zach g he has a bit of early john belushi to him thanks to the heft and delivery more importantly he is not predictable in the leastmike tyson who shows up for his tiger adds quite the offbeat element especially while singing phil collins  wow rachael harris is perfect as the bossy girlfriend to helms and their showdown near the end is a winning moment jeffrey tambor ken jeong and heather graham all have their moments but unlike the previews i wont give anything else awayif you like old school this comedy is in your wheelhouse,comedy
its nice to thoroughly enjoy a comedy this decade without catching a single whiff of apatow the fact that audiences are eating up the boundarycrossing humor of the this summer and the famous producer of knocked up and superbad nor any of his cronies seth rogen paul rudd jonah hill etc dont have so much as a finger print on it might be over half the reason for its praisestarring rising leading man bradley cooper wedding crashers yes man ed helms the office and standup comic zach galifianakis the doesnt boast the stylings of any comedic actors that weve already been beaten to death with by hollywood in the last ten years and theyre all extremely talented their characters are incredibly welldeveloped and free of too much stereotype their comedic timing excellent and the concept theyre thrown into so perfect you cant believe it hasnt been done beforetwo days before their friend dougs justin bartha of national treasure wedding the aforementioned characters head out for a night in las vegas as do many a bachelor party but the doesnt show their night out instead it takes us straight to the next morning where they wake up to find strange animals in their room one is missing a tooth and the groomtobe is missing and of course they dont remember a thingtodd phillips director of old school another comedy that for its time brought us new comedians and situations keeps the timing and revealing funny moments at a healthy pace every time we think it doesnt get funnier or more ridiculous it does the writing team of jon lucas and scott moore who delivered last winters notable flop four christmases really hit it big here having character retrace their footsteps and discover their debauchery of the previous night rather than showing it gives the trend toward rrated comedy a new set of wheels the gags here are nothing all that foreign to us but with an unfamiliar cast of talented actors it feels pretty new everything is just revitalized given new life because the script really fits the charactersi didnt particularly like cooper previously but he gets more of a chance to exercise his range with a character thats not stale helms can truly be a foulmouthed funny kind of guy but his nerdy girlfriendwhipped character stu is perfect because it forces him to hold back therefore making the moments he explodes funnier and more believable galifianakis is something else hes the new funny weve been looking for alan is a horribly dumb outrageously gutsy but sweet character with a childs heart galifianakis plays a wide range of comedy perfectly whether needing to hold back and be dumb and cute or go all out physicallythere are some gaping holes in the like the fact that they are apparently hung over but do not eat or drink the entire film also only helms character gets a true subplot   everyone else is just there to make us laugh this isnt one of those comedies with heart instead we learn to love the characters because theyre funny and we empathize with their ingeniously funny situation quickly still some of the most original comedy ive seen in years and dont forget the best and most boundarypushing credits sequence ever no question now that this is the era of dirty comedy and the delivers some of its finest,comedy
funny and at times over the top especially those jokes involving the baby its defiantly worth seeing in the theater i had a number of good laughs and with the audience response it was a little better dont expect reality here  its one long skit of sight gags but thats what its intended to be if you can suspend your disbelief and you will need to to get past the obviously unrealistic events get past the fact that theres really not much of a plot some stereotypical garbage and just enjoy the laughs youll like this movie i thought the acting was sufficient one warning its definitely not for kids,comedy
yes the f word was thrown out every 5 seconds and in my opinion a few of the end credit pics were not necessary but overallthis film might just be the funniest comedy ive ever seen let me warn you this kind of humor is an acquired taste its crude obscene and completely stupid if you arent a fan of will ferrell theres a good chance you wont appreciate this movie however for me it went far beyond my expectationsyou will laugh at lines you will laugh at situations you will laugh at wtf moments as a 17 year old i wouldnt recommend it to the younger ages but id go out on a limb and say most 17 would enjoy this moviebasically im just trying to fill up my 10 lines herebut go see this movie you wont be disappointed at all i still laugh thinking about it,comedy
this is incredibly funny  it is hilarious that is all im going to say just watch it  what annoys me is why someone who doesnt like a film gives it a 1 just to try and bring the rating down because they didnt like it groans just imagine if ice skating judges did that  for example well there you go my brother in law and i couldnt stop laughing at the film especially something they show you at the end everyone i know thought this was indeed brillianti have smart and witty friends and that includes my brother in law  i read some reviews where people say it is not original mheh  critics and historians say everything has been done before but like a great joke retold or the reenvisioning of a great idea a film like this will stay with you long afterwards and depending on how crazy or wild you r life gets occasionally you might find yourself emphatically looking back at what those poor guys went though well i know i didnt really review the film i just felt like a rant and to tell you to go see it and to balance out the 1s out there enjoy,comedy
clearly lots of people enjoyed this movie and even found it funny so i certainly dont intend to insult what appears to be the majority by suggesting that they dont know what they are talking about taste and humour are very personnel so please read this review as one mans opinionthe humour on display here strikes no cultural accord with me yet is clearly popular in the us which leads me to assume that this is idiosyncratically american humour or should that be humor though i mean no disrespect in drawing this conclusion to me it was unsubtle and based almost entirely on putdowns and pratfalls  it was not sympathetic or comfortable one would definitely have to laugh at someone there was never that warm inclusive moment when one felt included in a instant of shared humouras one would expect from the title the story as a whole was very predictable this film was always going to rely on the setup and delivery with the punch line being less relevant but not unimportant since this is where the the audience would expect to find satisfaction the themes plot and subplots need resolution and vindication at this point and the extent to which this gives closure and satisfaction to the viewer is ultimately what helps to inform our overall impression the idea of this movie is fairly well used but still has plenty of life left in it we start with a seemingly impossible and certainly implausible scenario and then unwind the story to show how it came about finally winding it on to the point at which all the issues are resolved ideally we should find as the story unfolds relationships and preexisting problems are also solved and resolved as the characters we come to love grow as a result of their trials and vicissitudes unfortunately i didnt like any of the characters and at best i could only claim to have come to tolerate some of them by the end of the movie to this extend there seems to be something of a groundswell agreeing with me from my perusal of other commentsthe setup when it finally happened  it would have been so much better as the opening scene  was reasonably inventive and certainly had scope but we had already met the characters by this stage  opinions were formed i can not believe i am alone in finding the juxtaposition of the alan garner character and the baby as anything other than uncomfortable for me as for every parent i would assume the idea of a baby with a character that has told us he is banned from going near schools is completely drained of humourfrom here on the film proceeded as a succession of vignettes and comedy sketches with the main characters taking a level of damage that would have finished wile e coyote yet carrying on little scathed there were uncomfortable moments but there were no moments of tension it wasnt that one did not care what happened to these people though i didnt much it was more a case that the comedy seemed to imply the characters were indestructible in a cartoonlike way and therefore not requiring of our care or sympathy which leads to the denouement the punchline which for me was sloppy and hurried it was more a madcap ticking off of items on a list than a careful and satisfying final weaving of the various story threads into a triumphal and complete endingthis is definitely for those who enjoy sightgags and humour that tends to the slapstick end of the comedy spectrum those looking for dry humour oneliners satire pastiche or the more cerebral styles will not be so well catered fori cannot pronounce against what is clearly not my cup of tea but by defining what did not work for me i would hope to help others whos tastes might be more conformant with mine own,comedy
i just had to comment because i think people are a little out of hand on this movie i am a big fan of comedies and usually make it to most of the big ones in theaters i heard a lot of hype before going to see it left the movie with a smile on my face but my sides and cheeks didnt hurt thats how you can tell if a movie is really funny comparing it to recent comedies to come out i would rate it below the likes of tropic thunder pinapple express borat superbad 40 year old virgin it was probably on par with step brothers forgetting sarah marshall knocked up also overrated etc it was a solid good funny movie but has no business being on the top 250 list and being one of the top comedies of all time according to the list there were laughs but i never found myself sucking for air or bending over cause my sides hurt which i did for the previously mentioned movies 610,comedy
in recent years judd appatow has become a major influence on comedy films his rrated films that he directs and produces are what seems to be in style comedy moviewise despite appatows popularity his films all seem to have one major flaw and thats his characters seth rogen has yet to play a likable character and never in any recent rrated comedies do we actually get the consistent feeling that people care for each other the along with being a dirty comedy also contains likable characters and heart its a refreshing addition to recent rrated comedy filmsphil bradley cooper and stu ed helms are friends going to vegas for their friend dougs justin bartha bachelor party also going along is dougs odd soon to be brother in law alan zach galifianakis after a wild night the guys have forgotten what happened the night before and doug is missing they have to follow various clues to figure out how they got to where they were where doug is and various other amusing plot pointsits hard to label this film its not really a sexcomedy as theres not any overabundance of sex its not a drug comedy because these guys arent drug addicts and the night before it not entirely their fault its more of just a comedy about 4guys that happens to be rated r because of its foul language and occasional nudity its nice to have an r rated comedy not out here to push the limits of the rrating really this is like the buddy comedy family film of rated r motion picturesthe actors are great and have a lot of chemistry together zack galifianakis as alan is really the one who brings most of the laughs with his performance as a complete moron whos out of touch with reality but completely likable these guys may be profane and goofy but theyre still normal guysagain something seth rogen doesnt like to perform as he always has to be angrythere are a few problems in the film its got some spots that are missing laughs and mike tyson is quite a bad actor but aside from those its actually a well done buddy comedy and mystery the box office has been gracious to this film as well it should have been and hopefully this rrated comedy will show other producers of rrated comedies that comedies can still be successful even if the characters are likable amazing but truemy rating  out of  100 mins r for some sex jokes full frontal nudity language and some drug use,comedy
i didnt know they gave out rings at the holocaust alan zach galifianakisif you want more antipc humor the gives it gay asian thugs old man without underwear shrill girlfriend lovable whore and holocaust joke see above this boyswillbe boys comedy thriller has enough raunch and racism to garner a near nc17 stay for the credits and enough crude laughs to make a few hundred milthe weekend in vegas for three groomsmen and a groom before the wedding turns into a lost one for the revelers who cant remember what happened because a lowrent dealer gave them a daterape drug rather than cocaine the result is the chaos only a fianc could dream of lost tooth child and tiger marriage to a hooker 80 k of debt and some very perturbed waiting women at home the premise of their retracing the evening is a good one providing a flashback with a detective edge throughout the dialogue does not hold up to judd apitow standards and the payoffs for the setups are weak the film is humor underdressed for a wedding,comedy
weve all been there there have been nights where weve drank too much and cant remember everything for phil bradley cooper stu ed helms and alan zach galfianakis this happens on the bachelor party for their friend doug justin bartha unfortunately the morning after they realize that they lost dougthe humor in the comes from the bizarre situations that the characters find themselves in or more specifically that they got themselves into the night before and are just now remembering it this type of humor can work although a film that completely relies on it like this one runs the risk of making the material get dry and tired fortunately director todd philips keeps things brief enough and the pace quick enough that this doesnt really become a problemits hard to address the acting because the actors play very familiar types this is the films biggest problem bradley cooper is no stranger to playing a jerk he got his big break in wedding crashers although hes more sympathetic here ed helms while not being a stranger to comedy is not a well known name hes the worrywart who turns into a doormat whenever his overbearing girlfriend is mentioned zach galifianakis is the black sheep of the group whos only along because hes going to be dougs brotherinlaw nevertheless the comedy works because all of the principal cast members have a sizable amount of comic aptitudenot everything works the movie feels underdevelopedwith a little more care it could have been a masterpiece but most of it does and there are some very big laughs to be found throughout the 100 minute running time the end credits alone are worth the price of a few admission ticketsthe is comedy pure and simple nothing is understated and its not quirky its just plain funny,comedy
hilarious storyline  great cast  amazingly written the funniest movie in recent memorythis is not your average summer comedy this is what i call the perfect medium of low and high comedy with the exception to zach galifianakis the cast is not full of colorful characters and hilarious antics but rather letting the mysterious wonders that las vegas has to offer unfold for these gentlemen this genuine work of art has some much of the high comedy that many of todays comedys are missing putting ordinary people in extraordinary situations but also including the guilty pleasure that we all enjoy the low comedy especially zachs hilarious performance and dialog actually i am a firm believer that this film will be a jump start for galifianakiss long career aheadthis wont be one that will be forgotten anytime soon you will find yourself going right back to the theater to watch it again cant wait for the 2,comedy
dude show us the money shots lots of talk about the crazy events and little show but a series of pictures during credits at end i was hyped to see this movie not bad but what it could have been shame shame lost op on this one could have been a classic would have really enjoyed seeing how they stole the cop car didnt have to be an elaborate chase scene with 10 cars following close behind like a tony scott or michael mann picture just something for us to latch onto thats all also would have enjoyed seeing why and how they were so crazy at the wedding chapel what went down so unusual that the proprietor is totally beside himself of the nights before events what did the guy with no tooth do that made the guy consider him the craziest mfhe had ever met a 10 to 20 second outrageous clip would have sufficed but no we were denied that also and why not show us a flashback of how they were kids and how they did that sleeping bag trick on their friend why not spend a half a day and get a couple of kid actors and do that for us why all the talk about last night and not show us,comedy
the writers failed to tap into all the talent and potential of a starstudded cast leaving viewers at the end wondering is that it too many dumb gags that could have been hilarious ended only being dumb or duh what should have been the high point of the movie ken jeong ended up only being a halfdimensional stereotypical portrayal of a gangster speaking poorly written lines in broken asianaccented english scene after scene appeared to be adlibbed or improvised by the actors and writers who had run out of storyline and clever ideas before the movie even started the movies only funny scene the taser was cruelishly humorous which the movie desperately needed about 100 more minutes of the baby and the babys mom and the convertible were the only likeable characters in the whole movie surprisingly the movie up until the credits was clean and not excessively vulgar,comedy
well done comedic piece with outstanding portrayals by zach galifianakis and bradley cooper,comedy
elsewhere on the web i have seen comment saying that people in the usa find the film funnier than uk folk there seems to be the suggestion that there is a completely different sense of humour between the countries i do not think this is right i am from the uk and i think there is fabulous comedy from the usa great usa comedies from over the years easily spring to mind some like it hot harvey nelson dynamite brother where art thou and on and on when it comes to tv series seinfeld for example is fantastic i loved the episode about the english patient in which elaine voiced precisely what i felt about the film in the funniest waybut the neither made me laugh nor smile i saw no funny wit and no funny slapstick incidentally i watched a few episodes of friends recently and noted that there is some terrific slapstick there that i had not picked up on before often involving ross,comedy
i did not laugh much watching this movie the very few women in this script are presented as either shrews or whores heather graham what was your agent thinking when he booked you into this trash and the men are hardly better treated being all nincompoops andor drunkards raunch and vacuity combined with bad writing and an abject storyline yes 14 yearsold and frat boys of all stripes rejoice i am not 14 years old and offensive or demeaning material dont make me laugh no i could find not one hint of redeeming value to this rancid piece of entertainment for genuine and lasting laughs may i suggest groundhog day a night at the opera swingers bread and chocolate some like it hot la story or well anything but the really,comedy
many people over the years have told me to watch a movie called the when i saw the poster for the first time in 2009 i thought it looked kind of dumb and didnt really pay attention to it which is a damn shamei really enjoyed this movie it has some very good comedy and the story itself is very interesting i was laughing all the way from beginning to endlets start with the characters the three main leads are great each one of them was completely different and hilarious you get that cozy feeling of belonging to the group that you get when watching tv sitcomsthe things that happen are way over the top but in a good way i never expected all of those things to happen the story is also very interesting you want to know what happened as much as the characters in the film it is actually a very clever idea for a comedyi would also like to praise the very good soundtrack and camera work that reveals things to us in such a good way the script is pretty great too i loved how little exposition there was and we still understood a lot of thingsin the end the is just one of those movies that will keep you entertained throughout the whole runtime and you will really rememberdont watch the second and third one though those really suck,comedy
its not very often these days that a comedy film comes along that is a genuinely hilarious and b like no other comedy movie that has come before it but thats exactly what we got in 2009 when the first movie was released this is a hilarious film all round from the plot to the script and characters  whoever was behind the casting for this film got it absolutely spot onpart of the reason why this film is so funny is that it doesnt even take itself seriously the plot is so ridiculous and its almost like they were trying to cram as many stupid scenes into the film as possible the is an example of how a comedy movie should be done aim to make people laugh and the rest will take care of itself its now been 8 years since the was released and i still cant recall a comedy film ive laughed at more since,comedy

i watched it a bit late but boy it was great it was like taking ecstasy its so hilarious my drink almost came out of my noseremember this is no 12 year old writing a first time review i am a grown man zach galifianakis is so funny in every scene the comedic timing adds an extra oomph i dont know what made it stand out of all other movies but this is funnythe way each character is portrayed one is a overcaring friend with a missing tooth and other is a chillout school teacher and then theres the retard i love the retardthis movie shows how much of the things you are missing out man i love it a must watch comedy movie,comedy
the was a big surprise in 2009  the cast is very good and the performances are great  the characters alan  stu and phil are very funny  the character alan is great  besides being very funny he is naive and big kid doug is a key to this film  the film is very funny it has moments excellent  an example is the tiger  or when the chow appears  the films plot is simple  the more it remains interesting  the 20 minutes of the film are more to introduce the characters  the direction of todd phillips is very good and the soundtrack is great  most of the songs are taken from famous bands  the is one of the best comedies of recent years with very funny moments  note 84,comedy
is a great comedy for a number of reasonsfirstly its story is original but understandable at the same time four friends have a bachelor party in las vegas and the next morning have no idea what happen how and why a simple storyin a comedy is great because you can add on it whatever you like and it will still worksecondary the majority of the characters that our protagonists meet are either likable or hilariously over the top third and last the jokes are at times quit cruel and when someone react in that crazy situation he or she starts cursing which is logical if you think what has happen and in the duration of a single night to be more analytical the last part is were the rrated comes and gives the felling of realism be honest here even the most calm person you know found himself lets be real girls s are boring in such a situation he would in hulk mud for a long time in a sense is masculine comedy with the proper humourthe only problem that this movie has is its sequel those movies which should not exist at the first placeoverload this open and shot case with out any good reason apart from the studio make more money in other words the usual weakness of the comedy and horror genres after a great movie came out unnecessary sequels and bad imitators in the end i really like this movie and if you are a man  it should be in your favorites comedies,comedy
this 2009 comedy is actually a rather enjoyable one and better yet is the fact that it is a movie that can be watched numerous times as it keeps being funny but of course with an impressive comedy cast as it has then it is a sure given that it would be enjoyablethe story in the briefly summarized is about a group of friends who travel to las vegas in order to have a bachelor party for their friend doug who is about to be married and as the saying goes what happens in vegas stays in vegas comes to a test the men are in for time in las vegas that they will never forget if only they can remember itwhat works for the aside from the storyline and the countless hilarious moments and scenes is the impressive cast list which includes names such as bradley cooper ed helms and zach galifianakis these three guys are hilarious together on the screen and they brought so much to the screen with their individual roles and characters i think that having ken jeong in the movie was just great because he is hilarious and really spiced up the movie tremendouslythe movie is nicely paced and never really slows down once it hits the high gear so strap yourself in and get ready for a hilarious ride through las vegasi was more than genuinely entertained by the and i was laughing a lot throughout the course of the entire movie i have watched it three times already and the movie continues to be entertaining and as funny as the first time youve seen itif you enjoy comedies then the is a good choice because it really is funny and if you havent seen it already i can warmly recommend that you take about 100 minutes to sit down and watch it,comedy

loved it its the best film ive seen funnynot too horny great actingsome real life situations the most i have liked about the film is its idea  they party so hard they do some messed up stuff and they have to take the consequences favorite part when they take the baby and name it carlos such a good name but its fcked up to have a stripteaser as a mother  my opinion thought so yea i think its a really good movie and i would rank the saga exactly like the numbers 1 is the best 2 is the second and 3 is the 3rd so yea i dont really know what to say since i dont have anything else to write about this film and imdb wont let me but 10 lines or less,comedy
the film features four friends and is about a stag night gone very bad in the city of vegas the comedy is strictly a r rated comedy they get drunk and wake up next morning in their hotel room to find the groomdoug missing theres a chicken wandering around a baby in the cupboard and a tiger in the bathroom the entire hotel room is in a disarray and they simply cant remember anything that happened to him last night with time passing by they slowly come to know about the adventures they had last night including a showdown with mike tyson meanwhile a mafia gang orders them to give them money in return of their missing friend the gang leader chowken jeong delivers one of the best comic performances the final show is a race with time as the 4 friends just manage to reach in time for dougs marriage all of the 4 characters has a story to tell regarding their situation in their personal life for example stu the dentist is ruled by his bitchy girlfriend and he wants to let go of her alanzach delivers a breakthrough performance and carries the film on his shoulders the film is a laugh riot with a lot of vulgarity and it deserves every letter of its r rating the sequences that happened in the night leading to dougs absence are hilarious and something not to be missed go watch the film its a gem of a comedy,comedy
here it isone of the ultimate lad films aroundwhat makes this film so amazing well picture thisyou and your friends go out for a few drinks next thing you remember your waking up in different places not in your bed and end up looking for your friends whilst piecing together the previous night sounds familiar rightwell the exemplifies that as alan stu phil  doug have a night out in vegas for dougs bachelor party after having an epic hotel room and toasting to their night they suddenly all wake up in different places and have to piece together their night to find doug before his wifetobe finds outthe acting is superb in thisi expected it from cooper but this film made galifianakis  jeong famous for their hilarious roles as alan and mr chow respectivelythe humour is constant throughout with great direction and cinematography everyone who has ever had onetoomany drinks on a boys night out with their best friends can relate to this film and the relating problems that ensue with alcoholinduced amnesia personally i found myself relating a lot to the character in these kinds of films that always wakes up first then has to see where his friends are as alcohol does not allow me a peaceful sleep,comedy
the 2009 dir todd phillips  cast bradley cooper ed helms zach galifianakis justin bartha heather graham the dawn of devious excitement for a bachelor party gone wrong four friends travel to las vegas only to wake up with a tiger in the washroom a baby in the closet and the groom completely misplaced they search frantically for answers leading to extremely hilarious encounters and plot turns one of the best comedies of the year with a screenplay with endless hilarity in the exaggeration of alcohol intake directed by todd phillips who previously made such comedies as starsky and hutch school for scoundrels and old school but this is his masterwork particularly during the closing credits when a digital camera fills in all answers bradley cooper plays a school teacher and ladies man ed helms is involved in a controlled relationship until this trip leaves him suddenly married and with one less tooth zach galifianakis steals every scene he is in with his ignorance to good fashion and an inability to say or do the correct thing justin bartha plays the misplaced groom full of promise of the glories ahead heather graham is a gem as a stripper whom helms learns that he married during the nights events they are in way over their heads as innocent fun becomes a road trip of consequences led on by drugs alcohol and absolutely no recollection of any of it score 10  10,comedy
the is a raunchy ridiculously overthetop yet consistently amusing 2009 comedy that isnt concerned with political correctness logic continuity originality or realism but still delivers the laughs i am classifying in it my just put your brain in check and enjoy filethe story bears more than a passing resemblance to a 2000 comedy called dude wheres my car though it takes the premise of that film to a more detailoriented level this film is the story of doug justin bartha a guy getting married in a couple of days who takes off to vegas for a bachelor party with his friends phil bradley cooper a married schoolteacher and dad and stu ed helms a dentist you can serve on pie he is so whipped by his girlfriend rachael harris and alan zach galifianakis an insecure and neurotic mess who has trouble keeping his pants on and is also dougs soon to be brotherinlawthe story then cleverly skips over the party itself and as we enter the guys hotel suite the next morning we see stu and phil passed out on the floor with a chicken crawling over stus head a woman sneaking out of the room a tiger in the bathroom and doug is nowhere to be found the guys than wake up and actually find a baby in a cabinet as the guys venture out to find doug further investigation reveals that the guys stole a cop car that stu married a hooker heather graham and that the tiger belongs to former heavyweight champ mike tysonthough i think i may have already revealed too much i still think there are plenty of raunchy and unexpected laughs found along the way here director todd phillips somehow manages to keep a tight rein on jon lucas and scott moores screenplay which really cant stand a lot of scrutinythe cast serves the story well with standout work from galifianakis and helms and phillips keeps things moving at a nice pace so that you dont find yourself looking at your watch make sure you stay tuned through the closing credits looking forward to the sequel,comedy
i had just watched the today i had heard that the film is awesome and when i saw it i was totally shocked by seeing its comic sequences and also all the actors have done their job over beautifullyplus the director mrphillips has also done wellthe three of the characters were good at there places and also i will appreciate its story and concept of road tripand also the supporting actors were goodi am happy by seeing this movie and i also hope if its gets a sequel it would be much better because now i had a great expectations from this movie and i will be happy if it get the franchisekudos to all the film team and wish they will work same in the future like they did in this film,comedy
with this franchise being a trilogy it has been a mixed bag however i am seeing it for the first time and it is a fantastic start this film sees 3 friends throwing their friend a bachelor party in las vegas until they lose him the next day and have to find him to get him back to his wedding in time bradley cooper ed helms and zach galifianakis are all fantastic in the film and their chemistry together is insane and really carries this film into the legendary status it has become the rest of the cast does a really good job as well with the meetings with these characters being really enjoyable and helping fuel the adventure the story is good for the idea and the concept of the but it does have the problem that a lot of the scenes are just random and dont affect the story and this is really the only negative of the film the script is fantastic with the dialogue between the characters being great and helping the films overall quality i love the idea of the style of las vegas and this film encapsulates it well also this film knew exactly what it is and didnt try to go too far overall this film is fantastic and really is one of the best comedies has to offer,comedy
this was a very smart gross dark hilarious film that had me in tears throughout the film even tho this subject has been done to death it was not done to this level of enjoyment i havent enjoyed a vegas bachelor party film this much because i normally dont like them my wife enjoyed this film as much as i did and she said how rare it is to see a film that is funny from the start to the end my expectations were really high after all that hype this film had and it didnt disappoint methis movie will never be not funny and i will watch it whenever it is on tv i just love the movie the actors the story the music just everything really,comedy
the genre of this film is comedy and it hits the nail on the head it is typical comedy but it also raised the bar on future comedies the storyline of this film was classic the film starts out with a distressed bride getting a phone call that her soon to be husband doug is missing the film then backtracks to two days before the phone call we now see the groom and realize that he and his friends phil stu and alan are preparing to head to las vegas for his bachelor party when the four friends get to vegas they check into their hotel and toast to a great night the film then progresses to the next morning when phil stu and alan realize that they cannot remember anything from the night before and doug is missing the next day and half consists of the three friends finding out clues as to what they did that night and trying to find the doug they go on wild adventures to find doug but on the morning of the wedding phil calls the bride to tell her that they cannot find the groom while he is on the phone stu finally figures out where doug is and takes the phone from phil and tells the bride they are on there way they make it to the wedding and the groom and bride are finally married at the end of the film a camera is found from the night the four friends cannot remember so they go through the photos one time and then delete all the evidence of the crazy wild night they had in vegasthe editing of the film was appropriate fade in fade out was used for many of the scenes to get the affect that time was passing for example when the four friends toast to a great night the scene fades to the next morning so we know we will not actually see what happened during the night there were also a couple of establishing shots for example when the friends first enter las vegas we see a shot of the whole city and when the friends are rushing to get back to get the wedding we see full view of the desert to see just how far they have to go continuity editing was the major editing of the film though majority flowed together and the transitions were smooth and appropriatethe cinematography supported the mood of the film panning was used quite a lot mainly when the friends were planning on what to do next which is through most of the film a steadicam was also used so the actors looked as if they were walking towards us it made us feel involved in the film closeups and medium close ups were the main angles used throughout the film all these shots supported the mood because it made the audience feel as though we were apart of the crazy night and trying to figure out what exactly happenedthe sound was very effective majority of the film used a soundtrack the soundtrack was mainly party songs so that we got the feel that it was a wild night and the friends had the time of their lives when music wasnt playing actual sound was used it was a balanced blend the score made me want to gather my friends and party so we could have an epic nightthe film was meant to be funny and show the viewers that crazy wild nights always seem to happen vegas it also gives the impression that if you want to have fun nights like the one depicted you should head to vegas with your best friends i also have biases towards vegas because i have been there several times with my own friends although we did not have nights to the extent of the we had nights that we will never forget overall this film was quite enjoyable because it will have you laughing the whole time and i would recommend the movie to anyone who asked about they are sure to be in for a lot of laughs,comedy
this film starts off with bang as you are all ready sucked into the madness that is the you have a mike tyson in this film you have tigers you have some chineses guy randomly jumping out of cars beating people up and one of them saying stop i hate godzilla too he destroys cites he kills people and you have action roll that up together you get the one of the funnest movies they find the groom on top of the hotel for two rooting hot days with no protection one of get married during the and ends up with a baby and they have to bring back a tiger to mike tyson and have to defeat chinese mod stars all before the wedding,comedy
i do not take these kinds of films seriously but a lot of people do when i took my kids to see this the movie theater was full everybody laughed i had a few laughs too i have to admit if you want to make a lot of money you make a film like this i looked at how much money this film made outstanding amount of money plot is not serious and it was not meant to be it is a fluffy comedy that is for sure i will not waste time on it typical fluffy comedy plot las vegas and allacting is rather good except mike thyson i guess they had to put him in the film or he would beat them and end up in jail we call that in europe buying social peace give him money and he will be peaceful other actors really triedthis is a film for you to take your family to and have fun please when you walk out of the cinema forget it,comedy
this movie is hilariousi dont think much more needs to be said about this movie other than just repeating that the is a really hilarious movie experience to enjoywatch it with friends and you will laugh non stop i guarantee you will its so funnyif i try to get specific about any of the plot it will just ruin the fun for you because so much of this movie is about the surprises that pop up and the unraveling of the mystery of where these guys lost their friend while they were drunkzach galifianakis is incredibly funny in this and every joke in the movie is greatnot the best movie ever but for pure laugh value it is a really hilarious movie,comedy
i had only the vaguest impression of this movie when it came out it was something about guys and drinking and hijinks and whatever or something i thought it would be dumb and obnoxious but after they made a couple of sequels i looked it up and saw that it had actually been wellreceived and was supposed to be quite funny so i watched itthe movie is something about guys and drinking it is pretty dumb and it is very funny the idea of a group of guys waking up after a night of boozing with no memory of what happened and having to retrace their steps is done well following a certain logic for all its craziness the performances are quite good and in spite of its mix of booze drugs prostitutes boxes tigers chickens and tasers theres actually something kind of sweet about this story although im not quite sure whyanyway its funny watch it,comedy
this is one of the funniest movies of recent yearsmuch funnier than the sequels four friends head out to las vegas for a bachelor party before one of them has a wedding they wake up the next morningwith no memory of the previous night one friend and one friends tooth missing and a tiger and a baby in the room they spend the remainder of the film trying to piece together the events of the previous eveningmy favorite scenes are the ones in heather grahams apartment the one with mike tyson the one where zg tries to make blood brothers with them and the wedding scene overall this was marvelously funny with great cast chemistry out of ,comedy
one of the funniest movies to come out in a long time and the highest grossing rrated comedy of its time the was just laugh after laugh and usually only one film a year from hollywood makes you do that anymorewhat really works in this film is the overall setting the city of sin and broken dreams is probably the worst place to ever forget what you did the night previously these guys do and just how the story unravels more and more towards the inevitable end is just such an intensely funny journey the payoff succeeds in every way and considering the directors previous work this far is his best so far so congratulations todd phillipsall the characters are wonderful and anyone should be able to instantly connect and like one of them but by far the obvious audience favourite is going to be the dumbbearded crusader alan garner played by zach galiffianakis his slow witted delivery make for some real great dumbass jokes and how ed helms and bradley cooper dont strangle him is beyond me throw in heavyweight giant mike tyson an eccentric campy asian gang lord and you surprisingly have a movie capable of a winning handfinal verdict had me laughing from beginning to end i dont think ive had that kind of comedic entertainment for a long time 810,comedy
this is one of those movies that will appeal to those of us who have woken up in the morning and cannot remember a thing about what happened the night before but one thing you know is because you feel so bad means that you must have had a lot of fun however this film turns that experience into a murder mystery  minus the body and the detectives rather the heroes of the wake up in a hotel in las vegas with a bunch of stuff and a missing groom and have forty eight hours to work out what happened to him before they have to tell his bride to be that he is not coming backthis movie is great the first time around but even when you know what has happened and the solution to the puzzle it is still a heaps fun movie to watch in a way it sets a standard that other movies of a similar genre are going to find hard to beat in a way it has set a new standard with the good old detective movies namely because it appeals to those of us who have got so wasted the night before that we simply cannot remember a thing about that night and then spend the next day and sometimes your entire life trying to piece all of the clues together to actually try and work out what it was you did that night and why it was so fun,comedy
the is the first movie of one epic trilogy i think that this movie is the best of this trilogy because it was something that i had never seen when i first watched this movie i laughed very much i found it a very interesting and pioneering moviezach galifianakis makes a really great interpretation and i learned him from this movie i also liked the interpretations of bradley cooper and ed helms and i think that both of them had a great time while filming and that is something that appears in whole of the movieas you can understand from the title of the movie all the movie has to do with a big and the memory of these three friends who lost their memory,comedy
i first watched the about 3 years ago and absolutely fell in love with it having watched it again this evening i must admit that i didnt love it quite as much as the first time i watched it but it is a still a winner in my opinionthe plot is very simple and focuses on four friends alan galifianakis phil cooper stu helms and doug bartha all heading to las vegas for a bachelor party prior to dougs wedding to alans sister tracy sasha barrese once in vegas the lads decide to celebrate dougs last night of freedom in style which involves plenty of booze and plenty of gambling in the casinos the following day the men all wake up worse for wear as the title of the film implies but theres a problem the groom doug is missing and the lads cant remember what they did the night before and therefore they have no idea where to start looking the men find themselves in a race against time to try and find doug in order to get him back to la in time for his weddingthere are several aspects that make the work firstly there is the script  john lucas and scott moore have clearly put some thought into the script as there were many surprises along the way most of which are as a direct consequence of the lads drunken behaviour i found some of the twists in the to be pretty effective and as a result i found myself more and more engrossed in the film secondly all the characters had a certain likable quality about them although they still cause mayhem post they all still have a certain charm about them and a lot of the time they find themselves in ridiculous situations and doing ridiculous things all in a bid to try and find their lost friend so for that reason it is hard to dislike them thirdly the chemistry between the 3 leads was also really good cooper galifianakis  helms all worked well together  they are all very different characters who all think very differently which caused them to bicker quite a lot which was funny in itselfthe is a very funny film with a few surprises that can be found along the way whilst i dont believe it is the funniest film ive ever seen it certainly is a funny film that you should definitely check out,comedy
freshly envisioned skilfully directed  brilliantly performed the is a rollercoaster ride of quality entertainment that simply ranks amongst the finest comedies to come out in the past decade for the film is full of hilarious moments crazy characters  an engaging storyline that never goes dull for a momentthe tells the story of 4 friends who travel to las vegas to celebrate the bachelor party of one of their own only to wake up the next day with no memory of what happened the previous night  discover that the bachelor himself is missing the plot follows their search as they try to find him before his impending marriagedirected by todd phillips the brims with freshness thats not easily found in the genre of comedy today and is crafted with deft elegance phillips direction does complete justice to its quality screenplay  balances all aspects of storytelling from start to finish for there are enough genuinely funny moments that never feel forced  characters are finely refined as wellthe also benefits from its dynamic camerawork  effective use of warm colour palette that captures las vegas in all its glory editing is one of its finest aspects for the story is briskly paced trims out the unnecessary moments  keeps the entertainment going throughout its 100 minutes of runtime and the soundtrack incorporates songs that simply fit its narrativecoming to the performances the cast comprises of bradley cooper zach galifianakis ed helms  justin bartha in the role of four friends and all of them chip in with breakthrough performances with zach being the highlight however what makes this film amazing isnt its characters but the interplay between them and the chemistry between these actors goes a long way in making that part work in the films favouron an overall scale the is a highly enjoyable wildly entertaining  endlessly fun cinema thats polished in all aspects of filmmaking manages to retain its quality all the way  is a welcome addition to the genre of rrated comedy its not without its shortcomings but the positives far outweighs the negatives while the charm of its cast brushes away the other complaints and where most comedies fail the simply succeeds,comedy
a group of men embark on las vegas to have a weekend on the town before 2 of them get married well they have a blast get drunk wake up the next morning and they lose their buddy everything is foggy for the men as they have their worst yet not knowing what they have done or where they have been they dont have a clue where to look for their buddy and they have to get him home so he can get married by the next day this movie has so many laughs its hard to catch youre breath from the non stop gags in this movie familiar premise redone but this one seems more in touch with todays times not a lot of major a list stars in this so expectations for me as to the characters played werent that big overall its a barrel of laughs not to be missed will definitely recommend to anyone looking for some great laughs,comedy
with the exception of one character more later in this review i found this movie filled with male sophomoric humor having said that most of the females in the audience also enjoyed it kind of an equal opportunity movie to offend all sexes equallyunlike most trailers that show all the humor in a 60 second clip this movie will throw so many funny situations at you so quickly that you will be giggling nonstop for the first hourthen the introduction of the mr chow part  essential for the plot but played way over the top by ken jeong  became distracting up to that point bradley cooper ed helms justin bartha and zach galifianakis carried the movie briskly and with real chemistry zach galifianakis in particular was brilliant who is this guy the last 30 minutes were not as good as the first hour and i found the ending somewhat forcedhowever everyone i talked with after the movie will be seeing it again this is one movie that is as funny as advertisedof course i will get flamed by those who find this kind of humor too low brow for their tastes hey just know what youre getting into when you see this,comedy
i saw this movie a year after its release during that year the was being talked about by everyone everyone was saying how good and funny it was after seeing it i must say that i was disappointed i laughed a couple of times but only because i was in a good mood and some jokes were smart but these were forced laughs the movie was well written with a good cast and story line but it wasnt that funny i didnt laugh on impulse once for me a good comedy is one that really makes you laugh and you get really connected with the characters cause thats what comedies are supposed to do right make you laughthe just didnt do that for me im giving it an 8 for a couple of reasons 1 it was well written 2 good story 3 good cast 4 many people seemed to enjoy itmaybe if i saw it when it came out i would have enjoyed it more but i dont think so personally i didnt like it because it didnt make me laugh once but humor is subjective so im not being too hard on it,comedy
this movie is just funny beyond belief and wait for it it actually has a decent script to add on to it were calling it a movie at the request of mr todd phillips now what made this film great wasnt the scenarios that the wolf pack got themselves into even though they were hilarious but it was the dialogue that lead us into through and out of vegas the dialogue was so creative and in the end was hilarious and is almost instantly quotable at least it was back when it came out in 09 with that and a cast that basically made everyone rich particularly bradley cooper and zach galifianakis everything worked out much like every great movie that is marketable it became the victim of a less then worthy sequel that wasnt written by phillips and in the end will keep this film from being remembered as one of the best comedies of all time praying that this last sentence will be wrong but only time will tell,comedy
ever since wedding crashers there seems to be a winning hollywood formula for comedies include as much shock valuegross out humor as possible and intermittently sprinkle in some scenes that allow actors to deliver equally shocking and of course witty dialogue that doesnt give the audience much chance to catch its breath for the duration of two hours the sticks to this formula in many ways but it also surpasses it on several levels the random seemingly haphazard nature of the events which occur in the are just enough to separate the film as a worthwhile entry into the ever expanding catalogue of rrated comediesif youve seen the trailers for the youre already familiar with the plot doug billings is getting married and his buddies phil and stu have decided to treat him to a prewedding weekend bash in las vegas also along for the ride is dougs soon to be brotherinlaw alan more about the brilliant performance of zach galifianakis later once there the group quickly heads out for a night on the town when they awaken the next morning their 4200 per night villa is completely demolished and theres a tiger in the bathroom strangely they have absolutely no memory of the previous evenings occurrences they soon discover that doug is missing and realize that in order to find himand ensure that hes home in time for his own weddingthey have to play detective and figure out exactly what happenedthis is one of the few movies ive seen that actually benefits from a plot that feels cobbled together it literally seems as if the writers decided that they needed a a baby in a cabinet b mike tyson singing c a stolen police car d a scene with the main players getting shot with a taser all of this serves to highlight the eccentric nature of the and its characters especially that of alan garner honestly everyone else in the movie pales in comparison to alan and his antics be it his decision to use carlos the baby as a puppet his assumption that wearing white pants a tee shirt and satchel out onto the casino floor is perfectly acceptable or his questioning the clerk at the front desk of caesars palace about whether or not the actual caesar lives there galifianakas delivers each and every one of his lines with an uncanny amount of deadpan wit that you almost feel sorry for everyone elseessentially theyre all playing the straight man to his characterto avoid revealing too much about the developments in the suffice it to say that theres no way they wouldve ever gotten out of vegas given the stunts they pull the movie is aware of its own ridiculousness which is perhaps just as well but i wouldve liked to have seen these guys really sweat things out and get their just desserts with the exception of alan they all throw a few temper tantrums but we all know how things will concludeand in the end things do play out exactly as youd expect them too making this not quite as risky as say another ridiculous selfaware comedy pineapple expressso all of that taken into consideration whats the verdict on the its funnyat times downright hilarious in many ways weve seen it all before but the quirky nature of alanand the seemingly random plot developmentsmake it stand out if youre looking for a carefree night at the movies the is a sure bet,comedy
the thing that made this movie so good is that nobody saw it coming these three guys who seemed to be lost in a world of adulthood get stuck with a baby and a missing groom and a wedding that they need to get too while they have no idea of what happened the night before the movie delivers a shocker in the acting area and the script was funny to the core that you dont feel you have seen this movie till you watch it a second timethe was a big financial success and it helped propel the careers of the three lead actors making more than 12 times its production cost the studio just had to make a part ii which was not as good as this initial one as it featured same people doing practically the same thing that led to what happened in the first the movie plot was inspired by a real life event that happened to tripp vinson a movie producer tripp had gone missing from his own las vegas bachelor party blacking out and waking up in a strip club jon lucas and scott moore took the tale and drafted a script which they sold to warner bros for over 2 million the movie director todd phillips went ahead to add additional elements to the script to put in more life into it and extra adventures he added such like mike tyson and his tiger the baby and the police cruiserthe movie plot is about vegas gone wrong doug justin bartha and tracy sasha barrese are about to get married so dougs two best friends phil bradley cooper and stu ed helms decided to take him for a bachelor party in vegas tagging along was tracys brother alan zach galifianakis while in vegas the four had a night out and then the worst thing happened they woke up the next day knowing they had the time of their lives but cant remember what happened to make it worse there is a tiger in the bathroom the groom doug is missing and they are with a baby whom they know not where he came fromthe movie was shot in like two weeks and it is a must watch to all movie lovers that is for sure there is plan to make a third movie the part ii was released in 2011 it was not as critically accepted as the first but the box office sales was just as impressive so with that on their side the studio will be taking a chance with a part three filming of the part iii began in september 2012 and is set for release in may 2013wwwlagsreviewscom,comedy
this film is certainly the funniest film i have seen in my life i have found most comedies over the last couple of years to be extremely worth to watch and i started to worry that i didnt have a sense of humour but this film proves that i was right and all the other comedies that have been made recently were wrong the hagover made me think that i should watch all the series of film in the future well it is definite that i will suggest to people who ask me whether i know any comedy film to watch and have a nice time of course there are lots of films like that to watch but the point which differ from others for this one is its charming sense of humour,comedy
no offense to seth rogen johan hill paul rudd will farrell et al but what a refreshing sight it was to see a buddybromance movie without them starring in it the guys especially galifianakis in the all could hold their own and crack me up each had their own depth each was interesting though somewhat clichd and each i rooted for despite their downfalls what couldve been the same ole same ole bachelor party in vegas movie turned out surprisingly original funny and at times a suspenseful mystery three guy friends and a future brotherinlaw head off to vegas for the said bachelor romp two days prior to the groom dougs wedding after a night they did forget and loosing doug they must put the pieces together to find him and return him to la and his bride along the way they of course encounter the kooky characters you would expect from this type of comedy as well as a rooster a tiger and tyson oh my being overhyped prior to its release had me worried as did the tyson cameo but both the movie and the former boxer delivered tenfold even the movie itself was well shot vegas is shown as it really is consistent construction  though they were as updated as they could be still some unfinished projects in the film such as westgate at planet hollywood have already been completed still it was the most realistic footage of vegas ive seen sure it had some stock shots but mostly it was real all the men were hilarious and it was nice they were given depth but the bearded third wheel alan really stood out with trueness and sympathy instantly one of my alltime favorite vegas movies and i could see this becoming a future cult classic,comedy
the directed by todd philips is one of the best comedy movies i have ever witnessedthe movie right from its start till it ends is like a laughing gas which never stopsstory angelenos doug billings justin bartha and tracy garner sasha barrese are about to get married two days before the wedding the four men in the wedding party  doug dougs two best buddies phil wenneck bradley cooper and stu price ed helms and tracys brother alan garner zach galifianakis  hop into tracys fathers beloved mercedes convertible for a 24hour stag party to las vegas phil a married high school teacher has the same maturity level as his students when hes with his pals stu a dentist is worried about everything especially what his controlling girlfriend melissa rachael harris thinks because she disapproves of traditional male bonding rituals stu has to lie to her about the stag he telling her that they are going on a wine tasting tour in the napa valley regardless he intends on eventually marrying her against the advice and wishes of his friends and alan seems to be unaware of what are considered the social graces of the western world the morning after their arrival in las vegas they awaken in their hotel suite each with the worst none remembers what happened in the past twelve or so hours the suite is in shambles and certain things are in the suite that shouldnt be and certain things that should be in the suite are missing probably the most important in the latter category is doug as phil stu and alan try to find doug using only what little pieces of information they have at hand they go on a journey of discovery of how certain things got into the suite and what happened to the missing items however they are on a race for time as if they cant find doug in the next few hours they are going to have to explain to tracy why they are not yet back in los angeles and even worse they may not find doug at all before the weddingtheres even another character named chow who comes toward the end of the moviethe reason why i mentioned the character is because he is one actor for whom must be watchedhe is so damn funny the direction is marvelousthe dialogs are the icing of the cakespecial mention of those delivered by chow in the end or even delivered by zach galifianakis at several scenesperformances also works because of some superb performances delivered by its castspecial mention of zach galifianakis who just simply stands out with his amazing comic timingbradely cooper is very goodwhile ed helms is funnyheather grahamsasha barresejeffrey tambor and rachael harris are fine ken jeong as chow is truly a scenestealerrob riggle and cleo king as the cops are hilariousmike tyson in a cameo is awesomeall in allis an excellent comedy moviei am giving it a nine on tengohave a laugh,comedy
people get caught up in hype that surrounds films far to often i kept hearing how this is the funniest film for years i watched it and smiled once the characters were so predictable much like the jokes and the story the stupid brainless guy that gets everyone else in trouble stifler with a beard and less funny the geeky looser that is a born victim the guy that has a good job and family but acts a fool with his friends vince vaughn in old school the formula has just been used too many times ive given it a 4 because it wasnt the worst film ever and had it been released 10 years ago it probably would have been quite different and funny at points if you want to watch a better version of a pre wedding mishap film try batchelor party 2 i found that much better film,comedy
we had heard a lot about this movie prior to watching all i can say is what a disappointment it really wasnt that funny a few amusing moments but never once did we laugh out loud or have to stop the movie because we missed something due to the laughterthis doesnt compare to older classic comedies such as caddyshack or animal house and it is a shame to even have this compared to those old school was still much funnier than this zach g is not funny at all except in a goofy way i dont understand what the big hype is over this movie or how anyone can rate it as one of the best comedies of all time,comedy
this movie is completely brainless i dont think that a movie filled with toilet jokes without a hint of intelligence is necessarily bad sometimes its good to watch something like down the periscope police academy or the like but usually those movies have a corresponding rating on imdb i do not see how is in any way superior to any of the movies of its kind it is forgettable and bland i do not say that it is completely unfunny but neither is it original if you need to waste about 2 hours of your life while drinking a couple of beers with friends this movie is not a bad choice although not the best in my opinion but you would also not miss a thing if you never watched ,comedy
highly original mix of raunchy comedic snappy dialogue and absurdist situations the is the comedy you always wondered why hollywood doesnt make the movie manages to combine the smarts and observation of juno with the absurdist situations of marx brothers movies and frames all of it in an rrated las vegas romp the nonlinear narrative structure makes for a rewatchable film that is destined to be a cultural touchstone along the lines of stripes better off dead and the revenge of the nerds series best comedy since tropic thunder although that was a better and more substantial film,comedy
gisselle corralthe movie is funny based on every aspect you can imagine the movie is about taking a road trip to las vegas  nevada to celebrate the bachelor party for justin bartha who will be getting married and accompanied by his closest friends bradley cooper the dentist  and ed helmszach galifianakis who is part of the movie and is justins friend gave justin roofis  towards the middle of the movie they do not recall what had happened the night before  and justin was missing during the vegas trip still going on the friend who was a dentist end up getting married without being in a relationship  and wasnt conscious of what he was doing because they were all drunk,comedy
the is truly funny but it is better than funnyfirst there is the plot friends wake up in a hotel room and cant remember a thing but although this is quite good already it is only the starting point what is truly funny and truly creative is their subsequent quest there is a wealth of original ideas of unexpected things in all 2x or 3x more material and ideas than is found in your average flickand the acting is quite good perfect for this kind of film no one is the star no one takes themselves too seriouslynuff said go watch it,comedy

first of all i do not like that much of american comedy movies i only watch regional comedy movies which have clean comedies and nice dialogs and all some english humor movies that i watched was hell like tragedy but i liked this one nice dialogs situations surprises and a great climax what more do you want a movie like this the casting is superb very good direction and especially the soundtracks are greater than ever the events are its beauty it really tempts you not to go out of the cinema even at the interval its not a family type of movie it is the one your mom is warning you about but you know what it gives us the real pleasure of it if you once watched this you will watch this at least two more times it was with my friends that i watched this movie we were expected a limed comedy thriller and what we got was real pain in the stomach by laughing after the movie we were talking nothing but about it until bedsome of them had an opinion that it will be better to avoid that much vulgarity from it but i am quiet sure that it will kill the fun of it so for any normal conservative indian guy it is not the movie you want to go with the family and have a nice dinner there after it is a movie that you go with your friend laugh like hell make some noise thrill with fun and have a beer withit is like the traditional indian in me is freaking out shamelessly scolding it but the man in me slaps it and saying this is what you need  yeah i agrees it this is a once in lifetime movie for us what moreits classic,comedy
the vegas comedy done right mostly because the is actually funny very funny as the guys start out on their bachelor party trip to las vegas we quickly get a sense of how funny this will be because of the sense of humour the characters have phil bradley cooper is completely unscrupulous but thats okay hes only a school teacher alan zach galifianakis thinks the prospect of killing someone or being killed is absolutely hilarioustheir tame night becomes morning and questions need to be answered in order of increasing severity whose baby is in the minifridge why is there a tiger in the bathroom will alan put his pants on and where is doug finding doug will answer the other questions but it will also take all day and all night and raise more questions that need answeringthis works because we want to find the answers the questions which we start with are just so outrageous original and intriguing that we know they will be funny along the way we also want to find doug hes the sane and normal one so surely our world will be righted once we find himthe achieved greatness because people werent expecting it hollywood didnt produce it so to the masses it came out of nowhere it made bradley cooper a movie star zach galifianakis a fearless comedian and gave ed helms the respect he deserved im hoping part ii will do the same for justin bartha but its hard to come out of nowhere after hollywood has hyped it for two years,comedy
the is the newest hit comedy about a bachelor party gone wrong when the groom goes missing and the group of friends tries to remember what happened the previous night due to a terrible the film goes through vegas drugs strippers herpes and so many things drinking can cause as they try to find their friend before the wedding the was a completely hilarious take on the famous bachelor party flicks the film has the highest laughter and the best expectations to be found the casting of bradley cooper ed helms zach galifanakis justin bartha and ken jeong were hilarious and impressive but its galifanakis who stole the show in every scene he is in with his quirky dialouge and timing director todd phillips arranged the movie so well and he made a movie that made me laugh out loud throughout the film had a hilarious wellwritten script and a super cast and the film will remind us what will happen if we take a guys night out too far this film had so many funny moments we cant stop remembering them the film was an awesome and hilarious flick now i learned a valuable lesson on what will might happen at age 21 in las vegas with bottles of beer in your hand and containing a motherloads of drunken herpes the in my review a truly hilarious flick to watch again and again,comedy
todd phillips director has done a good job with the just as he has in a previous movie old school phillips previous movie pertaining to old school is filled with good actorsactress dialogue and comedy both of phillips movies old school and the are full with comedy and action that will have tears coming out and on your knees phillips along with writers jon lucas and scott moore have set out to do what they planned to delivery throughout this movie you will see the different in lowkey lightinghighkey lighting motifs and angles lowhigh and the music as scenes are being transiting the was filmed in las vegas nevada doug billing is about to marry one of his friends alan garner sister tracy garner in two days doug and alan along with two of their other buddies phil wenneck and stu price are off to las vegas for a couple of days for some male bonding phil a high school teacher and married tends to acts childish when with his pals stu a dentist has a girlfriend by the name of melissa shes very controlling and is very much against stu going on this male bonding trip one day he hopes to eventually marry melissa however alan seems to be on another level with the social graces of the western world the next day after arriving in las vegas they all wake up with the worst the suite is in stumbles and things are where they shouldnt be and missing they cant remember anything that happens within the last 12 plus hours one element for sure is that doug is missing therefore they are running out of time before they are due to be back in los angeles if not back than they will have to do some explaining to tracy what they havent returned in one scene you will see where all four of them are on the roof top in las vegas toasting to doug last night as a single man the scene is relevant to the theme because it takes place in vegas and the scenery is great just imaging the lighting along with the setting its great the other technique that was used in this movie angles the scene was when phil and stu were outside looking in the truck of the car and there goes that great shot of the sky and mandalay bay hotel its funny to watch men to exploit their insecurities the was a smash for 2009 i hope to see more of doug alan phil and stu in upcoming movies because they were great phillips when will we see the ii,comedy
this movie was absolutely one of the funniest movies ive ever seen i laughed so hard i almost choked and died and it would have been a good way to gothis movie is epic like up there with spinal tap i kept laughing for days the only way i can think to describe it if pulp fiction had a baby with the wedding crashers and gave it up for adoption to the three stooges the movie has that weird skewedworld feeling to it the language is outrageous  theres not a ton of violence but whats there is like omg things dont quite make sense you have to just roll with it and embrace the randomness  but its easy to do that because the wackiness is peeyourpants hysterical the characters are utterly irreverent and so likable a few times i couldnt catch my breath i was laughing so hard oh shtjust watch it,comedy
four friends go off to las vagas for a bachelor party only the next morning none of them can remember what happened the night before what makes matters worse is that the soon to be groom doug has gone missingnow phil stu and alan must retrace their steps and find doug and take him to the church in timei had my reservations about i just felt that it was not going to live up to the hype but i was wrong the storyline is not the most original but the characters and script dialogue make it one of the best the actors are perhaps the greatest asset of the film zach ed and bradley have amazing chemistry something that truly shows in the film i am especially fond of stus song pure brilliance tysons cameo was quite funny as wellbut one thing i loved about the movie was every now and then there would be a scene in slow motion with an amazing soundtracklike the rainman scene as they come down the stepsbrilliant,comedy
i am a teenager and every day at school kids would talk non stop about the how funny it was etc i finally got the time to watch it and was very disappointed i expected the movie to be the greatest comedy of all time instead i got a moderate comedy with a bad story linethe plot for the movie is very unoriginal they copied dude wheres my car and a simpsons episode  homer and ned travel to las vegas with hilarious consequences the flashbacks were very clichd and not funnytheir were a few jokes in here that made me chuckle but not laugh zach galifinafkis had a very unfunny part and bradley cooper didnt have any funny jokes neither was stui expected a great comedy but got a flopper did i expect too much with this movie or did i just not get how this movie was a masterpiece,comedy
the has got to be one the funniest movies to come out between the dirty humor and the constant stupidity it had everyone cracking up the movie is mostly about these four guys who set out to go to las vegas for their buddys bachelor party and end up losing him they spend the whole movie looking for him because they have no memory of what happened hence the movie name the i mostly enjoyed this movie because it keeps people my age super entertained and excited for the next one they come out with in my mind there will never be a funny movie to beat this one and there isnt one that even comes close to touching the fantastic acting played in this moviei would recommend that everyone see this movie once they reach the appropriate age,comedy
the first time i saw this film i was in a packed norwalk theater the woman next to me was grabbing my arm and i nearly ripped a gut laughing so hardthe next time i saw it i was alone with my dvd the woman had long ago married another guy and geez somehow my enthusiasm barely crept into canter modeso was i at fault or was it really a its probably the fault of being such a party movie if you are having a party you are only going to enjoy the vegas decadence the numbskull wisecracks the whiplash plot twists if you are watching this from something of a sociallyisolated remove you might find it more of a laughbegging lowestcommondenominator comedy that doesnt work hard enough to make you carethe idea of four men celebrating a final night of bachelorhood has been done enough times already the shakes things up by making the comedy a bit of a mystery at the outset where did the groom disappear to and why is there a tiger in the bathroom the grooms two best friends and prospective brotherinlaw have less than 48 hours to find outif there was one thing i was really amused by the first time it was zach galifianakiss turn as the goofy hirsute manbaby alan garner dont let the beard fool you hes a child as dr stu ed helms tells a wouldbe attacker but the next time i saw the film i stumbled over the previouslyoverlookedfact alan is presented as a child molester with a recordi guess thats the films way of being edgy like by mentioning 911 and the holocaust other jokes seem less winning too particularly a segment where the core trio is picked up by the law and another where they run into heather graham who would be the worst actor in the film if not for a former heavyweight championone thing that improved my enjoyment the third time around was the realization from reading the imdb comments that bradley coopers star character phil is supposed to be a jerk and not just a cool guy who wears fantastic sunglasses he actually fits into that part quite well without delivering an overbearing performance like dr stus fiance who director todd phillips makes sure we hate from the first minute shes ongood things in the film include a speech from alan about forming a wolfpack and some stray surveillance footage involving a tiger as i said the whole opening section develops an interesting story but the rest of the film lets this slide for cheap laughs alan even asks a pretty hotel clerk at caesars palace if caesar himself really lived therea good comedy like any other movie is a film for all seasons not just when life is good and everyone is laughing the feels too much like the title condition by the end,comedy
okay look ill admit that it is a little funny and i am okay with the stupid sophomoric humor after all that is what makes a lot of movies great but come on people a 79 rating 270 million in box office sales lets get real here not only is this a blatant ripoff of so many movies but its the same tired old stupid humor more importantly there is a very similar yet very witty brilliant movie out there that has been criminally neglected while this mediocre dimeadozen film achieves so much acclaim people do not waste your hard earned money on a movie that the masses say you should like instead check out the movie very bad things in case you dont remember it this little gem came out back in 98 it is about a group of guys taking their soon to be married buddy to vegas for a bachelor party much like the they have an outrageous party with booze and drugs and a hooker the hooker ends up dead and the group decides to cover the whole thing up so they can get their buddy back home to be married and to continue their lives as normal of course things are not that simple and the coverup leads to more death and the web of lies getting spun even tighter christian slater leads a awesome cast of familiar faces including cameron diaz in this hugely under rated blackcomedy by director peter berg if you loved heathers youll at the very least like this movie i promise most of you will like it better than the give it a try let me know what you think this might not be the best comedy ever but the offbeat humor along with good story telling genuinely funny characters and witty dialog put the to shame,comedy
this movie has its moments but i will never really get what makes this one of the greatest comedies of all time none of the verbal humor was funny only the physical gags made me laugh and i really wish there was more of them the only ounce of talent in this film is from zack galifianakis who is actually a good actor and is worth watching but the other characters in the film are some of the most annoying talentless unfunny people i have ever seen i really tried to give this movie a chance i watched it twice but it just didnt click with me and in my opinion its really overappreciated try it out for sure its not my kind of comedy but it might be yours,comedy
this film delivers solely on its premise and basically just that however it does this incredibly well with a flowing plot that delivered constant laughs the cast consist of bradley cooper ed helms although zack galifianakis definitely was the funniest person in the whole picture justin bartha didnt end up doing much but i enjoyed his moments in the flick as well as anyone knows the plot is as simple as they come leaving no real character development aside ed helms character and so with that said this film definitely delivers in the aspect of sheer outrageous comedy in a way that was nicely natural and unforced but i could not rate it as high as super bad or pineapple expressmike epps and ken jeong were actually more memorable than the actual cast of protagonists but it all blends together as probably the funniest film in a while and oh yeah jeffrey tambor was in it wish hed had a larger role because as ive seen in the hellboy films he can be pretty funny at times,comedy
the a comedy film was written by jon lucas and scoot moore and directed by todd phillips the plot of the story is how four friends decide to go to las vegas to have a bachelor party for their friend doug justin bartha when they wake up from their crazy night of fun alan zack galifianakis the brotherinlaw to be stew ed helms his friend the orthodontist that doesnt have a backbone when it comes to his girl friend and phil bradley cooper the school teacher that bribed money from his students in order to go on the trip low and behold doug is gone and they cannot remember a thing that happened that night with little time to spare the three hazy pals try to retrace their steps and find doug so they can get him back to los angeles in time to walk down the aisle we have to find our friend and soon is a theme of what has the grooms wedding party in this situation of not being able to locate their friend doug having to hurry up remember what has happened and to get back to los angeles in time for the wedding lighting for the was always very bright and colorful there was never a scene were everything seemed dark or gloomy even after they woke and realized that doug was gone the lighting was still bright at night when their car got hit by mr chow the street was very well lit to show that vegas is a town that never sleeps there wasnt a lot of music when it came to this movie most of the sound came from the silly things that they guys did throughout the movie whenever they would go to another scene there would be no noise so that the audience would be able to focus on the actors and what was going onthe s theme closely resembles the theme of road trip road trip is about a guy who mailed a video off of him cheating on his girlfriend and him and his group of friends deciding that they would go with him to go retrieve it they both tie end together because they both show how mistakes can happen and how far people will go to fix them the s theme focused on how three friends having to backtrack their night to find their friend before they miss his wedding,comedy
the is by far the funniest movie of 2009a person took me to the movies for my birthday last year and she suggested hannah montana  i was like no way see the i i had to see this movie when i saw the trailerthe whole audience cried so hard with laughter when i went to see it at the cinema all the main characters were excellent in this movie and my favorite character is alan garner played by zachi think i laughed the hardest with all the scenes he was in itii laugh so hard i cry every time i watch this movie and i have seen it many timesit is very funny from the beginning to the endit is definitely crudeit has a lot of random one linersno matter how many times i will watch this movie it is never going to get oldone of the most funniest movies i have ever seena must see comedyis looking forward to the 2 which i wonder will it top the the 1 no wonder why this is the best selling comedy dvd of all timedefinitely one of my most favorite comedy movies1010 is my rating,comedy
the there was going to be a marriage ceremony between doug billings and tracy garner dough and his two other friends stu and phil and tracys brother alan decided to go on a trip to las vegas alan garners tracys brother always acted like a kid whiles stu had a wife who always gave him a hell of a time and never liked him to hang out with friends and phil a high school teacher liked to act like his students when he was out on trips the theme was basically based on some issues people faced after having so much fun and too much drinking and was also based on comedy in the movie stu alan and phil encountered and issue where they woke up to not find dough in the hotel room and had to look for him they were so knocked out that they didnt remember what had happened earlier on alan and the guys woke up to find a chicken in their room running around and mike tysons tiger in their bathroom in a scene mike tyson came looking for the friends and knocked alan out after seeing them on his security cameras references in the movie were so much based on what happened stu and the rest of the guys in search of doug kept on asking themselves what just happen they were so knocked out that they never realized a single moment of the night and anywhere they went in search of dough everyone will ask them dont you remember all this the angle they shot the movie was in proportion to the detail of the scene they were able to really make sense and actually communicate to audiences also the movie not shot on premises actually had enough lighting for anyone to believe it was actually shot location even at night they were able to produce enough lighting to actually look like vegas the theme actually explained itself in the movie,comedy
ah todd philips oh i remember when you were just beginning in the business youve made such timeless classics as road trip starsky and hutch and of course old school but now you have a new title a new story and cast of new comers who work well together on the big screen the acting and dialogue is very clever and the stories twist was the best twisted ending of the year i particularly enjoyed how the drug ruffian and roof were tied in together to make the twist in the end even more spectacular than anyone could hope for the films swearing could have been toned down a tad and the film does drag on some scenes but then when you least expect it boom out of no where theres a tiger in the bathroom i also feel that the films realistic style gives it a greater sense of humor because things are funnier if they seem like they are really happeningkeep it up make more great films and you are awesome,comedy
i went into this film expecting to laugh but i didnt expect to come out laughing as hard as i wasi couldnt imagine how much effort went into making this film as funny as it was the story characters and most importantly the one liners were all perfectly executedeveryone in the cinema was laughing at every joke to pull that off is amazing ive never seen anything like it before to this day my friends and i talk about how funny it wasboundaries were pushed aes were laughed off tears were cried absolutely brilliant film,comedy
i love this freaking movie it gave me thousands of laugh in a wittingly way the rohypnol flunitrazepam was used here perfectly they stole a police car stole mike tysons tiger married a stripper parked their mercedes in the middle of the road leaving a note that they cannot locate a parking meter they heard a baby crying inside their villa doug was nowhere to be seen there is a chinese man tied up inside their cars trunk they owed the chinese 80000 and they have no idea when how they did it i love the scene at the bathroom where allan was trying to pee and the tiger gnarled at him like it was his territory i love how they were trying to solve the mystery on what happened to them and at the same time trying to locate their friend who was supposed to get married in 5 hours and the worst thing is they do not have any clue where he is they were searching for their friend in the entire city of las vegas where they havent realized that doug was just at the roof topi cant say anything more but i just love this movie,comedy
while i looked at other reviews of this after watching the film it is interesting the extremes that i have seen this is a comedy movie so while i understand folks being offended by some of the humor still humor is supposed to be on the edge in order to be funny maybe the script might have been done before but i have not seen the prior efforts so i will address this filmi kind of like the formula here the movie starts two mornings after the bachelor party was supposed to have started in las vegas it seems no one know where the groom is while talking with the bride too be on the phone she is in a panic then we get the hollywood style flashback beginning 2 days earlier this film centers around the groom to be  3 friends including the brides brother who went to vegas for a bachelor party as the film develops they are on the trail when they wake up after the first night in a hotel suite that is a total wreck with no idea what happened on the path they are trying to explain a tiger in the suite bathroom the grooms bed being thrown off the hotel roof a cop car they stole from the vegas police that night a missing tooth  a missing groomwhat is fun about this movie is how it slowly but surely explains what happened the cameo by mike tyson is on the trail  is very funny there are several women in the cast but the main one is a vegas stripperescort who gets the most screen time  one of the bachelors fianc after that there is little time even given too the bride to be there is some humor here that is politically incorrect but is funny realistically it does come off as a major the thing is why no one can remember is spoiler not alcohol but drugs one thing never explained is the chicken in the hotel room but there is some really sick tiger humor  a crazy gangster that is in the picturethis film really is fun as long as you have a bit of a thick skin not as thick as you need for borat but skin where you can laugh at a joke as the cast performs really well in this movie,comedy
this movie is comedic gold it is filled with great characters an awesome setting a great cast and a well told story usually comedies like this end up being not very good but the does things to make the formula funny1acctually likable characters 2acctually good actors 3an actually good script 4a mystery way of doing the comedy all the great things about the movie are made better by how all this stupid stuff they are doing is unknown to us and to the characters so we learn along with them all the crazy stuff they did the night before it seems strange but having he crazy stuff that happened not being shown to us or remembered by the characters is more funny than us just watching them doing the stupid stuff right in front of our faces we feel the same kind of surprise that they do and that gives way more laughs than if we just followed these guys through their night of being drunk also i found myself very wrapped up in the mystery itself not only was i laughing throughout but i also really wanted to learn with these guys what the did the night before you feel like you were with them in that one crazy night and you want to find out everything that happened too the is much more than your average comedy it manages to breath life into the almost dead genre this and zombieland are both excellent comedies from 09 that signal a possible return of good quality hilarity4 stars out of 4,comedy

when todd phillips announced the viewing of his newest movie the my first instinct was to reject it immediately because my track record with this director hasnt exactly been the best dont get me wrong todd has given us some exceptional stuff over the years road trip was a bit dodgy but overall a funny movie old school wasnt too bad either it did have its moments of enjoyment but i think the moment where phillips really lost my respect was with his 2006 film school for scoundrels i cant even begin to describe what a bad movie that wasanyway my mind was set i wasnt going to set myself up for disappointment again however my friends would not give up until they got me to sit down and watch this movie at one point i believe they even threaten to tie me to a chair and tape my eyelids to my head and make me watch it course i knew they were bluffing but i wasnt going to take the risk so that same weekend i finally i gave in and decided to buy a ticket for the and with great surprise i came out of the cinema cracking myself with laughter its times like this im glad that my friends are dangerously obsessivethe is a huge come back by todd phillips its a breath of fresh air that outwits most of the modern comedies you see now a days the title makes it pretty obvious that its about a group of blokes that have one hell of a night and as a result suffer from hell of a with one of its main symptoms being memory loss after waking up in a trashed apartment with one guy missing the three friends make their way to the streets of las vegas making several stops and gradually putting together the pieces of the puzzle that will hopefully solve the mystery of what happened at the bachelor party as well as mark the location of the soon to be married grooma great thing about this movie is that you dont ever know whats going to happen these guys just go from place to place with no idea of what lies ahead and that in itself leaves for a very funny effect phillips is also very careful to make sure that he doesnt expose too much information about what happened that night the supporting cast only gives a limited bit of info to three main characters so that way it doesnt ruin the ending for the audience as well as maintain the hilarious effect of not being able to determine what kind of unexpected occurrence will take placeapart from it being genuinely funny the also succeeds in delivering an equal balance of character and crudity although they appear somewhat stereotypical stu phil and alan are all consistently amusing figures the chemistry between them is convincing effectively funny and very well portrayed by bradley cooper ed helms and zach galifianakiswith a clever script efficient direction and hilarious autoplay between characters the makes for an overall considerably funny movie about the modern concept of road trip to las vegas,comedy
i enjoyed this film it was hilarious and one of a kind it made me laugh throughout the entire movie defiantly a must see my favorite part was when they found out whos animal it was in there hotel room and the guys reaction i especially found it hilarious when the owner of the animal was found in the room oh and cant forget the random infant that was found and the babys mother good film again a must see i really liked bradly coopers character and stu who was so uptight but loosened up during the film and truly became himself and seemed happier while being wild most movies i dont give such high reviews but this movie defiantly deserved a ten,comedy
over half of the movies i watch are comedies and the is by far the funniest film i have ever seen from start to finish this production will have you out of your seat laughing everything from ironic to dry to crude humor this movie has it all no one will leave disappointed the las vegas setting is perfect too anything is possible in the city of sin and this movie proves just that also having been filmed on the strip and in the actual hotels just adds to the films authenticity and allureafter a hilarious introduction of the characters for the first 20 minutes or so this sidesplitting production heats up really fast after each of the four main characters takes a shot of jagermeister on the roof of caesars palace everything fades to black and the next thing we see is a several thousand dollar a night penthouse in complete ruin the tv is busted theres a chicken running around the room hundreds of beer cans are littered throughout and furniture is tipped over as the three remaining characters wake up after what apparently was a wild and crazy night on the town one character has a missing tooth and another wakes up wearing just a skintight shirt no pants to make matters worse a reallife tiger has found its way into the bathroom and one of the guys from the group is missing setting up the premise for the rest of the filmin their attempt to find their missing buddy the three remaining friends get themselves in and out of serious trouble one is smacked in the face by an angry mike tyson while another finds himself facing the reality of accidentally marrying an exotic dancer the previous night a surprise in the trunk of their car sets up an entire sequence of hilarious and zany eventsplease do yourself a favor rent this movie you wont regret it what happens in vegasdoesnt stay in vegas we get to see it all warning to parents at the end of the movie when the four look through the digital roll of photos from the wild night some extremely sexually explicit material is shown,comedy
slightly concerning time for me to go and see this film as my brother was in hungary on his stag do at the time but this didnt stop me rolling in the aislesset in vegas this tells the story of doug bartha embarking on his stag night with his 2 best friends  cool teacher phil cooper and geeky doctordentist stu helms and his soon to be weird brother in law alan galifianakis  they head out for a night they will never forget and it turns out they do just thatthey wake up the next morning with a tiger in the bathroom a baby in the cupboard and a missing groom the hilarity ensues as they retrace the previous nights steps in a bid to get doug back in time for his wedding cue shot gun weddings camp asian gangsters plenty of gambling and of course mike tysonwhere the film lacks in recognisable faces it certainly makes up for in humour and suspense the story is uncomplicated but keeps you on the edge of your seat as the plot thickens with all that it has to offer its little wonder they didnt feel the need to use an all star cast for me zach galifianakis is the star of the show with his characters lack of social grace and weird dress sensei fully recommend seeing this film with a crowd,comedy
i loved this movie and have seen it a dozen times lots of one liners and funny scenes my favorite scene is with the taze gun i lmao at that one this was a great cast but galifinakis really made me laugh the hardest hes so offbeat its great im really a fan of ed helms too and he always comes up with some funny stuff there was a lot of hype surrounding this movie when it came out but it most definitely delivered for me so many great quotes in this movie too i dont know where to begin the cast really did mesh well together though great supporting performances by rachel harris and even an appearance by the great dan band they perform a couple songs at the end of the movie when the wedding finally occurs i recommend this movie only if you want to laugh your arse off,comedy
take strippers alcohol drugs gambling vegas and combine it with a witty script and you get the base for the of course thats not the entire recipe you still have to add a baby mike epps and mike tyson oh and a tiger while having a good recipe wont guarantee that you can follow it and make it work todd phillips did a great job the actors are what you would imagine if you read the script and tried to picture the character a  o  scott simply said the immaturity of ostensibly grownup american men is an inexhaustible subject or at least one that has yet to exhaust american movie audiences and the wellpaid guys who cater to their entertainment needs todd phillips the director of old school road trip and an hbo documentary called frat house as well as a writer of borat has shown himself to be an adept and tireless connoisseur of male boorishness and stupidity though the crude humor he dispenses is frequently leavened by nuggets of inventiveness and witroger ebert says now this is what im talking about the is a funny movie flat out all the way through its setup is funny every situation is funny most of the dialogue is funny almost line by line at some point we actually find ourselves caring a little about what happened to the missing bridegroom  and the fact that we almost care is funny too and i definitely have to agree with him the movie opens up with phil played by bradley cooper calling dougs fianc to tell her that doug played by justin bartha is missing and that the wedding wont go on the movie then rewinds to the beginning and right away the dialogue brings you to a chuckle and when the laughter begins there seems to be no end to the laughter in sight one hilarious scene after another the provides its audience with very explicit humor this movie definitely wasnt written for children or very philosophical people who look for a deeper meaning in the movie although there are some things that can be interpreted more deeply then intended such as when mr chow played by ken jeong says fat guy falling is funny is only funny because it is a fat guy fat people have been made fun of since i can remember in comedies and dont let me get started with the falling part our entertainment is based around other people getting hurt just look at all the videos on youtube and americas funniest home videos another instance in the movie where we laugh from someone elses pain is after the crew steals the police car they get locked up in county jail and are given an option to participate in an exhibit in exchange for their freedom the four men enter the room with a class full of younger children and then see that they are talking about taser guns and hand tasers needless to say the men are in for a surprise as much as i loved the movie there are a few things that i am not too fond of the script by itself isnt really anything special i am highly sure that a lot of improvising took place on set between the actors as well as the director as well as the script not being the greatest the movie also felt too short in a way i believe they could have extended a few scenes to grab the audience and pull them deeper into the movieall in all i give the movies a strong four and a half stars out of five the movies not perfect but its a comedy if you go to the movie theater or rent it on dvd with the intent of just laughing like a child for an hour or two then this movie is perfect for you just be sure to put the kids to sleep or possibly even stay the night at a friends house just in case,comedy
the a must see if you are looking for guaranteed laughs and a movie that will be entertaining the second and third time then i recommend that you go see the its a laughoutloud comedy about a rather eventful bachelor party it starts when two friends laidback school teacher phil bradley cooper and overly cautious dentist stu ed helms plan a bachelor party for their friend doug justin bartha they are offered a sweet ride by their fatherinlaw to be but its under one condition that they take his chubby comically dimwitted son as well alan zach galifianakis they take a trip to vegas and decide that taking ecstasy will make this a night theyll never forget ironically enough it ends up being a night that any of them can barely remember as what was believed to be ecstasy was actually the memory erasing drug rufilin soon afterwards the movie cuts straight from them toasting to the night to waking up in their room with chickens a baby a wedding ring a missing tooth and a missing groom to be alan awakens first to use the bathroom and to his surprise there is a tiger in there that doesnt look too pleased what follows next is a hilarious journey full of unexpected twists and turns with the ultimate goal of finding their lost buddy michael rechtshaffen wrote it best when he said pretty much all will be explained over the course of the outrageous hourandahalf  and what isnt will be quite graphically dealt with over the end credits the three buddies and a baby to be explained later starts off to find doug and they go about it by attempting to retrace their steps the first twist comes when they ask the valet for their car and he brings them a police car theyre then led to a hospital by the medical bracelet on stus wrist that is where they find out that they actually took rufilin what follows next is a further hilarious sequence of events including a naked small asian man jumping out of their truck and beating them senseless with a tire iron and alan getting punched by mike tyson the blend of diverse characters in this sidesplitting comedy is perfect as alans antics are just the thing that sets off stu and only someone as laid back as phil could balance out the situation and keep the movie going along with great writing the physical humor was just as hilarious especially during the scene where they found their selves in some pretty hot water down at the precinct joe leydon of variety writes the humor is unapologetically raunchy  a closingcredits photo montage includes some borderline nc17 naughtiness the story is tied together pretty well which makes it an overall good movie and if you are looking for frequent laughs the is a great choice,comedy
what happens in vegas uhhh what happened in vegasits not exactly bachelor party 1984 but the is a raunchy surprising stab at lewd crude nude immortalityphil bradley cooper stu ed helms and alan zach galifianakis are three friends who wake up in a vegas hotel room the night after throwing their pal justin bartha a bachelor party the room looks like it was just visited by hunter s thompson there is a tiger in the bathroom a baby in the closet and they cant find the groomthe reeks of two writers jon lucas and scott moore getting hammered one night and trying to talk their way out of getting bitchbeaten by chinese gangsters which is kinda what the is  one long excuse wrapped in a rationalization and pinched on the bottom of ludicrous todd phillips cowriter borat directs this descent into surrealismjustin bartha who had nothing to do in those nicolas cage movies here finds that even in a movie where hes got something to do they cant find anything for him to do as he disappears for most of the moviethrough tiny successive clues  a hospital bracelet the fact that theyve got a police car instead of their hire car receipts from various vendors the name of a wedding chapel  the three friends work their way backwards revealing their night of debauchery piece by piecethey discover they were victims of the daterape drug roofies  which their doctor calls ruphalyn upon looking it up it is called rohypnol or flunitrazepam  which accounts for their lack of memorythe three friends have such a tight dynamic we feel weve seen them before  and we have the three stooges the smart nominal leader phil is obviously the moe of the bunch ive not seen bradley cooper in a more funny more likable role proving hes got the alist chops to carry a movie the wacky cuddly pudding bear alan is curly galifianakis uses every ounce of his overweight to milk the hilarity also shooting his star into alist territory and the middle one  er whatsisname  is whatsisname here uh stu the redheaded child of the bunch proxy for literal redhead larry and like larry ed helms does nothing special except bridge the other twobut he does marry heather graham shes the stripper who owns the kid in the closet and guys she gets her knox out for mammary purposes mike tyson cameos and shows us why hes still not an actorin a laugh out loud movie reference when they need to buy back the groom from chinese gangsters chinese kingpin played ever so scrotumly by ken jeong alan convinces them to gamble for the money so descends to the casino dressed like rain man to make it come full circle justin bartha did play a retarded guy in gigli now it all makes sense rob riggle the daily show as a taserhappy cop with the best line as he calls for a volunteer from our friends come here handsome and chubby bearded alan steps forward  no not you fat jesus slide on back there shot in and around sunny las vegas with its snappy dialog and breezy insouciant verve the exudes a heady excitement and an overall feeling of blissful meaningless fun  after all we all relate the vegas skyline to good times few of us work there and even if we had bad experiences there the boundless possibilities of vegas still stir our blood to boilingand thankfully as the friends drive into vegas with perfunctory aerial establishing shot the source music is not elviss obligatory a little less conversation instead cant tell me nothing by kanye west someone alert nicolas cage the elvis song awesome and apropos though it is has become such a clich that for this original departure alone the can daterape me any night,comedy
there isnt a real flaw in this movie its great comedy i had to laugh a lot this isnt one of the movies which are simply too silly to be funny even though its comedy this is no stupid movie at all great conversations a great and unusual story  with lots of surprises yeah yeah of course a lot is predictable once you understood the logic of the movie still its great fun and the most fun are all the crazy characters in this movieso why didnt i give this movie 9 or 10 points  the main reason is probably that i prefer different kind of movies i like movies that try to teach you something or movies that move you emotionally in an extreme way visuals and the music are very important for that in this movie visuals and the music hasnt been impressive at all and beside i did laugh harder in other movies even though this movie might be in the top 20 of the funniest movies i have ever seen,comedy
this is a really funny movie im glad i got a chance to see this but unfortunately it had to wait until dvd i chose to watch the newest harry potter movie instead of this but i think it was a good choice anyway i wasnt expecting much but i heard so much about this film and i see why everyone likes thison the day before dougs wedding day he and his friends decided to get drunk and have a party when they woke up the next morning doug was missing now they have to find doug before the wedding or else theyre screwedthere are many hilarious jokes in here my favorite scenes involved the tiger and the baby i just loved the baby scene i really cant wait to see 2 i rate this film 910,comedy
definitely did not expect this to be anywhere near as good as it was the drunk buddies doing dumb stuff format is a good formula for comedy but it has been overused however this movie refreshes the premise with some clever humor and innovative situationsthe three groomsmen who take their engaged friend on a wild bachelor party adventure to vegas at first appear run of the mill stereotypes of the boozerbuddies genre the dumb fat guy motif makes you think here we go again but they balance routine gags like that with a story that makes some roller coaster twists that usually work as things unfold as to what actually went on during their blackout the plot gains more and more steam the story is constructed well showing believable and likable characters in other films of this type too often the heroes are made out to be obnoxious jerks which ruins the humor they really are concerned for the safety of their missing friend for exampleminor flaws tyson isnt funny even when he mocks himself the asian stereotype seemed thrown in as if they felt they were obliged to do it for whatever reason it didnt add anything to the comedy which was already great in this filmis probably the best comedy of this type since animal house,comedy
there are so many different direction i could go here so here i goi remember seeing a billboard for this movie about a month before it came out and i thought fail now on friday of opening weekend i just blew everything off and figured what the hell the theater was packed which surprised me but it was easily one of the rare gems that comes out during the year most movies are overly hyped and consequently never live up to expectations but this movie hit on every cylinder its one of those movies that magically finds its way into o my dvd almost on a weekly basis the script was hilarious it was well shot but i have to give most of the credit to the actors the comedic timing enhanced the hilarity of the storyline ten foldi knew of bradley cooper from wedding crashers and he played a very similar role here hes the cool jocky guylikable even though hes a bit of a jerk he did a great job but the star of them all was obviously zack the guy steals every single scene i cant go much into detail its just something you have to experience easily my favorite comedy of at least the past 5 years,comedy
why did i went to watch this movie i never noticed when it was released  but slowly it started building at the box office  just like a stanley kubrik film and then it was just every where news papers talk shows and the marketing of this film in india was really good so thats how i was interested in this movie but again i felt that it would be another brainless hollywood sex comedyhighlighting point of the movie  though it was a comedy  it had more suspense as the film moved ahead that is the key point of this movie it is not a predictable storyno  not at all it was like idiana jones  solving the puzzle and moving ahead for the next clue and this continued till the last frame with rib tickling humorabout the director he has done a fine job in maintain the pace and suspenseperformances  1 zack is the star of this movie 2 ed helms is the second in the performance 3 ashley is the stylish and sexy 4 mike tyson and his tiger were awesome 5 the gay gangsta  keng jeong  superb  look out for his entry 6 the musicsummary  i am a reviewer who does not enter the story in my review if the film is good so  sorry  no clues just get ed after watching the ,comedy
i was at the movie theatre many a times this year and i have got to say that this movie was a great and fun time at the theatre although maybe that could have been because school had just got out for summer by far the funnest movie of the year as a comedy it was a perfect blend of dirtynasty jokes and fun adventure comedic adventure i might add the chemistry between cooper helms galifwhatever and bartha was beyond awesome and mike tyson too he was actually really good mr chow ken jeong holy crap mr chow was one hell of an annoying dude but he definitely made a perfect villain for the guys the only problem i found was that towards the end it did get rushed a bit i felt that they could have slowed it down and explained a it a little bit but this was the only problem i found the end credits were by far the greatest end credits in the history of movies i recommend this movie to everyone over the age of 14 as this movie is very dirty but if you are over 14 see this movie you will not regret it believe me i am always right,comedy
let me tell you i watched this movie after my little brother and sister so of course before i could watch it they kept telling me all the jokes so when i watched it i thought i had heard all the jokes boy was i wrong though it wasnt as funny because some jokes were ruined but there were plenty of jokes that i laughed out loud at this movie was funny thats all there is to it its funny you got the fat guy the nerd and the wise ass it follows the clichs but it still stays fresh ironically my favorite character was doug who was only in 14 of the movie but thats just because i love justin bartha can i say its the funnies comedy of all time no but it was the best of 2009 in the top five of the decade and top ten of all time its funny entertaining and puts a smile to your face,comedy
the takes a standard premise and turns it into a hilarious comedy that combines raunchy humor with whats going to be next mystery after the crazy bachelor party the three guys cant remember virtually anything about what actually has happened and where the groom can be this simple concept appears to be very productive and the team of screenwriters squeezes all the juice out of it providing plenty of laughoutloud scenes the humor not only stems from frequently absurd situations the guys come across but also their mostly hilarious interactions bradley cooper ed helms and zach galifianakis make for a great comedy trio playing characters of totally different personalities phil cooper is a party animal stu helms is a pragmatist and alan galifianakis seems to live in his own bizarre world they all bring different elements to the film galifianakis is especially hilarious delivering totally unhinged yet perfectly likable performance even though the is not sufficiently heartfelt or powerful to be a classic in my book it still delivers more than enough laughs by keeping the comic tension tight all the way through,comedy
after todd phillips rather disappointing debut in this genre of lowbrow comedy 2003s old school not many people would be expecting a lot from the how refreshing therefore that despite taking a tried and tested formula the manages to be consistently funny and emerges as a strong contender for the funniest film of the last few yearsfocusing upon husband to be doug justin bartha the film begins with his three best friends stu ed helms alan zach galifianakis and phil bradley cooperwaking up in vegas the morning after their friends stag night only to find there mate has gone missing what adds particular kudos to phillips film is that unlike most films in this genre we are spared the preamble of the drunken night itself and instead have no further clue than the characters themselves only piecing together the previous nights evidence as we go along finding a baby in the closet of there hotel room mike tysons tiger in the bathroom and one of the main characters missing a front tooth are just some of the bizarre clues we are given at the beginninganother problem with most films in this genre is you see the sixty second trailer laugh hysterically only to go and watch the film to find all the funny bits were within the trailer not so with the with the laughs coming thick and fast from mike tysons cameo to the guys finding a naked asian man in the trunk of there car the film really does have it all if i had to pick one thing that i think makes the film the success it is however it would be the chemistry between the main leads you really do care about the situations they find themselves in and that the ending is a happy one you have phil the alphamale stu the neurotic nerd who gets everything wrong and the hilariously weird bearded alan it is arguably galifianakis role as him that his the star role watch out for the hysterical moment when mike tyson knocks him out singing along to phil collins in conclusion this film is hilarious and also features one of the best credit sequences ever when the guys find a camera after dougs wedding that explains everything unanswered up to that point,comedy

great comedy cannot be seen every day on tv or maybe in cinema  they are very rare but now i believe that is real example that everything is so far from us  when you watch this movie you understand that comedies on tv are frivolous  this movie is really fun show and you cannot be calm during the watching the movie  almost every scene has got laughs and funny parts  doug and his company were so crazy that you may can think that they can ruin whole world  every comedy which you see after this will be maybe frivolous  stupid and monotone  before watching the movie that it will be childs play but it isnt  this movie is so good so funny and you will want to watch it again  i liked the most alan who is not such well known in the company but he was so cool and i liked the scene when he saw tiger and when mike tyson kicks him  every member of company was so daft and so funny that you wont believe that you are watching such good movie ,comedy
before seeing the i heard that it was about some guys who hold a bachelor party in las vegas i was expecting a night of ribaldry chronicling the bachelor party along the lines of superbadexcept with the characters being a bit older but the great thing about the is that all the action happens after the bachelor party occurs the next day its a tremendously clever idea where the comedy is in the unraveling of the mystery as to what happened to the protagonists during a bachelor party which they cannot recallin the act one setup were first introduced to the principals doug is about to be married and along with his brotherinlaw the offthewall alan joined by dougs buddies stu a dentist and phil an elementary school teacher decide to go to las vegas two days before the wedding for a surreptitious bachelor party we then cut to five hours before the wedding with phil making a desperate call to dougs fianc informing her that theyve lost doug and it looks like the wedding is off then we flashback to the revelers arrival at caesars palace in vegas where they go up to the hotel roof where loose cannon alan toasts doug by cutting himself with a knifehe invites everyone to join in a little blood letting as a sort of initiation rite but the others turn him down as they all think alan is a little bit off the wallthe break into act two occurs with alan stu and phil waking up in a trashed hotel room sans doug to make matters worse theres a live tiger in the bathroom a crying baby in the kitchen and stu the dentist is missing a tooth they go downstairs and give the parking valet a stub only to have him drive up with a police car with the valet addressing the bumbling threesome as officers and wishing them a good daysoon it becomes clear why alan stu and phil cant remember anything that happened the night before alan thought he was slipping a tab of ecstasy into their drinks but it turns out that it was rohypnol aka roofies a date rape drug which he bought from a confused drug dealer also named doug who later figures in the plot im not sure if i recall the exact sequence of what happens next but basically the three end up at a wedding chapel where they discover that the night before stu got hitched to a vegas stripper they locate her and fortunately shes the babys mother when the bumbling buddies return to their hotel room waiting for them there is mike tyson himself along with one of his handlers it seems that the boys stole tysons pet tiger and in a rather amusing scene drug the tiger and drive it back to big mikes mansion more outrageous obstacles soon are placed in the protagonists wayit seems that the night before alan was playing craps with a chinese gangster mr chow he ends up taking off with chows gambling winnings amounting to 80000 chow and his thugs confront alan stu and phil and reveal that they are holding doug and demand that they come up with his money or else theyll never see their buddy again in one of the few longwinded scenes in the film alan wins 80000 by employing card counting techniques while playing blackjack back at the casino they all drive out to the desert where they give chow the money but he hands over a black guy named doug who happens to be the drug dealer who sold alan the roofieswere back at the point where the flashback began toward the beginning of the film phil is calling dougs fianc informing her that doug cannot be located and the wedding is off but suddenly stu figures it all out earlier the guys had noticed that dougs mattress was impaled on the obelisk in front of the hotel he realizes that doug could not have thrown the mattress from the hotel windows since they dont openthe only conclusion is that they had brought doug up to the roof the night before and hes been stuck up there since nightfall alls well that ends well when the prospective groom and his three buddies drive back to los angeles just in time for the wedding in a hilarious scene while theyre driving on the highway they have their tuxedos thrown to them from a tuxedo company vanobviously having ordered the tuxes beforehand from the car using a cell phone and credit card the final scene is one of the bestthey discover a digital camera with all the pictures of the groups hijinx the night before they all agree to look at the pictures once and then erase all of them as the credits roll the pictures reveal the machinations of the bumbling threesome during their crazed night out on the townof all the characters i thought stu the dentist was the funniest we finally do find out how he lost that toothand the scene where he stands up to his overbearing girlfriend at the films climax was hilarious i expected a little more with alans character as he was introduced as to be the really crazy one at the beginningbut somehow i wanted him to do even more crazy things at the end kudos especially to ken jeong as mr chow the foulmouthed chinese gangster who was truly a hoot some of the jokes in the dont always hit the markthe bit about the police tasering the hapless trio in front of a bunch of schoolchildren just seemed a little too much nonetheless the has proved to be the sleeper hit comedy of 2009 with its one welcome bizarre situation after another,comedy
this movie has been done to death bachelor party bachelor party in vegas the groomsmen etc etc etc you know what  this film worked it did not pretend to be a deep movie with a script you had to graduate from an ivy league school to understand this was just a silly movie with silly antics and funny gags and predicaments there was a lot of originality in this film it was hilariously funny from start to finish fine acting and even finer screenplay one lost groom with his 3 knucklehead friends trying to piece together what happened this film was one of the funniest films of all time and well worth anyones time somehow mike tyson was worked into this film and even his couple of scenes were outstanding some supporting characters along the way most notably sexy heather graham and an even funnier chinese gentleman that stole a scene or 2 the from this one will be most pleasant,comedy
what happens when four guys go to vegas for a bachelors party good question phil bradley cooper stu ed helms alan zach galifianakis and doug justin bartha team up for a trip they will never remember mr chow ken jeong also adds to the unforgettable laughs on top of all that mike tyson makes an appearance better than other comedies such as old school anchorman or even wedding crashers the only thing i would recommend is not to let younger children watch this since theres a lot of cussing and sexual references all in all one of the funniest films of all time 910not sure how the sequel will play out,comedy
without any doubt this was definitely one of the funniest movies ive ever seen dont expect a cinematic masterpiece but if youre looking forward to an entertaining movie full of unpredictable jokes and situations this could be itthe tells the story of four guys who take off to las vegas for a bachelor party after a tough night they dont remember anything and above all is the groomtobe missing the other three men start reconstructing their passed night trying to find their lost friendthe extremely funny story is supported by wellknown and very entertaining music as well as by the impressive and beautiful scenery of nevada and the famous city of las vegas all of the mainly male characters play a superb and distinctive rolei recommend this comedy to everyone who hasnt laughed in a while enjoys american movies full of jokes and doesnt get offended by harsh language enjoy yourself,comedy
admittedly and perhaps obnoxiously im one of those who would normally never see a movie like this i havent really liked any of the other films by the director those ive bothered to see and im not a big fan of goofy drunken fratfare contemporary american comediesthank goodness my roommate downloaded this one and i could see it for free hey why not i had a free sunday morningi dont think either of us stopped laughing throughout the film ever which is especially surprising as even some of the funnier movies ive seen over the years tend to wane a bit toward the third act suddenly the plot really comes to the fore and the movie goes from being a comedy to being an actionpacked extravaganza or a drama or a romantic farce or whatever not this time you will continue to laugh without stop even through the credits thanks to a hilarious photo montagei was elated that such a movie could be made and that it could receive so much praise and commercial success i have found the apatow movies to be boring pointless longwinded and annoying at best and have been confused by their success thankfully there are still movies like the that show normal guys in fantastic situations and how they cope in a realistic matrix yes i just used the word matrixwithout being capitalizedin an imdb review of the and i also agree that although all of the actors in the film were topnotch even the bg guys who will fool you every time what a terrific casting job all around zach galfianakis sp is the farandaway mvp of this film i remember thinking from moment one goodness if he acts like this through the whole film the movie will already be a winner he does and it is and hes not the only gem of the picture kudos todd you finally made one thats truly hilarious surprisingly original there is a lot here you wont see in very bad things thoughtful wellstructured andyes ill say iteven intelligent keep it up we need more movies like the save us,comedy
i judge the quality of a film comedy by how much it makes me laugh i think i laughed exactly twice during the entire running time of the i was a willing subject i wanted to like this film after hearing the endless praise others have heaped on it i sat waiting for the jokes to land and waited and waitedi heard more than one person say that they never see movies but they saw this one and loved it that should have been my first warning that it wasnt going to be that good its jokes are so obvious and ordinary there are a bunch of stock characters  the fat schlubby guy the nerdy uptight guy the alpha male  and a bevy of tired jokes built around things like breast feeding and naked guysi guess i missed the memo that straight males are supposed to find the sight of another guys naked ass the most hilarious thing evergrade b,comedy
this is an original comedy with the oldest characters of the last 20 years in comedy movies the originality of this plot is in the way how the story is told and how each character has a role in it the story is based on a stag party in las vegas we have the fianc the crazy fiances brother the best fiancs friend and the fiancs friend who is already marriage ok until here there is a lot of movies with the same premise except by the way how the story will be told that is the differential of this movie and what makes it so cleaver and funnythe story starts after a crazy night which the spectators dont know what happened all the characters wake up and realize the fianc is missing and that no one have memories of the last nigh how will they discover what happened is the key of your entertainmenttrust me im sure you will laugh until the end of the movie as i am sure this movie is destiny to be a classic in american comedy,comedy
the was a movie that everyone hyped about to be one of the best comedies to come out in ages and i agree im very picky on comedies now a days because most of them turn out to be the same old stuff the takes raunchiness to the next level here i was amazed at how far they went past the line they even go as far as to joke about a baby jerking off what really makes the though is the likability of the 4 and the astounding chemistry they have each one of them is different but funny and likable in there own way i enjoyed the rain man spoof very much with phil and alan it was very funny and cute i also really enjoyed the las vegas scenery since it reminded me of my trip its also one of those movies that surprises you because despite the hype the trailer didnt look all that impressive to me there are so many unbelievably crazy moments here its insane if you like off the wall humor you will love the its raunchy its dirty and just plain fabulousperformances bradley cooper has shown the ability to be a great versatile actor i mean the guy is in everything now a days he is funny while remaining the cool sport of the bunch always wanting to have a blast ed helms is a hoot as the nervous wreck always worried about what his girlfriend will do if she finds out hes the nerd of the bunch but instantly likable and very funny himself zach galifianakis is insanely funny as alan hes clearly off his rocker but that is what makes him so funny justin bartha does not have as much screen time as the others but makes a big impact himself when he is heather graham is a favorite of mine due to her beauty and versatility here she is great fun while being a likable support jeffrey tambor is funny as alans dad ken jeong tested my patience once again he was funny in doses i suppose mike tyson is actually sporadically amusing with his screen time i was really surprised with his adequate performance i see potential in him rachael harris plays the funny yet nagging woman to a tbottom line the really does live up to most of the hype its one of the funniest movies i have seen in some time its raunchy its nasty and downright magnifique im all for the rumored sequel i cant wait to see what these guys do next highly recommended8 12 10,comedy
i was really reluctant in seeing this movie but am glad i viewed it it is ribcracking funny dougjustin bartha is getting married in two days so his best friends philbradley cooperand dentist stued helms decide to throw a bachelor party of shots strippers and debauchery in las vegas theres a problem before the trip even begins dougs future brotherinlaw alanzach gallfanekisdecides hes going to tag along and alan is wired on the freakish side the party boys wake up in their caesars palace villa with a hellofa not only are their heads addled but something is amiss stu has a tooth missing there is a tiger in the bathroom and a newborn baby in the closet oh yes doug is missingthere is no recollection of what happened before they passed out if they can piece things together they may be able to find the groomhilarious naughty sequences revelation of the nights events are outrageous if not interesting finding their missing pal is an adventure in itself and i found the wedding singer and his lyrics very inappropriate and kneeslapping funny you may need to watch a second time to glean all of the offcolor humor i found helms to be a downright hoot also in the cast heather graham ken jeong mike tyson jeffrey tambor and sasha barrese,comedy
so i decided to watch the on the internet today because ive heard many great reviews and claims that this movie is one of the funniest of 09 well i gotta agree i havent seen many movies in 09 but this was pretty funny although it honestly could have been funnier i didnt laugh all the way through the movie like others claim to say i laughed at many moments but i was expecting more the beginning was kind of weird but towards the middle and through the end it was hilarious and got good so much funny and weird things that normally wouldnt happen do happen so it starts with the four friends phil stu alan doug going to vegas to celebrate doug getting married then when there at vegas for a while they all witness the worst of their lives when they wake up they literally cant remember anythingthere is a tiger in the bathroom stu loses a tooth a baby in the closet and other weird things including them stealing a cop car mike tyson makes a funny cameo an accidental marriage and many more id highly recommend watching this film go rent it or watch it on the web like i didhers the link http wwwfree tv videoonlineinfoplayerzshare phpid71542802bf1e2d12 i had to space it out because it didnt allow the link in fullerase the spaces when copying the link in the url boxthanks as a rewatch 040518 and after over 8 years of rewatching in full opinions remain about the same the remains a great and entertaining watch knowing the twist ending made it less appealing but on a rewatch was more understood and picked up clues and hints had not noticed in original viewing as another rewatch 053019 the remains one of the rare comedies which has stood the test of time,comedy

the is a fun movie its consistently entertaining even when a few of its jokes fall flat the plot is predictable the characters are familiar and the film says nothing still it works as an enjoyable movie to sit down to after a long daythe plot is simple doug is getting married so his two best friends and brotherinlawtobe take him to las vegas for a weekend of hard liquor strippers and gambling things escalate quickly when phil and stu dougs friends wake up in their hotel room with dougs brotherinlaw a tiger a baby and an assortment of random odds and ends the only thing missing is dougthe tells the story of the mens quest for doug they need to find and recover him before the time of his wedding the plot doesnt matter all that much its more of an excuse to put in an endless flow of gags fortunately the gags work and so does the movie it never tries to be poignant or pc and it has a bunch of laughoutloud moments accusations of racism sexism and homophobia seem a little outofplace all three issues are treated in intentionally absurd fashionall three of the main actors give good comedic performances and the script clips along smoothly this is not a great movie but it doesnt try to be,comedy
the is an enjoyable laugh out loud movie that will go down as one of the better comedies to come out of hollywood in recent years there isnt much needed in terms of plot as four friends head to vegas for a stag party and subsequently wake up the morning after with only strange mementos of the night before to leave them wondering what they did the fact that the clues include a real life tiger in their bathroom and a baby in the cupboard only add to the intrigue cue a series of set pieces and some glittering one liners and its easy to see why this film was a big hit on both sides of the atlantic anyone that has suffered the agony of not knowing what happened the night before and then the acute embarrassment when you gradually realise just what you did will identify with this movie and watch out too for a great turn from heather graham and a hilarious appearance by mike tyson  yes the mike tyson,comedy
if you like these fast paced sarcastic and well acted movies this is the one for you i am a big fan of zach galifianakis seriously this guy is a wonderful actor not to take anything from the rest of the cast i will go see anything he because he just deliversgreat cinematography excellent guest appearances roster but specifically the characters are so greatly combined in the story line with personal development stories and unique personalities that just workwhat else can i tell u honestly its best not to know much just go watch it and get ready for some fun laugh and a lot of  holly st i cannot believe i just saw thisit most definitely enters the classic cult ones like out coldwe want more,comedy
the is arguably the top comedy of 2009 the film defied expectations to rake in millions of dollars on its way to becoming one of the highest grossing rrated films of all time it even managed to snag a golden globe nomination recentlyhowever while i wouldnt argue against the enjoyability of the i find that in retrospect the films individual components seem pretty average yet somehow the film manages to become more than the sum of its partsthe script is funny but not hilarious similarly the actors bringing the script to life are competent but mostly seem to be the budget versions of more recognizable and talented actorsthe storyline keeps us interested due to its unpredictable nature but theres nothing that really ties any of it together in a clever way this doesnt really become apparent until we reach the end and see that everything that preceded it was fairly arbitrarythe presentation is good enough with the direction servicing the story and the soundtrack supporting the vibe but theres nothing truly outstanding there eitherin short this is a movie that somehow produces a winning combination from commonplace elements in the end im doubtful about how the movie will hold up to repeated viewings but it is undeniably enjoyable the first time around,comedy
parties people getting drunk embarrassing moments all classic components of american comedy all done to death and yet the managed to become one of the big hits of summer 2009 with some critics and viewers even praising it as the funniest movie in years while that definition is entirely arbitrary and used a bit too often it is true that todd phillips latest achievement manages the near impossible to take an overly familiar topic and turn it into an unpredictable hilarious ridewhats it all about then well theres a guy named doug justin bartha whos getting married and as per american comedy tradition his friends want to make sure his last days of freedom are spent in the best way hence a trip to vegas  where else  in the company of funloving school teacher phil bradley cooper uptight dentist stu ed helms aka andy from the us version of the office and the brides weird brother alan standup comedian zach galifianakis all prepared for a night of fun they will never forget until the next morning that is the hotel room is a mess stus missing a tooth theres a tiger in the bathroom and someone left a baby in the closet oh yeah and doug has disappearedfrom there on the turns into a comedic whodunit with the guys trying to retrace their steps so that the wedding can actually happen cue encounters with the police ouch a stripper heather graham on top form a naked chinese gangster ken jeong and mike tyson all this is handled expertly by phillips working from a script by jon lucas and scott moore the writers of four christmases dont ask that brings him back to the more juvenile territory of road trip and old school after the bigscreen revisit of strasky  hutch the difference is this time greater care has been put into the writing with a great combination of clever plot structure and endearing characterizations sure the three leads are essentially comedy types especially alan who at times channels john belushi but they manage to remain real believable and most importantly relatablenevertheless there are a few minor defects that prevent the movie from being the outright comedic masterpiece some claim it to be for one thing its very much a guy movie with the female characters including graham reduced to sceneryfilling beauties or as in the case of stus sweetheart annoyances also the film doesnt really go all the way with the madness opting for a safe hollow finalreel solution instead of the truly dark and insane material the premise  and the rrating  could and would have allowed think scorseses after hours with more sex jokesbut hey why complain when most of the film is absolutely hilarious the cooperhelmsgalifianakis trio is a genuinely adorable bunch of losers and phillips elicits laughs with all kinds of humor both verbal what happens in vegas stays in vegas except herpes and physical all the bits with the tiger andor the baby by subverting some clichs  much like reservoir dogs was a heist movie without the actual heist this film deals with the aftermath of a night we never see  and indulging others hes funny because hes fat one character says of alan and hes got a point throw in a bunch of funny references star treks im a doctor gag is used brilliantly and one of those absolute rarities in recent comedies ie closing credits that arent skippable and youve got one hell of a fun funny movie,comedy
another nerds comedy another bachelor party in las vegas movieyes but there are several laugh out loud moments which carry you over the gross or unfunny draggy parts  and not many comedies of recent times can say that the set up is different  a conceit that you are looking at the present as three guys try and remember  in time  where the misplaced groom is having taken rufies by mistake and being unable to recall a thing about a bachelor party that went completely out of line the acting is not smug or egotistical eg not like those endlessly unfunny ferrell rogen etc movies the plot does not go too far out of reality and the minor characters are not star vehicles for a drop in bit part it rolls along but some bits do not work  cue overplayed gay chinaman grotesque joke about masturbation with a baby and leads to a happy ending all round heather graham as a stripper is not given enough to do  did we see more in the cinema because i saw this on a sanitised virgin aeroplane but at 277m gross for an rrated movie you have to see it,comedy
this movie is certainly aptly titled essentially it tells the story of four buddies who head out to las vegas for a couple of days for a bachelor party because one of them is about to get married and then have to spend the second day figuring out what they did on the first day because they got so totally wasted that they cant remember one of them the groom has disappeared one got married to a stripper one ended up in the hospital and one found a tiger in their hotel bathroom it was quite a weekendtheres no doubt that it is funny at times the scene where mr chow jumps totally naked out of the trunk of their car had me in stitches having said that it was also rather crude much of the time and sometimes came across as very much similar to a sophomorictype comedy which i dont think its intended to be it seems more inclined to be going for a more mature audience but for me at least too many of the characters and situations just came across as ridiculously implausible rather than funny the first twenty minutes or so i found especially difficult to get through as it takes that long for anything even remotely funny to begin to happen and the same can be said for the last few scenes although i did appreciate the moment when stu the guy who married the stripper finally kicked his obsessively controlling girlfriend out of his life its not a disastrous movie and  yes  it is quite funny at times just not enough of the time 410,comedy
if you are looking for a laugh this movie is awesome it is not an i was laughing so hard i peed my pants type of movie but it is definitely a great comedy the movie starts with phil one of the four guys calling the bride to be and telling her that they cant find the groom so you basically know what has happened right from the start and it is not difficult to guess how the movie is going to end but all the crazy and unexpected things that happened to them like for instance finding a tiger in the bathroom evens it up a bit like many other comedies it is slightly trite for instance the nerdy guy always turns out to be kind of wild and the stupid moron conveniently turns out to be smart but even though it is predictable it is very funny and i strongly recommend you to see it because it is awfully entertaining,comedy
an engaging premise what did we do the night before why is the groom missing why is there a lion in the bathroom and a baby in the closet this bizarre setup has you hooked please be advised and if this is possible see this without any notion of the antics or reviews thus far as it will probably be that much more funny the unravels events in a logical creative and humorous manner all the cast are very good but zach galifianakis as alan is the standout character with the best linesi loved the soundtrack to with ushers yeah tis live your life and kanye wests cant tell me nothing synced into the film early on that is not forgetting the original songs stus song and three best friends which were worth a chuckle not to mention mike tysons cameo how did that happen the is a comedy of originality and eccentric characters and there are plenty of laughs to be had and i recommend the to anyone wanting a good giggle,comedy
the majority of the last decade of film comedy has given us american pie ripoffs and judd apatow ripoffs so its refreshing to see todd phillips return to a situational comedy with great relationships and great dialogue the is a hard r rating but i was never overwhelmed with that allwehaveforyouisgrossoutmaterial feeling that other more desperate films resort to the confidence of the acting and direction in the is easy to tag along with and the ride is worth it the story doesnt seem like anything new  four guys go to vegas for a bachelor party and things go horribly horribly wrong the quartet wakes up the morning after to find they cant remember what happened and the state of their hotel room is chaoticthe biggest enjoyment of this film is watching reveal after reveal as the guys discover just what mayhem their night consisted of and the rabbit hole gets deeper and deeper as the plot unfolds and the movie gets funnier and funnier this film is a great starring vehicle for perennial supporting actor bradley cooper whose turns in wedding crashers and failure to launch first got him noticed in the movies the other main members of the crew are ed helms so funny on the office and zach galifinakis funny in comic circles for years finally getting his due in a big movie its a great casting turn to use these guys cause the scenes dont get dominated by the routine antics youd expect from someone like will ferrell adam sandler and even seth rogen to a point every lead guy in this film is a wild card and thats a huge asset to the moviebromance seems to be the theme to many of todays comedies and despite a malecentric story the avoids lapsing into forced sentimentality and as a result finds more time for more laughs especially hilarious is the security cam footage from mike tysons house and a visit to the wedding chapel where a particularly drunken event occurred the night before the mike tyson cameo is hit and miss it seems like the filmmakers wanted to exploit his eccentricity having him sing along with a phil collins song but he works best as a straight man to the madness of the partygoersmaybe tyson shouldve been more imposing cause if i had one storyline issue it was the lack of really threatening characters that would add a whole new level to the mystery of what happened the night before two police officers question the boys but their relationship soon devolves into snltype characters and the guys first runin with asian gangsters is hilarious in that whathavetheygottenthemselvesinto kind of way but its disappointing to learn that their boss despite a hilarious entrance is more cartoonish than intimidating watching our heroes squirm out from under a more ominous gangster mightve been a more compelling choicethose are minor issues with an otherwise funnierthanhell movie that has dialogue i wish i spoke and characters i wish i knewfor one nightspoiler talk im curious what women think of the result of all the debauchery in the in the end the guys get away with everything they dont get scolded for their actions the one stripper they meet has a heart of gold the bitch of the story gets tossed to the curb they make the wedding everything seems to go right for me a guy watching this its a cathartic tale of scruffy heroism but what does a female think should the boys have any comeuppance,comedy

a great movie good comedy with fun and laughter with drugs and dough with obscenity and perversion with a light and harmless storyline a great mixture of fear and loathing in las vegas and some guy richie imitation expect no deep emotions no love line its a film to watch with friends and beerthe story is strong with a retrograde mapping of the happenings but has nothing new to say neither has this way of decoding the confusion some newish style it is a simply watchable movie with a dont expect a kaboom at the end ending once is enoughwhat really impresses is the cut and rhythm of the movie it is well balanced no real slopes and hills just evenly tense till the endthere is one scene that had some sort of introducing function a nice idea after drinking jgermeister and forgetting the whole bloodbrotherhood crap from brother alan they raise their glasses to cheers than the camera swings on to the vegas horizon showing the accelerated dawn behind the skyline lets the story begin harmonic few secondsthe characters especially alan are lovable not to mention here that the actors appeared until now in lowbudget somehow neglected films which gives some extra taste and virginity to the film and the evolution of the characterssummarized up i can only tell you watch this film its worth but keep in mind this wont alter the ways of moviemaking in the futureat least in my opinion enjoy,comedy
i almost gave this movie a 10 but comedies are hard to do and there are some slight imperfections the characters were not really well defined before the fun starts it might have been a little more interesting if wed known more about the groom and the best man who i guess was a bad teacher who doesnt like kids not sure anyway thats not what this movie is about in short i loved this movie my wife and i laughed our heads off it has a great ear for the way people talk and the oneliners fit well into the story and connect with the personalities of the characters i love the way it starts the morning after hence the title and the characters have to piece back together what happened i guarantee this you have never before been so compelled to stay seated for the closing credits as you will be for this movie i wont say why i laughed hard from start to finish and very strongly recommend this comedy to anybody who has just once understood what it was like to party just a little bit too hard,comedy
i thought the trailers were fairly accurate as far as what to expect in this movie as it did have good laughs and funny dialog and wacky characters that gave the viewer a worthy joyride from a blur of odd elements that setup a cute and fun punchline to a strange night of zany occurrences in which 4 very different and likable male boobs happen to experience in the land of las vegasthere are send ups on rain man  three men and a baby and so on mixed in with the plot tension of the missing guy friend after an awesome night of fun that the remaining 3 parters cant seem to rememberthe writer does a great job of taking us thru a fun ride of intrigue and laughter on the way to finding a friend and maybe finding new spirits within each of the characters that will not only make this movie worth the price of the ticket but will launch the careers of several of the actors into the stratosphere  no pay for this plug right and parlay the box office success to a delightful return in the part 2 hope you dont bring any kids below 17 or 16 yrs old to this movie however unless you want to expose them to some racy pics that outraged the nuns at the theater i went to  enjoy at least 1000 smiles if you dont laugh out loud several times watching this movie as it is very cute at the least for those viewers who just think or act like laughter is too difficult an undertaking for themeven the tightest of humor grinches out there will have to bust out  relax and give a fat bunch of chuckles to the      ,comedy
the is a funny grown up version of dude wheres my car without the bubble wrap or the space men or the chinese fast food drive in or that guy from that 70s show its fear and loathing in las vegas except there is a plot instead of johnny depp and theyve taken drugs unknowingly its pinapple express but with roofies instead of marijuana and there is a wedding crashers ending instead of a john woo shoot out its the big lebowski if you took all the chinatown elements out of it and just made a movie about intoxicated people running around trying to figure out what happened its pretty funny ill give you that,comedy
the is boorish vulgar brash crude offensive twisted politically incorrect and it is unexpectedly and often sidesplittingly funny and one of the best comedies to come out of hollywood in a long timeheres the thing about todd phillips movie it has no pretensions about what it is phillips directorial credits include road trip 2000 old school 2003 starsky  hutch 2004 and school for scoundrels 2006 but this is clearly his best and most consistently funny moviewho gets the credit for this film working phillips or screenwriters jon lucas and scott moore who lets face it didnt exactly hit home runs with four christmases 2008 or ghost of girlfriends past 2009 what are the chances they happened to strike gold with this one and much has been written about how phillips rewrote the script for the how much of that is apocryphal is unknownwhat makes the work  other than a welcome change of not seeing will ferrell  is the cast of relative unknowns weve seen them in movies before but they tend to fall more into the category of that guy than anything else its unlikely they remain unknown given how hugely successful this film isbut no one in this cast  at least among the main leads  is hamming for the camera or acting as if they know what they are doing is funny the trick here is that bradley cooper ed helms and zach galifianakis play much of it dead pan taking the situation they find themselves in very seriously there is a reason why we find frank drebin of the naked gun films so funny because leslie nielsen plays all his lines straightthats exactly what cooper helms and galiafianakis do compare what they do to what ferrell did in say old school and youll see what i mean just watch how galifianakis treats a line about the holocaust or what condiments tigers like they are both good lines but what makes them very funny is that he says them so matteroffactlyi have been a fan of galifianakis for years his standup routines are awfully funny and most recently i have discovered his between two ferns online talk show that is funnier in two minutes than most 30minute tv sitcoms if you havent seen between two ferns do yourself a favor and seek it out online in fact that show is a fine example of how to do comedy well talk about playing it straightthe should rightfully make galifianakis a soughtout figure as popular as seth rogen except hes a better actor and more tolerable than rogen galifianakis deserves all the success this film should bring him he brings a certain naivet to his role of alan garner the brides brother he isnt shy but theres a sweet charm to him that makes him awfully endearingwhen the stumbles it is because supporting actors ken jeong and rob riggle play their roles for laughs overacting and trying too hard to sell their jokes the story bogs down when it gets too wrapped up in exposition a needless sequence involving jeongs mr chow too bad because his introduction is absolutely hysterical and the writers could have included the expositionary stuff right there when we first meet mr chow the bit with riggle seems unnecessary and too forced his shtick works in sketches on the daily show with jon stewart but here it falls flatfrankly i was pleasantly surprised that i so enjoyed the the concept of bachelors heading off to vegas for a bachelor party replete with strippers is so tired that i thoroughly expected another routine boyswillbeboys movie but phillips wisely never shows us the revelry the boys got into instead what we see is the aftermath as the guys try to reconstruct the previous nights eventsmuch is left to our imagination as the guys try to solve a mystery they find clues some more enticing than the other some more revelatory than the others along the way they meet a physician mike tyson and a hooker heather graham who is more than a mere hooker with a good heart  she wants to meet mr right its lovely to see graham in a movie like this though she isnt given much to do she deserves to be in a hit film considering some of the junk she has done for the past few years truly clunkers such as cake 2005 gray matters 2006 and miss conception 2008 do not do this woman justice give her good material and she shines her toobrief appearance on the tv show scrubs proves that i hope she shows up more in the 2the humor is often rude coarse and can be offensive but the thing about phillips movie is the humor  visual and verbal  is grounded in character we care about alan stu and phil and what happens to them as they try to find their buddy doug we root for them because despite their boorishness their characters have heartthe is funny from the very beginning it stumbles occasionally especially in the third act when some of the lesser characters try too hard but those are forgivable sins considering how hilarious the rest of the movie ishowever if you are one of those people who frowns at lowbrow humor  and some of the stoops low  or is easily offended by myriad foul jokes then might i suggest you skip this film and go see say my life in ruins a wholly insipid movie brimming with thoroughly inoffensive milquetoast charactersbut if you enjoy genuinely funny movies that earn their r rating because they go for broke with their jokes then i heartily recommend the i might be hardpressed to see a funnier film this year,comedy
when i first saw the trailer my friends and i decide to watch the movie this has to be one of the funniest movies ive seen in a long time for anyone who is prudish and cant tell by what the movie is rated or by the title of the movie dont see for anyone who has a sense of humor you have to see this moviefunnier than old school wedding crashers 40 year old virgin knocked up and superbad put together  maybe im laying it on a little bit i was not at all expecting it to be this funny go see it its worth the money and omg i still can believe how hot is bradley cooper even in a movie like that he was so funny and handsome like always the whole movie i went was for him finally its an hilarious movie  u cant miss this movie,comedy
todd phillips the writerdirector of road trip old school and starsky  hutch brings us another rowdy trip through manhood with the we follow doug justin bartha his best friends phil bradley cooper and stu ed helms as well as alan zach galifianakis dougs future brother inlaw who plan on making dougs bachelor party one to remember its certainly memorable but not the night itselfthe morning after phil stu and alan find themselves back in their hotel suite with very little clothing a chicken a baby a missing tooth and no doug oh and their is a tiger in the bathroom the three set out in search for the missing groom who has a day to be back in la in less than two days for his wedding they take the baby shake off their s and hit the strip looking for clues that lead them to the hospital a wedding chapel and mike tysons housethe story is as ridiculous as it sounds but i was still completely engrossed in what was going on i couldnt believe how messed up their night was yet i was completely focused on what would happen next its the kind of film where from the start you just accept that crazy things are going to happen and you just enjoy the ridethe three leads cooper helms and galifianakis could not have been better choices cooper has the looks and charisma to handle his too cool character helms more commonly known as andy bernard on nbcs the office is perfect as the nice guy with a mean streak and missing tooth galifianakis could not have made me laugh any more than i did his looks alone let you know you cant take him seriously he is pudgy childish and completely engrossed in his character unlike some filmmakers who make similar films phillips has not fallen off his game he didnt get lazy and go through the motions each scene each line and each set up follow through in their delivery and add to the flow of the film there were times when the action might get a little too serious but he brings us back from reality and throws a one liner or situation you cant help but laugh at its so enjoyablei really didnt know what to expect coming into this film and i sure am pleased with the results i didnt anticipate liking the as much as i did and it is probably going to be one of the best films i will see this summer if you are of age and are in need of a good laugh go see this i take that back if you are of age go see it anyways its worth the price of admission and then some,comedy
dont get me wrong the entertained me and didnt bore me at all but to see this movie in the top 250 and to hear all these rave reviews its been getting doesnt make any senseit honestly wasnt really that funny if youve seen the trailer youve seen the majority of the funny moments i chuckled but this movie was definitely not laughoutloud throughout materiali guess what kind of turned me off of the movie was the charactersi was very wishywashy on who i did and didnt like throughout the film i also felt that some of allens random and bizarre outbursts were unneeded and he closely reminded me of steve carrels brick from anchormanbeside these gripes the film was alright a good summer movie but i would probably not see it again and i wouldnt pay more than 899 for this movie but dont take this review to heart go watch this and form your own opinions,comedy
like sex and the city last summer was a film for women who acted stupid and vulgar who dredged up the most moronic and insipid aspects of american culture this is its spiritual twin the movie of the summer the comedy that will make 300 million dollars that morons will be quoting over and over even though the lines were not clever or quotable the film is one five minute joke stretched out for what seems to be an eternity i saw this today and spent 20 bucks including food on this piece of garbage two hours of my life gone forever if only i was as lucky as the characters in the film and could have forgotten the entire thing what happens when you see the stays with the that would be great i actually left the theater hoping i didnt see anyone i knew as i was walking out because i was so embarrassed to have sat through the entire film all in all this movie was no where near as good as the book boring as hell lame stupid embarrassing it will make 300 million dollars this summer,comedy
this movie is for anyone with an iq under about 85 or so ridiculous and stupid and not funny,comedy
the is a great example of what the former frat boys from animal house do the rest of their lives just simply more of the samei have no doubt that these four would have been members in good standing right along with blutarsky otter and the rest bradley cooper zack galifianakis ed helms and justin bartha decide on the way to barthas wedding in los angeles to have the ultimate in bachelor parties with a night in the sin city of the west las vegasit was one hell of a party somebody slipped our merry men the date rape drug and they have absolutely no idea where theyve been or what theyve done worse than that theyve got a baby in a closet and a tiger in the loo but even worse than that barthas been misplaced and they havent the foggiest idea where to start looking for himif youre taste runs to animal house and police academy like comedies than the is definitely your cup of tea,comedy
i cant figure out if reviews and ratings of this movie are plain marketing or am i getting too old most original comedy of year and so on and so on my ass story is is simple as it gets four guys go to vegas get drunk and stoned which makes them really cool and one of them even marries a stripper and thats about it yeah people far out this must be hundredandsomething movie of all times since i have seen few recommendations before watching it i kept waiting for the moment it would really start being really good regrettably it goes mostly down from the tiger on well movie is not completely bad and can make make a fun evening out with your preferably male friends preferably after a beer or two in normal circumstances i would give it 6 or 7 but since a have to balance a little for all that nonsense it gets five from me,comedy

a negative rating if there were such a thing would be too much praise for this abomination but i digress i apparently never once saw the cue card guy with the laugh sign walking back and forth at the bottom of the screen because i dont remember knowing when to laugh or even chuckle once during this trainwreck maybe the film producers need to work on making that cue card guy a lot biggerthat this piece of excrement and even that is too complimentary for this concoction of matter is rated so highly on imdb just reinforces so much of what is wrong with this planet today the fact that this detritus ranks even in the same solar system as shawshank redemption the godfather any part schindlers list 12 angry men the original of course the good the bad and the ugly lawrence of arabia even guardians of the freakin galaxy speaks volumes as to how far we as a race have sunk im ready for the ele to hit reset so we can start over again maybe the cockroaches can do better next go round,comedy
when i first came into contact with this film i wasnt too sure what to expect not being a film expert the names in the film meant nothing to me well put it this way they do now the best actor without a doubt is zach galifianakis through the entire film his untamed wit and extemporaneous humour will always at least give you a giggle even though it has been a while since i have seen this film the memories of first seeing it five years ago still seem fresh which to me is the mark of a good moviethere is just the right balance of each character and their individual persona so you like  hate them all equally firstly there is phil bradley cooper who is an average guy with a wild side and a certain likable nonchalant attitude towards situations of peril then stu ed helms who is the most nervous and least willing to be outgoing termed the sensible one then alan zach galifianakis who is the child of the bunch one cannot say he is outgoing as he doesnt intend to be this can also be applied to his humorous comments here i feel to illustrate this it is obligatory for me to make reference to a scene where the three protagonists are shot with tasers police in which he laughs and claps when a young child shots phil with said taserto end i can easily say i would happily watch this movie again now despite the fact that ive seen it twice already,comedy
the is the first movie of the the franchise and a comedy about three people  phil wenneck stu price and alan garner  all of whom travel to las vegas to celebrate their friend doug billings bachelor partyhoweverthe party turns out to be race against time when the three groomsmen awaken after a night of heavy drinking to find out that their friend doug has gone missing and they must find the groom to get him into the altar just in time for his weddingthings become extremely difficult as all three have no recollection whatsoever of the the events that happened the night beforeit stars bradley cooper ed helms zach galifianakis heather graham justin bartha and jeffrey tambor it was coproduced and directed by todd phillips no question that this is one comedic film that many people have wished forit is definitely extremely funny as it presents brilliant humorthe viewer will probably have tears laughing while watching itone reason for it is the fact that it has a clever script and the chemistry and exchange of dialogues between the major characters was definitely greatone will definitely have a great time watching it,comedy
2009s the launched the careers of bradley cooper ed helms zach galifinakis and justin bartha as well and revamping the career of comedy director todd phillips the four stars did star in several things before this but where always pushed in the back and not very recognized unless youve seen the movies many times todd phillips did other classic comedies in the past such as road trip and old school but not a lot of good ones after old school i remember watching the trailer for this bout three times and knowing that it would be one of those typical nowadays dumb comedies i actually thought this would be worse because of the lack of wellknown stars when i went to the theatres to watch it for something to do the became one of my favourite comedies ever and one of my favourite movies in general i was not expecting such a great flick at allthe follows doug justin bartha who is just about to get married and goes to have a bachelor party in las vegasfor the night with his two best friends cooper helms and soonto be brotherinlaw alan galifinakis by morning doug is missing the three boys cant remember anything and see things they did that are best kept in vegas when doug is found it is a major surprise at first after many watches dougs whereabouts become very predicable but the laughs stay the samei remember watching this and thinking this was similar to dude wheres my car in that two dudes search for their car with no memory and danger headed their way in this three friends search for their groom with no memory and danger coming their way but this is more serious since dude was part scifisince its release the has become the benchmark and measuring stick of rrated comedies because if im not mistaken the is the biggest rrated comedy ever macgruber hot tub time machine and were the millers have all been compared in some form or another to the i thought it was much better than macgruber a bit better than hot tub and as good as millers the may last as comedys big benchmark until theres another sleeper hitwhat really makes this is the four main guys phil cooper is a prepschool teacher who is the coolest guy of the group stu helms is a geeky dentist and in great possession of his girlfriend alan is a stupid and highly immature manchild who grows attached his new friends doug has the least amount of screen time but is pretty awesome when he is on screen the chemistry and development is what makes these guys so cool other known stars include heather graham jeffrey tambor and mike tyson who make the movie even better44,comedy
in the opening scene the the big day has arrived with elvis lyrics in the background the cinematography pans over the preparations for the couples nuptials that include all the trappings for the making of a white wedding in a nonlinear fashion montage this story moves back and forth to reconstruct the boys bachelor party night the day after clues include a baby and tiger mixed in with the champ mike tyson and stripper jade heather graham now it is simply connecting the dots so goes the mystery tale of the groom doug justin bartha who is hosted on the ritualistic night to las vegas by his brother in law alan zach galifianaki and best friends phil bradley cooper and stu ed helms a true adventure heist that will remind you that what happens in vegas stays in vegas unless you want to remember then have someone keep notes or take good pictures the is the perfect way to start either boys or girls night out in the city,comedy
i have to give this movie a 10 out of 10 best so good comedy lmao i loved the music in the movie good songs and makes me want to dance and party like the 4 guys so much badass someday i will go to vegas or at least usathe movie is very funny and the best part is when movie ends and those credits with the photos come on screen i dont have anything bad to say really good movie definitely check the movie out very funny and nice comedy bradley cooper was thy beast so good actor and nice mix of seriousness and fun and the length is enough not too long not too short,comedy
unbelievably funny every single time i watch this i laugh so hard it has so many great one liners it is very easy to re watch i watched it 3 times in the week i first saw it and have watched it again recently its acting is not great but it isnt bad as the actors set out to do what they are meant to this is the type of comedy i love todd phillips is a good director other than this old school all of it is just awesome zach galiafinakis brings this movie to what it is my second favorite movie of all time its a shame about the crappy second one but even though that was a copy of this one i would rather watch this exact copy of that kind of copy any day,comedy
this was the biggest comedy for 2009 and for the most part it deserves all the hype it got it was ballsy and had some hysterical moments and kept me entertained and amused all the way through this comedy was such a big hit that it even made few of the actors in this get more roles and stand out even more in other movies they will be featured in later especially bradley cooper and zach galifianakis also even ken jeong zach galifianakis on the other hand tries a bit too hard after this flick though he was good in this movie though to sum it up this movie is a instant classic comedy that will be remembered for a while even after you finish watching this movie had just about all the right comedic element to the point its most definitely worth seeing if you like comedies yes some of the jokes might be a bit crude for some audiences but arent all comedies now a days trying to push the bar i personally liked the shock factor in this this movie is a 8610 for me8610,comedy
because ive never drank alcohol a day in my life or dont know what its like to be a drunk i didnt think this movie would appeal to me at least in terms of entertainment i was pleasantly surprised by how much i liked it i cant say there are any big laughs but i smiled a lot and didnt feel like i was enduring these characters rather than enjoying what they were doing i do think a lot of critics are gave this movie too much credit i cant see how this is great rather than merely good another thing the night before the these guys sure dont do a lot of drinking im thinking to myself small glasses thats it i expected to see something more along the lines of say a lot of drinking at some party still the movie never lets up and thats enough to recommend it out of ,comedy
so this is my review of the my older brothers and i had been wanting to see this movie ever seen it came out in 2009 two years ago but my oldest 17 year old brother still hadnt seen this went with a friend to see part 2 he liked it a whole lot and kept talking about it so about a month later it was very rainy outside so we did nothing but watch the tv we were going through the guide and the first was going to come on in about an hour on cinemax my brothers and i still had not seen it we were so excited the movie wouldnt be half as good without alan chow or mike tyson the nerdy hillbilly stu was a little funny but alan is hilarious i think phil is just cool but i am not allowed to see part 2 until it comes on dvd but i asked my brother which was better he says theyre about the same the imdb rating is 7910 i have read a lot the user reviews and it looks like the rating should be 66 the part 2 has a present rating of 69 but that could change because it is still in theaters and there are stills more reviews to come because of the user reviews so far looks like it should be 5910 well thats my opinion of the awardwinning ,comedy
thought this was just another guys film i didnt know i would like it that much the movie gives out interwoven surprises and laughter all the most impossible things happened in so many ridiculous ways and when you look back also so reasonableyeah its vegasthe story is told in a very clever way hurry with the guys to be shocked by what had happened the night before witness the faces of how could ihe have done that rediscover the romantic accident tumble into unexpected meetings experience dangers and embrace the happen endings i also like the way those characters interacted in the movie sometimes they got very angry sometimes they were obsessed with crazy ideas just what i thought most people would do in vegas but sooner or later some of them would get the better judgment try to cope and to make their way outfinally this is not a movie just for guys,comedy
in a sea of comedies that are absolutely humorless idiotic and ones that only have their moments every hour the stands out as a fresh piece of the modern day world of comedy obtaining the top three status for most successful r rated films this film reminds us that with the right mix of characters a cute story and some highly eventful antics comedy films can still be made like they used to beits the day before dougs bartha big wedding and before making a lifelong commitment his friends phil cooper stu helms and alan galifianakis the soon to be brotherinlaw of doug take him out on a bachelor party in vegas they toast on the roof and next thing they know they wake up hungover their room destroyed a tiger and a chicken in the livingroom and they must figure out what the hell happened last night the best part is they lost the groom so phil stu and alan must search the entire las vegas for doug while piecing together the events of the previous nightthe true fun of the is the fact that the fun comes from the events in the film the characters try desperately to find their friend but so many unexplainable events keep popping up and interfering with their plans its hystericalyou can tell when a comedy is trying to hard to squeeze laughs out of its audience some work some dont with the the first time you see it you will laugh a lot its consistently funny there is never a dull moment all four actors have great chemistry and we wind up actually caring about their fates not just watching them unfold with no emotionit plays like a hazy detective story where we know only as much as the characters normally in movies we get a side story of others or the movie will give you hints to what will happen in the we go from their final moments alert to when they wake up in their hotel room we know nothing of the events last night we have to wait for them to uncover the eventsthe character that delivers the most laughs is easily zach galifianakiss character sweet and simple alan has tons of quotable lines that are maybe far too quotable the will most likely do to galifianakiss career what animal house did to john belushis he has now became a household name and will likely be compared to his role in the if he does future comedies hopefully hell do one very serious drama film to show he is multitalented rather than being the charming simpleton in all his moviesbecause of all the buzz the was dubbed overrated and not funny by many who saw it late i saw the film around the time of release hearing nothing about it and just getting out of school i was in for a positive movie i just expected a few good laughs and all around a decent movie what i got was a wonderful comedy with heart humor and a huge rewatch valuestarring ed helms bradley cooper zach galifianakis and justin bartha directed by todd phillips,comedy

 this review may include spoilers the is a film about three friends and a brotherinlaw that go on an overnight trip to las vegas phil wennick bradley cooper stu price ed helms and alan garner zach galifianakis take the doug billings justin bartha to las vegas for his last fling before he gets married however stu phil and alan wake up the following day in their hotel suite and cannot remember any of the events from the night before to make things worse doug cannot be found and so they spend the rest of the film trying to recreate what happened the night before with the hope of finding their friend dougthe theme of this movie is about loyalty to your friends sticking together and taking care of each other during stressful times this theme resonates throughout the entire film specifically the plot is about stu phil and alan recreating the events that occurred during the previous night in order to recover doug they could have easily given up however all four arrived together and they were going to leave togetherwhether it was returning mike tysons tiger paying mr chows 80000 ransom for doug or submitting to being stun gunned at the police precinct stu phil and alan did whatever it took to locate doug they were not going to return home without himirony was illustrated throughout the film alans irony of character was demonstrated through his mathematical genius at the blackjack table up to this point alan was presented as a person with questionable intelligence moreover the entire film was an irony of situation illustrated by the backfiring of events that started shortly after their arrival to caesars palace their grand plans for a final bash for doug resulted in one bad experience after anotheralbeit vastly different plots and era the theme for this movie is similar to that of saving private ryan the themes are similar because they both establish focus on unit loyalty sticking together and taking care of each other while under duress finally the theme of the movie was well illustrated at the end of the movie during the final scene the scene showed the four friends sitting together on the patio away from the rest of the wedding guests enjoying a moment alone with each other crickets were in the background feet were kicked up and the four of them relaxing together on the patio away from the wedding guests moreover they were all together at the end just like they were on the outset of their trip,comedy
debuting in 2009 the is a masterpiece of comedy by director todd phillips the results in a comical chemical reaction as bradley cooper phil ed helms stu zach galifianakis alan and justin bartha doug descend on las vegas nevada for dougs bachelor partyas the title alludes to the mayhem doesnt start until the morning after as phil stu and alan go on a rollercoaster ride through the streets of vegas dealing with an assortment of characters piecing the night before together in search of doug who has gone missing inevitably proving that bachelor parties can get out of had and that friendship can be indelible this movie truly was a nonstop laugh out loud success phil stu and alan are on a race against time to find their friend doug the groomsman before the weekend ends as they recover from the chemicals of the night before they must face orthodontic issues a baby  a wild animal a heavy weight champion irate officers and various other mishaps in search of their buddythe puts me in mind a movie filmed over a decade earlier starring christian slater and cameron diaz entitled very bad things very bad things was a much darker comedy and in addition a crime thriller a group of friends head to las vegas for a bachelor party and the drama unfolds like the very bad things proves that bachelor parties can get out of had and that friendship can be indelible in both movies partying gets extremely out of control and the friends have unforgettable momentsin the lighting makeup work and offscreen or invisible sounds were effectively employed to enlarge the boundaries of the visual frame these combined elements create mood and atmosphere in the that recreates the urgent feeling expressed throughout the film in which the three friends phil stu and alan race against the clock to piece together the events of the night before and find dougthere are plenty of movies out there with bachelor parties gone awry and the indelibleness of friendship as the theme however i havent seen a movie in a long time that has kept me laughing out loud from one well crafted scene to the next from the beginning to the end the takes the audience on a hysterically action packed ride of endurance and camaraderie never have i seen a move that has the characters play so well off of one another phil stu and alan are wonderful together the is phenomenally funny,comedy
though really nothing could spoil this movieits already rottenthe doesnt even deserve a 1 what a waste of time four revolting morons drive to vegas and have a series of adventures that they cannot remember because they were given a daterape drug by their fat completely disgusting buddy who thinks its ecstasy that brings up about a thousand issues in my mind not the least of which is the question why they didnt leave him on the side of the road when he admitted to drugging them as several people have mentioned here the is not only derivative but has clearly borrowed material from other movies as well example the tiger trashing the car  the deer trashing the car in tommy boy the scene is filmed in exactly the same way add into the mix bits and pieces of three men and a baby the freshman american pie very bad things etc etc etc and hey youve got several funny movies rolled into one boring stupid nasty messi could go on but ive wasted enough time with this execrable film already nothing new under the sun here its all been done before,comedy
the is perhaps the funniest movie ive ever seen i would gladly see it again and againthe film begins as the main cast is sitting in the mojave desert one of the main characters phil bradley cooper calls a bride he informs her that they screwed up big time he tells her that the wedding isnt going to happen because they have lost the groom the movie then flashes back in time two days as a group of friends are preparing for a bachelor party in las vegas the group includes schoolteacher phil dentist stu ed helms the groom doug justin bartha and dougs future brotherinlaw alan zach galifianakis an eccentric and slightly crazy guy with a round belly and jesus beardthe group goes onto the roof of caesars palace for drinks and then wake up the next morning without remembering a thing i was both glad and upset to not see a party scene however the way the movie does it fits perfectly anyway they wake up the next morning with their 4200 suite trashed a tiger in the bathroom a crying baby a chicken and a missing tooth the gangs search for what happened the night before provides content for the rest of the filmthe group then realize that doug their best friend is missing they set out to find him in sin city where anything is possible the search takes them to a wedding chapel a police station a strippers apartment and mike tysons estate the entire journey is fueled with laughs which never stopthis movie is directed by todd philips old school  road trip this is by far his best film the cast with no huge stars still worked incredibly well together and created an unstoppable team of comedy although bradley cooper ed helms and ken jeong with the small role of mr chow were all funny nothing prepared me for zach galifianakis before the galifianakis was virtually unheard of this film was a make or break movie for him and i say he scored perfectly his character alan is lovable but incredibly dumbwitted and is hard to hate overall this is the comedy event of the year maybe even the century,comedy
i heard so much hype about this movie that i thought my expectations were to high to enjoy it when i did finally get around to seeing it i laughed the entire movie i love how random all of the humor is and the twists keep the pace quick and the laughs coming i suggest people to pick it up or at least netflix it its most certainly worth more then one watch great acting with huge budget allows for insane comedy antics like a tiger in a mercedes benz loli cant wait for the second one to come out i hope they live up to the first i really think they can surpass it if they really tried i just hope its not a rushed piece of pooh and more of a funny well thought out epic roller coaster ride of awesomeness,comedy
the is a comedy which you can watch over and over and still find in it funny things youve never noticed before from the opening scenes it is instantly hilarious and it is the first film in a long time that has actually made me laugh out loudthe absurdities of the situations that the characters got in the night before cover over some of the plot loopholes and there are many like what happened to the guy at the wedding place who got shot and how did they know where mike tyson lived these are just a few of many things that let it down however not enough to ruin the experiencethe has fast become one of my favourite films to watch when im ill it is now in the list of comedies that i enjoy to make me feel better along with johnny english dude wheres my car monty pythons life of brian and mike basset england manager it has become one of my five favourite comedy genre filmsthe only other bad thing is that all of my other favourite comedies are much more satirical they were made with a purpose of attacking something and getting some sort of social point across to the audience for example life of brian attacks the trivialities of religion and the fickleness of human nature in the there is none of this the narrative has no depth granted it is very very funny but once the jokes are taken away it is nothing at allthe films script and narrative are incredibly well devised so that even when there are no slapstick jokes there are so many witty things that the characters say it doesnt matterthe is in essence everything a comedy should be it makes the audience laugh consistently and is easy to watch and enjoy whilst offering no real depth and making no points810,comedy
fun that is the first word that comes to mind when i think of this movie it was a blast to watch funny and strange all at once the premise is that a group of friends head to vegas for a bachelor party they wake up the next day with s none of them recalling events of the night prior and noticing that the groomtobe is mysteriously missing what follows is their adventures in vegas to make sense of the strange surroundings they have awoken to a tiger in the bathroom and a baby in the closet is the tip of the iceberg their quest to find their missing friend while also trying to remember how it is they got into this mess in the first place bradley cooper is an up and coming it boy you can tell and yes he is charming and great in the film but so are all of the actors the writing is solid the film will make you laugh a great comedy for adults to enjoy,comedy
with all due respect to judd apatow and his outrageous filmography the is probably the best comedy of the decade maybe the best since the big lebowski what is so good about this film that it was heaped upon with critical and box office acclaim not to mention a golden globe for best comedy of course there are terrific oneliners and other jokes you will be quoting long after seeing the movie but there is also the reason for how innovative of a comedy this actually isa very common plot of many modern comedies involves people getting drunk going to las vegas letting completely loose before a wedding these are plot elements that have become so simple and common it is almost impossible to realize just how serious and dangerous they can be although the film makers will probably deny this there is a definite part of this movie that is antidrugalcohol this film shows the true nature of the vegas lifestyle crazy wild and totally unpredictable in terms of what situations you can get yourself into certainly no one will see this as something to glean from the movie but it certainly separates this comedy from all the othersnot to mention the story line of this movie and how it uses the flashback to bring us along this is a plot technique usually reserved for dramas thrillers more serious films yet director todd phillips and writers jon lucas and scott moore make it work because they take their time setting up the situations pacing at just the right speed never punching home the jokes and setups like a sitcom through a series of interviews and searching the guys slowly start to unravel that crazy night they have no memory of this makes it funnier because we learn at the same time the characters do so their reactions are funnierof course none of this would be possible without the terrific cast led by the talented bradley cooper proving he can play a multidimensional character his support group is ed helm of the office very funny as a whipped dentist and newcomer zach galifianakis as the slow but very funny alan the groom in distress is justin bartha very strong as doug and other supporting actors include heather graham as a stripper with a heart of gold ken jeong as a mysteriously creepy asian crime boss jeffrey tambor as the allunderstanding fatherinlaw and mike tyson as himselfwith all innovative plot techniques and subtle messages aside this is a very funny movie the writing as a strong dark tone to it which makes you laugh but also think about these characters and their motivation unlike films that just go for the big laugh like wedding crashers old school and anchorman well this film does too but it does it in such a fresh and exciting way for comedies the standard has now been raised,comedy
when the sum of a films entertaining parts fit into its widely distributed trailer you know something is wrong the humor it devised itself is absurdly sophomoric and while that can put a smirk on your face as you reminisce on your college bingedrinking years it just doesnt justify an entire film the rest of the humor which is presented awfully just isnt original the cast is simply bad racial stereotypes are always a winner in movies and this one just proves it why are we so keen to praise such a film well only get more crap like this if we incessantly tell hollywood it has us rolling on the floor a good concept does not necessarily a good film make which is damn unfortunate,comedy
when i saw the advert i thought it was going to be some sort of low laugh and low budget comedy with the same kind of premise as dude wheres my car but when i heard it was a surprise hit at the cinemas i changed my mind about seeing it from director todd phillips old school road trip basically doug billings justin bartha and tracy garner sasha barrese are going to be married in two days and to celebrate doug and his buddies have borrowed the beloved mercedes of fatherofthebride sid jeffrey tambor for a 24hour stag party in las vegas his buddies are immature school teacher phil wenneck bradley cooper and worrying dentist stu price ed helms plus tracys unhygienic brother alan zach galifianakis are going to las vegas the next morning the three guys wake up with a really bad after the long night of drinking with no memory of what happened and doug has gone missing after leaving their trashed and tiger filled suite they begin looking for doug as well as having their steps retraced with clues going to the places they went and meeting the people they dont remember along the way they find out they had been to hospital stolen a police car stu had pulled his own tooth and married stripper jade heather graham she is the mother of the baby they had they stole the tiger from mike tyson and much more besides alan realises they do not remember anything because he put what he thought was ecstasy in their drinks but it was actually the date rape drug roofinol aka roofies and it is when they meet the man who gave them by paying a ransom to mr chow ken jeong for the exchange of a black doug mike epps there is the point when they are sure they cant get doug back and have to tell tracy the truth but then they realise where he is and was all along and they race to get back in time for the wedding after the whole experience there is a happy ending for pretty much everyone as well as a montage of photos of the whole night they do not remember accompanied by the song right round by flo rida feat keha it is one of the funniest films i have seen for years it might be a slightly familiar format but it is done so well and the jokes and script are so well crafted that you just go with the flow the three leads are great fun to watch the visual and written jokes are hysterical and a great soundtrack including baha mens who let the dogs out the usher ludicrous and lil jon song yeah and live your life by ti feat rihanna accompanies the action so all in all a fantastically hilarious comedy it is nominated the bafta for best original screenplay and it won the golden globe for best motion picture  musical or comedy very good,comedy
its hard for me to believe that this movie has a rating of 8 stars while i feel that im being extremely generous giving it 6 stars it kind of reminds me of when i saw slumdog millionaire last year which was also a movie that was overhyped until it actually won the best picture award that was a complete travesty this movie though not nearly as bad as slumdog certainly doesnt deserve the praise that ive been hearingit won the golden globe award a few nights ago for best motion picture  musical or comedy now that ive seen it that is so hard to believe the only other movie that was nominated in that category that i have watched so far was julie  julia which i thought was a better movie im sure that after i see the other movies nominated in that category there will probably be a couple more that i would rate higher than the i cant say that positively but i feel pretty certain that will be the casethis movie like slumdog will be forgotten in a few years by most but will still unfortunately be in the record books and all the 10 star ratings i think a lot of people saw this movie drunk because they felt that it was the appropriate thing to do,comedy
not since 1984s bachelor party with tom hanks has a good old bachelor movie come along like the doug justin bartha is getting married and heads to vegas for a low key bachelor party with mates phil bradley cooper stu ed helms and alan zach galifianakis aka fat jesusthe night doesnt turn out as planned and they wake to find their hotel room trashed a tiger in the bathroom a baby in the closet and the groom missing with no memory of what happened the rest of the movie is a hilarious trek through vegas trying to put the pieces togetherthere are no big name comedians instead a chemistry that develops quickly between the guys which makes the comedy work especially from zach galifianakis who really shines heather graham is as hot as usual and mike tyson has a cameo which is the only part i didnt like a lot of improvisation can be felt through out the whole film and there are some great photos at the end credits that looked like they really did go on a wild night in vegas,comedy
comedy is the most underestimated of all genres most writers think they can write a good movie comedy if theyre funny they think all you have to do is string together a lot of jokes and gags and youll have a successful comedy script how wrong they areits not just amateurs who make this mistake many of the top comedy screenwriters in the business write frontloaded scripts meaning they try to pack as many jokes in the first ten minutes as they can that seems like a good idea once you get the audience laughing theyre bound to keep laughing in reality these scripts hit the wall about ten to fifteen minutes in and miraculously theyre not funny anymore the writers dont realize that theyve made the classic mistake of starting with the small  the joke  and trying to go big instead they should have started with the big  the right comic story structure  and the jokes would have come naturally from the characterthe is a textbook example of how to write a comedy script the right way this is the story of four guys who go to las vegas for a bachelor party and end up in a nightmare the normal approach to writing this story is to follow them throughout the night as they make one mistake after anotherto see why writers jon lucas  scott moore didnt use this approach take a close look at the photos of this horrible experience that play over the end credits what you see are four drunk guys doing outrageous things the fountain the tiger the baby the wrong guy ha ha ha right wrong first of all drunk people arent funny at least not for longer than ten seconds its similar to the old actors rule if the actor cries the audience wont if the actor laughs the audience wont a drunk making a fool of himself may be hilarious to him but not to the sober people watchingbut theres a bigger reason this wouldnt have worked its all the same story beat those outrageous events may seem different on the surface but comically and structurally theyre all the same thing drunk guys doing stupid things and that means that there would have been no narrative drive and no plot the script would have hit the wall after fifteen minutes and all we would see is actors trying to top what just happened in an increasingly desperate attempt to generate laughsnotice also that that story strategy would have broken another key comedy rule comedy should come from character once four individuals become mindlessly drunk they turn into a single character the drunk idiot so not only would we have no plot wed have no characterso lets look at the comic story structure these screenwriters did use amazingly enough this is a detective story told with a storyteller frame the desire line to find out what happened to doug the groomits rare for a comedy to use this structure fletch and who framed roger rabbit are two but its a very good idea the detective story has one of the strongest narrative drives of any genre which means you can hang a ton of jokes on it without being afraid of collapsing the storyline and because the story tracks the three friends while they are sober all of the jokes can come from character from the unique flaws and personalities of the three guysthe detective structure gives this script another huge advantage that most other movie comedies lack a plot the detective form is the most revealheavy of all genres and reveals are one of the keys to plot where the normal approach to a raunchy comedy would have provided almost no plot the detective form told with a storyteller frame gives the heroes and the audience an almost unlimited supply of surprises as they slowly piece together what really happened the night beforein the comedy class i talk extensively about the 11 key story beats for comedy the beats for the seven major comic story structures  action comedy traveling angel buddy picture romantic comedy farce black comedy and satire  setting up and paying off jokes and the many ways you can make the comedy come from character this script uses a lot of those techniques the is not perfect even with the detective structure the story and the comedy both flag for a while but this script does show clearly how choosing the right comic structure at the beginning makes all the difference between a blockbuster comedy and the thousands of other comedy scripts that never even make it to the screenfor more reviews visit wwwtrubycom,comedy
the is one of 5 nominees for the golden globe best motion picture  musical or comedy i dont see how this could make it to 5 out of 5 heather graham as an escort is the sweetest thing to come out of this movie  really her character is sweet bright and charming unlike anything else herein dont expect this one to make the oscar short listthere is some mildly funny original music as the dentist sits down to a piano and sings stus song  a summary of the plot thus far familiar tunes are tritely placed and the wedding singer is as gross as the rest of the plotviolence pain property destruction deceptive abusive relationships injuries drug abuse vulgarity in front of children throwing money around like it doesnt matter trashing a hotel room and automobiles  these things make me uncomfortable not amusedmy idea of fun is something i can remember and want to remember somehow im hoping i dont remember any more of this film,comedy
i have to say that it was so refreshing to watch a comedy movie that had all the right elements going on and kept you there laughing even as the credits were rolling unbelievably good very refreshing to see a great comedy when it seemed as if the whole genre was getting stale what i liked most was this story just kept throwing one twist after another your just completely left guessing as to what was going to happen next the premise is the group has lost one of their foursome overnight and none of them can remember where he might have ended up its a great plot vehicle because you find yourself so intrigued as well and it almost plays out as a mystery albeit an extremely hilarious mystery movie just brilliant inspired writing here they took a great premise and really went with it and the movie does not let up you get really hooked on the characters and i found myself rooting for them all and it makes for a really great ending simply great best comedy i have seen in years,comedy
let me start by saying that this film was the absolute funniest movie of 2009 director todd phillips has created comedic gold in this buddy comedy about a bachelor party in las vegas that goes horribly wrong when the groom goes missing now his three friends must piece together what happened over a night none of them remember to locate him in time for his approaching wedding similar to dude wheres my car but in a more adult vein its hilarious to watch the events unfold as the guys find out just how insane their missing night was id been excited to see this movie when it came to theaters having heard all the hype building behind it and it lived up to all id readthe cast was phenomenal in this movie the three main characters bradley cooper ed helms and zach galifianakis were hilarious especially the character of alan galifianakis future brotherinlaw alan was the requisite outcast character whos slowwitted nature never seems to fit with the cool phil cooper or the highstrung stu helms supporting the main trio are a slew of cameos as the guys retrace their steps to find the truth jeffrey tambor heather graham ken jeong and mike epps pop in for a few laughs and even mike tyson has a few scenes where hes surprisingly funnythere isnt too much i can say about the film without risking dropping spoilers as the film is just as much a mystery as it is a comedy the film ranks as one of the funniest raunchy buddy comedies ive seen and was a much appreciated surprise when i caught in in theaters its an intelligent comedy with the perfect level of immaturity and some great performances which should be enough to entertain anyone check it out and be sure to sit through the first half of the end credits where they show photos from the missing camera and shed some more light on the most insane bachelor party,comedy

stu price why dont we remember a god damn thing from last night phil wenneck obviously because we had a great fing timetodd phillips is a director who has become well known for creating movies that appeal to young people who want to see a movie about drinking too much and partying hard the is no different from some of his past moviesthe follows four best friends doug billings justin bartha phil wenneck bradley cooper stu price ed helms and alan garner zack galifianakis the men are headed out to las vegas for one last crazy night before doug gets married that weekend as the title would suggest that is just what the men have one crazy night the rest of the movie is spent trying to figure out just what happened the night before if you have never seen a todd phillips movie in the past this one is no different the contains all of the dirty humor that fans of phillips movies have come to love if you have never seen a todd phillips movie be forewarned that you are in for lots of crude humor and non stop laughs each character brings their own form of comedy to the screen alan is dougs soon to be brother in law he is the black sheep of the family and is constantly saying inappropriate and stupid things that keep the laughs coming phil is the one who constantly pulls the group back together he may not be the most level headed one in the group but he is just what the group needs to throw caution to the wind stu is the quiet friend who gets picked on and just tags along he may not like the decisions that the group is making but he follows along because he is too passive to disagree finally there is doug he is the most grown up of the group doug is the whole reason for the group coming together as he is the one getting married take alan stu phil and doug mix them with way too much alcohol and a night in sin city and now you have the once again todd phillips has made a movie that makes every viewer wish they were there for the party,comedy
ive never laugh so hard  for such a sustained long period of time during a movie except for this one the 4 guys are great friends but each have their own idiosyncrasy  different ways of having outrageous silly fun  dealing with preposterous problems just imagine after their stu cant recall how he lost his tooth phil has no idea why he has a hospital tag around his wrist alan has become more socially awkward  doug the bridegroom has gone missing nobody remembers what actually happened  each is clueless why they have a baby in their possession  a live tiger lurking in their hotel suites bathroom the story plot offers plenty of absolute fun and hilarity do try not to leave before the credits end as there are sidesplitting photoshots awaiting for you to laugh your way out of the cinema even long after the movie ends please go watch it with a relaxed mind as it can be a virtue to be able to laugh at ourselves  others as they provide us as mirrors for our own reflections in life indeed laughter is a good medicine,comedy
well produced generally well directed generally wellacted the technical work and editing do help push the creaky old storyline alongthe writing is soso the narrative structure is tepid punctuated with precious few fleeting flashes of clevernessin short the writersproducers believed that overthetop actingdirecting could carry a movie with a narrative premised on a druginduced lost night if there was some kind of brilliant twist or tourdeforce it would redeem the exercise unfortunately the development is a surprisingly prosaic vanilla treatment of the premisei know this approach works ok for some folks i watched this on the recommendation of a guy id just met who seemed like a pretty smart fellow but it turns out to have been a pretty tame product if you expect quality narrative from a movie skip it,comedy
i really like todd phillips as a director he knows how to bring teenage lame humor as something hilarious and also convincing his movies have the power to be likable and even credible ones due to its likable main antihero characters not matter what crazy situations they are being put inthis movie is basically one movie to goes from the one crazy event into the other one yet it doesnt loose its focus on its main plot and also knows to find the time to work on its characters as well the characters are all being handled and buildup well into the movie its the same type of comedy approach phillips used earlier for movies such as road trip and old schoolthe movie relies heavily on its main concept it feels like though that the entire story got based around the writers idea of having a couple of guys wake up in a wrecked hotel room and things are missing and other things suddenly are in their room and most importantly one of their buddies who is about to get married is missing its like they first come up with this idea and then decided to write and base the entire story around this this has as a result though that not all things reach a satisfying closure it also has as a result that things get raveled at times as can best been seen during its end credits when gets revealed what happened all during their long night they remembered nothing about the next morningso well no the movie isnt perfect but still its one of the more enjoyable ones of recent years along with tropic thunder the movie is throughout funny and even during its weaker moments it knows to entertain which is also due to its characters the movie has a sort of adventurous feeling over it since the movie jumps from the one extreme event into the other one its a comedyodysseythe movie doesnt really feature any well known comedy actors in it for its main parts this works well though for the story i feel since in cases when movies have big comedystars in it the movie and its humor mostly rely on the performances from those stars and puts most of the emphasis one them in this case it can rely more on its story situations and the characters as individuals the movie still features some well known actors in it though mostly in some cameoroles there are not too many though which is a good thing so it doesnt ever get distractingits a real good and fun movie810httpbobafett1138blogspotcom,comedy
i dont care that this movie is stupid i like stupid comedies thats not the problem with this film the problem is that whoever wrote the jokes to this movie was having a really fcked up writers block and in desperation went to his nearest blockbuster and rent every stupid comedy made in the last 20 years and in a very messy operation start copypasting every joke and storyline so now we got this stupid movie that some studio executive that really dislike watching movies approve under the assumption that this has some originality but really it should be being announced as a parody like the unwatchable  movie saga from the infamous seltzerfriedberg couplethe extremely high rating is something i can only explain myself telling me that most of the voters havent ever seen a comedy before or that we are living in a crescent more stupid society that can even get that the what happen last night storyline has a king in the stupid comedy realm and thats dude where is my car or that the bachelor party storyline has its begging and its end with bachelor party or that the cool guy that hate his life but at the end he discovers that really loves his wife and kid it has been done since the 1920s or that the wimp who is scared of his girlfriend but at the end redeem himself by rebelling against his wimpiness is the most common character in film history and the list goes on and onthis movie is the copy of the copy of a few good movies it can entertain obviously it can but it doesnt deserve an over 7 rating not even and over 6 for me is a 4 is funny but im tired to see copies and overall like the unoriginal as something can be,comedy
i am baffled by the high user ratings how many movies have involved a group of guys a bachelor party specifically going to vegas what new ideas did this present besides the chronological gimmickjust thinking about it now this movie was very similar to the simpsons episode wherein homer and flanders go to las vegas it was also somewhat like a subplot of knocked up etcbut the bigger problems are as another post here says is that it did not really make sense and worst of all what was so funny about it i can think of but a single bit that elicited an outright laugh and maybe a couple of other things that made me smile but thats about it,comedy
i did not have very high expectations going into this film like many others i figured that the previews accounted for most of the humor i was wrong in that assumption however much of the humor was extremely predictable and many of the scenes resembled what you can find in old school a much much better movie overall this is especially apparent in the wedding reception scene when the same wedding singers from old school which i have no problem with are performing if you watch the father of the bride jeffrey tambor as he reacts to the singers own special version of the song youll find that it is eerily similar to frank the tanks reaction to the same situation in old school i cant hate on todd phillips too much because i think he makes good movies but i really wish he would have made this movie a bit more original with less predictable scenes 510 since ive seen old school 710 if i hadnt,comedy
i guess youll probably know by now the yardstick i use for comedies and thats if i dont laugh until my tears flow uncontrollably then its not 5star funny granted that there wasnt any comedic situation here that had warranted my laughter from the belly and opened my tear ducts it did have some classic moments that would bring out some genuine mirth albeit sporadically though the film managed to fuel itself up to last the 100 minute distancedoug justin bartha is about to get married and as a rite of passage his best male pals in schoolteacher phil bradley cooper dentist stu ed helms and brotherinlawtobe alan zach galifianakis decide that they should have a no holds barred bachelors party in sin city las vegas after all whatever happens in vegas stays in vegas but who wouldve counted upon a ragtag group to deliver him there and back safely and on time for his big day since phils pretty much the frat boy leader of the group just too eager to let his hair down stus toeing the thin line of being the partypooper having to deal with an overbearing girlfriend and alans just plain rain man dumb which of course is perfect for some nonsensical one liners and momentsafter a wild night out which we dont get to see and so to keep you guessing dougs found to be missing and to add to that jon lucas and scott moores story sets everything up for the events soon to follow planting elements such as those which youve seen in the trailer  a broken tooth a baby a tiger in the bathroom a hotel suite totally trashed and a stolen police car every element links to something that happened in the last 12 hours and its up to the trio to establish the series of events from the clues presented so as to find out where their groom could possibly beit plays out like fusion of a comedy and a light hearted mystery since none of them could even remotely remember what they did and that too is not a stone left unturned the fun factor came from how the trio of cooperhelmsgalifianakis share some incredible chemistry as boys who discover their hand firmly within the cookie jar having to untie the knotty mess that they find themselves in and to add to the delight a lot of events happening in proper chronological order have plenty of random bits to keep you tickled pink before you realize that they all actually made sense especially when you have enough clues to piece them all together after this im on the lookout for future galifianak projects as it seemed that hes now a contender up the jack blacks niche alleydirector todd phillips had thrown in plenty of the staple profanity and token nudity commonly found in hollywood mass comedies and not forgetting racial stereotypes such as drug dealers and effeminate gangster chiefs all for the sake of eliciting some laughs something you can credit phillips for though is trying to sustain a comedy but unleashing the funny bits in a restrained manner so as to evenly spread out laughter though the last 20 minutes to its inevitable finale did seem to fizzle out a little until the end credits roll for that photo montagethe boasts a contemporary pop soundtrack though the winner in the film is of course las vegas itself with the film being quite a shrewd city promotional video with its glitzy night time neon lights and showcasing a host of activities one could get into such as casinos that never sleep and quickieweddings in small specialized churches for that purpose having spent a week at the same city its a treat of course to revisit on screen some of the places ive previously set foot on and if opportunities present themselves again im pretty sure im going backcomedy of the year this may not be in my books but it does have enough to make it pretty delightful to sit through especially if youre in the company of buddies who share the same traits as the characters or sharing the same sense of humour,comedy

similar to actors when a director puts out several movies that i enjoy eg eastwood spielberg bay etc i tend to follow their projects closely not only their current projects but also their future ones phillips is the next great director and his genre is comedies his first movie i enjoyed was road trip 2000 which he then followed with what i considered not only his personal best but probably the funniest movie of my generation old school 2003 these were followed by a couple of soso movies starsky  hutch 2004 and school for scoundrels 2006 these two were not terrible just not up to par with his prior gems well my friends phillips is back and with a bang with the unlike his prior movies there are no bona fide star but i can assure you that this movie will launch the four main characters cooper galifianakis helms and bartha into stardom the movie has a simple premise four friends go to vegas to celebrate a bachelor party only to have everything go completely wrong like that hasnt been done before but what makes this film special is that from the time you sit down to watch the movie until the very end make sure you stay for the credits you are laughing nonstop the dialog the situations etc had me laughing hysterically the other thing that makes this movie great is that even after you leave the theater you might be watching tv working or doing some other activity a couple of lines from the movie will cross your mind and youll start laughing again that is what i consider a great movie when you think about a movie and enjoy it as if you were watching it of course the movie is not for everyone as phillips tends to push the envelope some people may consider some of the scenes offensive but i think it really works this movie wont win any oscars but others will now be following mr phillips career very closely,comedy
the is one of those rare gems that surprise you not much hype for this movie but once the trailer hit the theaters advertising from the guy who brought you old school i was ready for a hilarious comedy and a hilarious comedy is what i got right from the beginning of the film the story sucks you in and makes you wonder what the hell happened and so they begin to explain everything you just have to be patient the best character that just had me laughing so hard was adam played by zach galifianakis a bit of a newcomer when it comes to films but definitely has what it takes for a successful career in hollywood go see this film then go see it again because youll miss a lot of the movie the first time around because of extreme laughter,comedy
i would give it an 85 but you cant it is a hilarious movie i have not laughed some much at the theater in my life i was even tearing up i laughed so hard at times i dont want to give away anything but another good thing is it is not one of those movies that shows all the funny parts in the trailers although they dont show the tiger in the elevator scene in the actual movieit is very entertaining and is of the old school and road trip mentality and has the usual cameo by phillips dont go in expecting the best movie in the last 10 years just know it will be funny and worth the 10 bucks the cast fit well with each other and kept me laughing most of the movie make sure you watch the credits,comedy
if some good clean fun is what youre after the is not the film for you the film will however deliver two out of three minus cleandirector todd phillips old school starsky  hutch offers as much raunch wit and general shock value in his newest comedy as the typical laugh seeker could ask for and though the doesnt quite reach the same level of true humor as old school it comes closethe film centers around the aftermath of a vegas bachelor party the events of which unfold as the celebrants  sans the missing groom to be  investigate their nocturnal circumstances in order to find their friend amidst the worst s of their lives what they find far surpasses the embarrassing photo or pukestained clothes that usually accompany the day after woes of a night of bad decisionsbradley cooper and ed helms deliver solid comedic performances but its the uniquely odd yet amusing qualities of zach galifianakis performance that transform the film into the laughoutloud movie it is a supporting role of bubbly heather graham also brings the film some charmwatch for appearances by mike tyson matt walsh bryan callen and dan finnerty some of phillips staples and mr phillips himselfall of which add an extra hey factor to the keen observerthe doesnt breach the cosmic levels of comedic genius we always hope for but it makes for an amusing evening worth full price,comedy
the is one of those movies that could have really been something special if the pieces were placed together well the plot was engaging the acting was great the pacing was perfect and the premise itself is something unique and overall a winwin scenario what was left the content within the plot the right blend of humor and comical suspense could elevate this to one of the comedic greats of recent decades but they just missed the mark barely missed the mark oh but it was so close the is an excellent story about escapades and mayhem in vegas and their consequences but gets hindered because of the overload of crude humor softer second act and an underwritten character that wasnt funny at all despite these setbacks the is worthy of a viewing especially if you enjoyed todd phillips brand of crude adult humorin the surprisesleeper hit of the summer we follow two good friends of the groom and the brides brother taking the groom to vegas for a bachelor party before the wedding all of a sudden it is morning three of the four wakes up to a disastrous room and a random baby nearby oh and theres a chicken and a tiger in the hotel room as well one is missing a tooth the other has scratches everywhere and one is missing pants the groom is missing the rest of the movie is spent picking up clues as to what happened how it happened and where on earth the groom went the setup is crazy and the events that unfolded the evening before was just as crazy this is a sort of script the mainstream hasnt experienced in quite some time the movie becomes mostly comedy but with hints of mystery as wellthe best part of the movie is most definitely the screenplay which was molded well by jon lucas and scott moore instead of a ferrell or apatow production which creates a situation and improvisation fills in the gaps the relies strictly on plot and what twists and turns are thrown to our main characters the peeps encounter an angry mike tyson disgruntled cops gangsters and much more in the span of 48 hours that follow the mysteriously drunken evening this is the first raunchy comedy script ive seen that deserves at least an oscar nod for its creativity since the 40yearold virgin several years agoof course its the premise that sold the tickets since virtually nobody knew who was actually in the film nonetheless bradley cooper and ed helms steal the show with their outstanding performances as the frontrunners in the chase for the truth of the previous evening and the groom everyone else even mike tyson does a respectable job with the exception of one zach galifianakis role as the screwloose brother of the bride just falls flat most of the time his character comes cross as a mix of a pedophile a druggie and brick from anchorman in terms of the random statements and questions this mix fails because steve carell perfected the dimwit role as brick and there virtually no consistency with alans character he is the one role that was not fleshed outyour other drawback is the amount of crude humor crude humor is best in small doses see blazing saddles airplane dumb and dumber 40yearold virgin in the its a bit overblown and sometimes is used to try to save a scene todd phillips improved upon his pacing abilities and good shots of las vegas but still relies too much on crude humor and not enough on other ways to make the audience laugh the tale didnt need the gross comedy and would have been a great production altogether if they had toned down on the nastiness the final scene makes you want to cringe almostbottom line not as funny as everyone is making it out to be but its still a hilarious movie full of unpredictable moments and insanity this sleeper hit proves you dont need big stars to make money just deliver a premise too fun to pass up the writing is superb the acting for the most part is great and the surprises keep you engaged with what is going on if you can get past the crude then youll find a gem thats a few polishes away from truly shining among the greats instead it settles for phillips best film since old school and one of the funniest raunch fests of the decade,comedy
this movie had me laughing from beginning to end there were some really funny moments such as when the naked chinese man jumped out of the trunk and beat them up i really liked that mike tyson was involved in the movie since they stole his tiger i didnt understand that when they were drunk the tiger came easily but later when they took it back it wasnt i also loved the ending it was possibly the best comedy ending i ever saw when they showed the pictures from the night before when this movie comes out on dvd i will definitely buy it unrated i want to watch it over and over also all the actors did amazing they were definitely the ones for a waiting for the 2,comedy
the success of old school pretty much vaulted todd phillips onto the alist for comedy directors we waited and waited for his second hit but only got the mediocre starsky and hutch and what i can only imagine as disappointing school for scoundrels the lives up to the exorbitant amount of praise being tossed around everywhere the buzz is running rampant online and rumors of a sequel have already started months before the film is even released movies pertaining to the alcohol induced shenanigans that can occur at a bachelor party two days before the weddingin vegas no lessalways bring something funny to the table the however trumps them all on sheer absurdity craziness and allaround hilaritydoug is about to marry the girl of his dreams a woman with wealth but also a family that seems grounded in reality it is a couple days before the nuptials and doug is on his way to vegas for a night of fun with his two best friends and soontobe brotherinlaw this foursome is such a mixed bag that you believe them to all be real friends doug is the successful who knows what we sadly learn very little about his character as he is a mere pawn for the evening to occur phil is the married teacher that hates his life marriage and children in general and stu is the nerdy doctorsorry dentistwithout a backbone but who you know can be wild when a few drinks have been imbibed as for alan the bridetobes brother he is the wild card of the bunch only having met phil and stu a few times and a bit off in the headhe is not a rahtard thoughyou never know how he may interact with the others nor what he may do or say about his wolfpack brothersthe evening starts with the four going to the hotels roof to take a shot of jager and toast the groom on one last night of partying it is right after this exchange that phillips brings us to the next morning stu minus a tooth alan without pants and in the company of a tiger and phil with no recollection that he was in the hospital sometime during the night well i dont want to knock phil too much no one remembers anything of what happened nor can they find doug in fact rather than their friend they find a baby crying in the closet amidst the strewnabout debris smoking chair and random chicken the boys realize that they have less than 48 hours to find the groom and get him to his wedding the adventure that commences takes them on a journey through the many locations they visited the night before compiling a timeline while allowing the audience to enjoy the laughs that come with the evidence of what happened and the reactions to it all from the threesome throw in a newly married stripper a gay asian with crimeworld pull angry and naked from being trapped in the trunk of a car a kidnapping a stolen police car and yes mike tyson singing phil collins and you can only imagine the uproarious laughter that will be emitting from your bodybut it is galifianakis who surprises the most and completely shines as the offkilter alan ill admit to mostly being turned off by his brand of humor generally jokes that run on too long and are too dry for their own good although he is the best thing in out cold here however it all works beautifully even when he risks going too far like with his wolfpack speech at the beginning phillips seems to have been able to cut him to the perfect length in order to maintain the joke and not destroy it he is a little childdont let the beard fool youand his innocence and ambivalence to what is going on around him is priceless his emotions get the better of him he wants nothing more than to be coopers best friend or carbon copy his delivery of absurd lines is so straightfaced you become as dumbfounded as stu and phil and his props add even more to the character his satchel his blackjack book and his roofies among other things enhance the jokes and the plot a moment with him and cooper mimicking rain man brings the laughs as does a slomo sequence between he and a little boy on a field trip to a police station when galifianakis is on screen you truly have no idea what will happen nexti know i have spoken little about the plot but really besides pertaining to three guys trying to remember what happened to them the night before and where their best friend went there isnt much else to say the could have easily fallen prey to the snl syndrome of just being skit after skit loosely connected into a story yet too disjointed to really enjoy but the cast and crew never let this happen bringing in actors like heather graham rachael harris and a scenestealing performance from ken jeong only expand the story rather than derail it the jokes come so quick and successfully that you have little time to question what is happening and you are laughing so hard that you are probably missing dialogue anyways and dont even get me started on mike tysons lisp he deserves a highfive for sure the only thing i can say is that you will laugh because honestly who wouldnt enjoy watching a night of excess that went so overboard its participants can only recall what happened through the xrated photos on their digital camera yes you do get to see those gems in all their glory during the end credits,comedy
i just got back from viewing the a movie i had never heard of until yesterday when i saw a commerical on television and several positive reviews im really glad i saw this because i had so much funof all the actors in the movie they were all exceptional but the one that really stood out and stole the show was definitely zach galifanakis somehow i had not been familiar with his standup routine but in this movie he was hilarious its a heavily quotable movie and 95 of the quotes that are going to be repeated would be things that he said all four or 3 of them worked together with so much chemistry actually having me believe at times that im watching real friendsthe plot was totally absurd but that was sort of the point the audience is in on the joke that we dont even know what they possibly could have done last night and its a great mystery to unravel every tiny detail of it and laugh because its exceptionally bizarrethe only complaint i could have was that it started off a little slow like maybe the first 25 minutes until they wake up with the after that point the laughs keep coming but the first quarter may persuade people to walk straight out of the theaterthis is without a doubt the funniest movie of the year and destined to become a classic what could beat it year one the proposal nah maybe funny people,comedy
this movie takes a familiar plot and turns it on its head you dont see the bachelor party you see the guys wake up with no recollection of what happened their hotel villa where they wake up is trashed and includes a tiger a chicken and a baby the groomtobe is missing you dont know what happened and neither do they you just know that something crazy happened as the guys try to piece together clues to find their friend they encounter the consequences of their crazy intoxicated behavior they are just as shocked as the audience as they encounter the people they dealt with the night before when they unknowingly consumed a powerful drug they have a strict time deadline to find their friend as the wedding is two days after the party one day after the so every turn they take gets more outrageous since you dont know how they know these people that know them and either hate them and want to hurt them or love them for reasons they dont know eventually things start to add up but only after the guys encounter situations that are completely bizarre the guys are relatively stereotypicalthe nerd who is whipped and uptight the stud who has a bit of a chip on his shoulder and the weirdo who makes everyone uncomfortable none of them is ready to deal with the trouble that they created while drugged so they are freaking out with what they encounter and the audience empathizes with them because we all have had that night where we have done something we regret while under the influence only it seems these guys have messed with some really crazy people this movie moves from laugh to laugh consistently and you dont know how far it will go the chemistry with the very different characters keeps getting better at the end you finally get to see what happened to set these events into motion at that point you realize these guys were just extremely druggedup guys who were trying to have a night to remember and were so messed up that they did some pretty stupid things this movie is great fun and a bit uncomfortable for those who have had nights where they have done things they dont remember,comedy
this movie is definitely worth seeing the entire cast is hilarious and the story is goofy but not silly think harold and kumar meets road trip i went in expecting a mediocre movie with a few laughs but i was laughing the entire time and it was just as good as knocked up or the 40 year old virgin this is not your over done vegas movie this is 4 guys getting as fued up as they can get in one night and then the hell they go through the next day without spoiling anything lets just say it involves chapels and the chinese i will be seeing this movie in the theatres at least once more do yourself a favor and go see this movie,comedy
the and the magnificent seven are the two most recent feature movies ive seen there are several significant points of comparison firstly according to this siteimdbis the 126th most popular film of all time while m7 does not make the top 250 as of june 10 2009 even though m7 is popular enough to be selected the second most often for presentation on television by network executives the past four decades secondly film studio execs marketed 1960s m7 primarily as a western while this summers is billed mostly as a comedy however steve mcqueen constantly tried various comic gambits to upstage yul brynner in m7 while s bachelor party crew looks east from la toward las vegas sin city reputation as the last vestige of the amoral wild west thirdly charles bronson is looking after three kids in peril throughout m7 while 75 per cent of the bachelor party quartet must take responsibility for a baby in peril during the first half of though there are many other eerie parallels between these two movies i must fight against public opinion to express a preference for m7 with elmer bernsteins classic musical score providing a clear edge to the earlier flick in terms of likely staying power though did better at the box office its initial week out even adjusting m7s gross for inflation thanks to the later movies better marketing campaign,comedy
this was a very funny movie i went in with high expectations after all my friends who saw it this last weekend talked about how it was one of the funniest movies they have ever seen i had seen the trailers and had wanted to see the movie but now i was stoked to see it my girlfriend and i went to see it because she had also heard it was a great movie this movie provided tons of laughs for the both of us i would definitely say this is a comedy you can take your girlfriend to and if she has any sense of humor will enjoy herself immensely the only bad thing about the movie was that a lot of the funny scenes were shown in the trailer i wish i had never seen the movie trailers there were also a few scenes that i was saying to myself i cant believe they are showing this in a movie but i left unoffended overall a funny movie worth seeing guys will love this movie and so will their girlfriends 910,comedy
seriously in what sense is this movie funnyi watched the whole movie with the face of a serious killer i thought i found a good trilogy but darn it im not planning on taking it further than this onelas vegasblahblahblahwe need good movies hollywood please,comedy
there are events in our lives that just can go awfully wrong like a bachelorrette party in that case its 4 guys who just want to celebrate the last night of freedom of one of them at the beach around a bonfire in las vegas harmless in the mind but when one of them has a wonderful idea to add drugs to the party everything goes upside down when the day came over the groom is missing the other three are in a mess with a tiger in their bathroom and a chicken in the living room in order to find their missing friends the last three have to remember what happened during this one wild night and enjoy the mess they created throughout the city the funniest part of this movie is the crazy journey those guys had been through with every people reacting to their presence as they saw the devil coming back and most of all the reaction of the three guys when they realize the huge mess they created at each place they visited and this lasts to the very end of the movie when they find back the groom and bring him back in time for the ceremony this is funny as well and it deserves the recognition this movie had throughout the world just like the two sequels which followed,comedy
what happens in vegas stays in vegas unless there is a hollywood film crew there to capture it what was supposed to be a bachelor party turned into a race against time to find the groom the is a unique kind of comedy that is one of a kind it is easy to say this movie was the best the first time thru but is still funny every time i watch the crazy antics portrayed in this movie are hysterical and have nonstop laughter from that awkward scene in the beginning with doug and allan till the pictures during the end credits i laughed at every joke and almost all of them hit dead on the plot to the is simple doug is getting married so three friends take him to vegas for a weekend they will never forget or remember they have a drink and the next thing they know three of them wake up in a destroyed hotel room doug missing a baby and a tiger in the bathroom chaos then ensues from there as they try to piece together the night and find doug before the wedding lets start with the characters allen is the lovable idiot who says and does stupid things but is the clown of the movie a lot of the comedy comes from him and he nails it his stupid comments bring a nice chuckle and his actions bring stomach aching laughter no spoilers bit most of the misfortune is his fault and the other two have to deal with his stupidity allan is easily the best character in the story and the fan favorite then there is stu now i hate stu there i said it he is a dentist who is whipped by his girlfriend and all he does throughout the movie is yell be obnoxious and be a debbie downer i may hate his character and may not be a big fan of ed helms the actor but his role meshed into the movie perfectly the movie needed a man like that in this situation and he played as the voice of reason and a maniac at the same time he is kind of a jerk but at the same time funny watching him and allan butt heads was hysterical stu says you are literally too stupid to insult thank you says allan it is little things like that which made the movie even better like i said i dont like stu but at least he had one of if not the funniest moment in the entire movie that of course is the scene when he plays the piano singing his song then we come to phil bradley cooper is fantastic in this movie he plays the cool and handsome guy who tries to keep things under control and deal with the situation from his first scene he sets the tone for his character watch the movie and if you pick upon it you will know what i mean phil is a great character who fits well into the story as the guy who can laugh at the situation but still understand how serious it is stu is an extreme and allan is beyond that but phil is in the middle and he is very entertaining to boot the movie opens with him on the phone explaining the situation and the mess they were in was funny because it made me think how they got there it made me want to see what happened and made me invested in the movie the is a comedy but it is a different type of comedy that works so well you laugh but at the same time it has a strong story and a great script you are along for the ride with these three and you want to find where doug is it is exciting and the twists and turns are something you see in a drama and not so much a comedy the story was so well written and kept the audience interested in the movie while rolling on the floor in laughter at the same time to that i say touch to the director and writers there was a major flaw in the movie and that my friends is chow now i know your reaction and people think chow was hilarious and possibly the best part of the movie but i disagree chow is a good character who needed to be in the movie and play his part but he was so over the top he tried so hard to be funny and at times he was funny and other times i thought it was forced his voice and his demeanor annoyed me when he rolls up the window making weird noises i couldnt laugh because i thought it was way too ridiculous i will give him credit because he has one of the most interesting and funny entrances into a series that i can think of i like the character chow i like his role in the movie i like how he wasnt over used i just thought he tried to hard to be something more than what he needed to be overall the is possibly the funniest movie i have ever seen dumb and dumber was the funniest until i saw this i think dumb and dumber was funnier but i liked this better problem solved i liked tysons cameo and when he sang phil collins in the air tonight i think i cried this movie wasnt only funny but fun at the same time i liked piecing together the events from the previous night and finding out where doug was really good actors great characters an amazing script basic but strong plot endless funny moments a high rewatch rate but a little bit of over acting at times gives the the willyt seal of approval,comedy
three close friends and the grooms strange brotherinlaw travel to vegas for a bachelor party they will never forget teacher phil bradley cooper is a womaniser with a wife and kids stu ed helms is in an unhappy marriage with an overbearing abusive wife doug justin bartha is the groom hoping for a sendoff to end all sendoffs and alan zach galifianakis is a naive manchild hoping to make friends when they wake up in the morning they find their suite demolished a tiger in the bathroom a baby in the closet and most worryingly of all doug is missing they clean themselves up and set out to find doug and using the various clues lying around they begin to piece together the nightof course bachelor party movies are hardly hard to come by and they have been a staple of the grossout comedy circuit since the 1980s the finds its originality in the fact that it focuses on the morning after rather than the actual night itself which we see none of it also has a sense of believability as if three of the characters have genuinely been friends for years and are gradually accepting the increasingly strange alan into their wolfpack after all alan is often unnervingly strange but the group find him funny too and why wouldnt they cult standup comedian galifianakis has been around for years starring in various failed pilots and never quite getting the attention he deserved but he is by far the best thing in the with the mixture of his quite sweet innocence and his random oneliners fitting in with the films heartfelt momentsit also keeps the gross humour thankfully down to a minimum sure its often bad taste but theres a noticeable lack of barebreasted women and any jokes involving bodily fluids this is still rrated but the humour is in the script and the performances and doesnt resort to someone shitting themselves for desperate laughs its similar in many ways to 2007s superbad where the language was filthy but the laughs were genuine and the situations however absurd still felt somewhat real and when the credits rolled i was left with that unfamiliar desire to spend more time with these characters special mention must also go to chinese gangster mr chow played by ken jeong who simply needs to be in more films who has one of the best comedy burn lines in history so long gay boyswwwthewrathofblogblogspotcom,comedy
i lived in vegas when this was made i was setup by my friend no less the doubledate from hell i thought it was going to be a total disaster a dirty raunchy movie that wasnt going to be funny and make me look like a jackass with my uptight first date the girls looked like they were ready to bolt for the doorthe girls started laughing first it redeemed it self almost immediately and just got betterits possible that we had a bias towards liking it  since we lived there and had seen things happen there like the guy who robbed the liquor store naked then went and hijacked a city bus with all its passengers still naked then got in a high speed chase with the cops and was finally arrested live on tv so yeah thats typical vegas for us the movie felt so much like home for us we couldnt help but like itif you have caviar tastes this is not the movie for you for the rest of us its money well spent,comedy
the 2009  12 out of 4 four buddies head off to vegas for a bachelor party but the next morning they wake up not knowing what happened the night before and discovering one is missing they must then try to retrace their steps and locate the missing buddy im always a bit hesitant to fall into the mass market when it comes to something popular because a lot of times i end up watching the film and it turns out to be a major disappointment but thats not the case with this gem because it lived up to its reputation and in my opinion passed them im not going to call this the greatest film of the year but i might add its the most original youd think a comedy about getting messed up in vegas would be been there done that but this takes a familiar set up and does something original with it instead of showing us the crazy party night we dont see a second of it and instead were thrown into a mystery and the laughs come from trying to figure out that mystery for my money the screenplay is nearly flawless as it does a great job at building up our thoughts on what happened but the film then takes us to places that you certainly wont see coming the majority of the laughs come from things that you normally wouldnt expect like a masterful scene involving a trunk even the jokes that you do expect strippers is done extremely well and with hilarious results i wont ruin many of the jokes because of the mystery behind them is what makes them work so well but there were several scenes where tears were running down my face from laughing so hard bradley cooper ed helms and zach galifianakis give terrific performances and their chemistry and comic timing with one another helps push the film even further the three make for an excellent team and watching this film makes it look like the trio had been working together for years because they come off so well together heather graham isnt too bad in her role and the great jeffrey tambor even gets a nice laugh you really have to respect a movie that takes a familiar plot and mixes it up to the point of it being completely original and most importantly downright hilarious i hate labeling films when theyre so fresh but i would be shocked if this movie isnt looked at in ten years the same way we look at dirty comedies like national lampoons animal house and porkys today,comedy
there isnt anyone in this movie that i would ever say i wanted to see in a movie the entire cast is completely unknown so i cant have any preconceptionsof course it did get a lot of teen choice nominations which would make it a movie i wouldnt go near except it may possibly make it on the expanded best picture list next year so i have to sorta watch itthe funniest parts of the movie were the supporting cast the wedding chapel manager the cops ken jeong  cleo king the doctor matt walsh the naked japanese guy mr chow ken jeong the tiger there was not one funny moment involving the main characters except for the escape in the cop car,comedy
funny stuff to be honest i wasnt the biggest fan of old school or roadtrip i thought both film were overrated but after seeing this im now a todd phillips follower the movie has a very simple plot line four guys go to vegas as a bachelor party and wake up hungover the thing that i liked about this movie that really had nothing to do with how funny it was was that it was well made some comedies have horrible lighting and visuals and only focus on the jokes but this movie looks great sounds great and was edited fantastically having said that it was naturally funny it didnt feel forced at all and and there was no political agenda behind it unlike shows like family guy and movies like harlod and kumar overall this movie was one of the funniest well done comedies i have ever seen everyone in the cinema was laughing and having a great time if you like to laugh which everyone should you will love this film,comedy
the is undoubtedly one of the best mainstream comedies of 2009 so far with that said its important to remember that comedies are rarely very funny and especially american ones and naming the one of the best comedies of 2009 its also important for me to say that i didnt find it very funny it was very entertaining and joyous but rarely laughoutloud funny most of the gags or jokes seemed somehow familiar and the sketches drawn into the script were occasionally misplaced the taser scene with that said the three main performances does everything to this movie bradley cooper as the cocky alphamale with a twist ed helms as the pussywhipped nerd and zach galifianakis being somewhat of a baby inside a grownup man and they were all great in their characters the whole atmosphere of the movie works greatly like what exactly happened last night and you pulsate in the same manic rhythm as their las vegas trip simply goes more and more terribly wrong and after a 100 minutes of las vegas meltdown its nice to see that the movies got a heart heather graham shines as a shattered stripper and the end credits are greatly provided with pictures from the night we never experienced,comedy
a simple familiar setup is actually made worthwhile in this amusingly raunchy comedy four friends from los angeles one soon to be married the other three his loyal groomsmen take a trip to las vegas to have the time of their lives and give the wouldbe groom a night hell never forget it actually turns into a night they all forget when they awake the next morning with a bad no recollection of what occurred the previous night and a series of misadventures that only grow stranger as they try to piece together the events of their wild bachelor party what initially sounds like a variation on the dreadful stoner comedy dude wheres my car actually produces some very clever results with more than enough vulgar and very funny gags appealing characters and a feelgood tone slow at first but the more out of control the jokes get the more laughs they produce even though it does arrive at an inevitable conclusion beyond that its wildly good fun ,comedy
i had to see this movie but could not help stopping at about 13rd when the movie shows the buttocks of an old man oh how funny to tease old peoplei am not used to watch this kind of american movies and i was shocked by the sexism the movie starts with a quick joke about gays admittedly i made these jokes too when i was 13 then you see pieces of women beautiful legs buttocks some breasts in bikini a girlfriend explicitly called a prostitute who does not like sperm a sexy girl on the street who thanks one of the main characters after a moderately obscene compliment on the street cause women like thati gave this movie 2 starts because i guess the detective part of the story where they try to discover the past night is original for this sort of movies,comedy
this is the funniest movie of 2009  there is not one character in this movie i feel anything other than indifference for  that is a bad thing for a comedy you have to laugh with the characters or in rare cases at the characters i did not laugh at all in this movie it leaves me cold granted there is a rather competent storyline which is why i still give it a six that and the decent acting but that and the story is wasted on crude jokes silly cameos obnoxious illogical behavior and just total weirdness go see pretty much any john hughes comedy from the eighties and you will find both the jokes and the heart missing from this movie,comedy
expecting a laugh riot after the huge buzz and the top rating here on imdb i was rather disappointed by this chucklefest the first smile didnt cross my face until about half an hour into the movie which is way too long for a comedy this movie consists of a rather uninspired plot without any really fresh ideas and of dialogue that seems mostly improvised the endless beauty shots of vegas also struck me as either needless runtimepadding or product placementthe solid efforts by the main cast make this one barely above averageimdb the 10line minimum on these reviews is really annoying,comedy
i m happy that this film is out of top 250 the top 250 is reserve for best films ever not movie like this is it funny yes then please watch really funny movies like httpwwwimdbcomtitlett0060123 httpwwwimdbcomtitlett0107048 httpwwwimdbcomtitlett0072431 httpwwwimdbcomtitlett0054068 and after id like to read your comments ive watched it last night and this film is not 8 but only 6 but rather 4 points what are the punch lines a missing teeth the chinese guy the cops car the tiger mike tysons punch the wedding come on so boring and so usa movie szasza hungary,comedy
first i have to say that i hoped everyone was right and this would really be a good comedy its notafter reading so much praise i was expecting originality of course there are some formulas every movie must follow but it must use it cleverly and in a way not used before they give us the conservative guy the adventurous guy and the insane guy did i forget the guy who is about to get married no the screenwriters did that he is boring in a boring waybut what do they do with the rest of the dudes not much vegas is good place for jokes and crazy stuff and we get both but is that enough i mean the jokes were nothing special and the crazy stuff well enchanted had crazy stuff as wellthis film never becomes bad nor good its mediocre all the way there is a torture scene and its completely pointless cruelty must be used with caution in a moviei would have given it a 6 but there was a something in the film that really annoyed me but other people probably wont mind nevertheless i think a lot of people will enjoy this picture especially with company,comedy
i went and watched this movie last night at the drive in along with the new terminator movie i went to basically see terminator and this was playing along side of ts i liked this movie more than i did terminatorwhen it first started i thought it was going to be a stupid comedy but i found myself laughing at quite a few different scenesthe only thing i didnt like was the pedophile jokes and the director should be ashamed for trying to find humor in adults having sex with minorsother than that it was a fun film i give it 5 stars out of 10,comedy
i expect one thing out of a raunchy comedy and that is to make me laugh this didnt i may have chuckled a couple of times if youre going to be offensive note offensive and raunchy are not synonymous at least make it funny the premise and resolution of the story was fun but its just not that great its baffling how this series is so popular,comedy
the is entertaining but its not as funny as everyone makes it out to be the movie plays a continual game of top that where the next piece to the puzzle has to be more outrageous than the previous one  and it gets kind of boring after awhile,comedy
i enjoyed it a lot forget the negative reviews  watch it and freshen your mind,comedy
i am probably in the vast minority of this movies fans by claiming i did not like this movie one bit and im standing firm with that beliefto start off i was forced to watch this movie with my family soon after it came out on dvd and it didnt really hold my attention for very long before i started to do other things anyways onto the review itself to be fair there was a few things in this movie i enjoyed for one i enjoyed the performances of the cast no complaint there i liked the set up for the movie and the cameo by mike tyson was indeed hilarious but thats where my enjoyment of this movie endsi cant really remember much about this movie except for the fact i didnt enjoy it it was lame stupid and pretty much went right over my head and i thought the idea with the guy they were looking for was on the roof the whole time was just plain idioticall in all i didnt really hate the movie i just didnt like it either and 3 stars for the performances and set ups and the cameo of mike tyson,comedy
ii is the funniest i comes second despite being the original iii is not funny at allhaving seen this movie twice now i can report that it is generally a lame and unbelievable film but one that succeeds in generating a stream of chuckles and the occasional guffawthe humour is generated almost completely by alan zach galifianakis and to a lesser extent by mr chow ken jeong stu ed helms is funny but some of his scenes are forced hes there to be the geeky normal guy who has abnormal things happen to him phil bradley cooper is there to add physical appeal magnetism and leadership to the group its an odd grouping but it works to a certain extentthis man movie is lowbrow escapist humour based on the absurd conceit that ordinary straight american white guys who lead rather boring lives are deep down wild party animals who do the funniest and most amazing things when they get wasted in vegasthe movie reflects the experience that most male moviegoers have had of getting wasted in their youth and doing stupid things it wasnt really stupid after all it was pretty cool sorry but throwing up on the lawn is not the same as stealing a tiger from mike tysonpart of the morality play at the heart of this movie is boys will be boys at a bachelor party and youre not really responsible for what you do if you got so wasted that you cant even remember it the title is misleading because the memory lapse doesnt come from alcohol but from ruphies most of us who have gotten wasted can unfortunately remember the stupid things we did at the end i was thinking that another part of this american morality play was this nothing must ever be allowed to disrupt the brides perfect weddingthis movie took almost an hour to set up the too long,comedy
i read the reviews about the and i thought at last a comedy motion picturemade in the usa that is actually funny  great i watched it last night its humour is very american which means it is not really funny for people with iqs over 99 bringing a brain dead x world champion boxerwho owns a tiger into a woeful film that relies heavily on crass humourwas the ace they had to play would it work no it only brings this down to another level there followed the 2then surprise surprise3 both much worse than the first pile of rubbish i am a huge fan of american comedy flicks like duck soupfor examplethis utter nonsense would have grouchoturning in his grave these daysrubbish like the makes a lot of money  so sad,comedy
i rented this movie with an open mind when it comes to movies my memory can be fuzzy and all i remember when this film was released was that it was about a trip travel and drug that went awfully wrong these characters had no redeeming qualities whatsoever i suspect that the films subtext is what the story is really about rather than the sophomoric antics that initially give the movie a comedic flairfor starters alan zach galifianakis is a registered sex offender whose sister is getting married to doug justin bartha the groom he even tries to make a pass at his unreceptive future brotherinlaw doug doug suggests that a sexual relationship with alan would be borderline incestuous and politely declines there are scenes that suggest that alan is into bestiality is bisexual and a drug addict with ties to drug dealers doug is the insipid nice guy who reluctantly accepts alan into his circle of friends stu ed helms is a nerdy and spineless dentist with an oedipus complex his relationship with melissa is that of mother and son not future husband and wife out of all the men stu lost it the most during their drug and alcohol trip he married a local stripper with a newborn and is very quick to turn his back on the morals he pretends to uphold phil bradley cooper is the quintessential pretty boy who is a douchebag he is a grade school teacher who fathered a child with a married woman phil hates his job as a teacher and for the most part has no soul his attitude really irked me because there are many men who are that way hes the ringleader of the pack even though stu and doug are the ones with the money id say phil has the makings of a hustler he pretends to know it all yet knows nothing and is more than willing to use your assets to make this possiblethe scenes with mike tyson are crazy theres a lot of symbolism in his role the men literally chase the tiger slang for cocaine use tyson a man with a troubled history plays the role of an avowed animal lover the band of brothers in reference to alans failed blood brother ceremony atop the roof behaved more like animals than the ones tyson keeps by the way he was gently cradling a french bulldog at homemr chow is highly stereotyped as an effeminate chinaman with small chinese balls who is also a homosexual his presence was troubling and it was not due to his orientation the only reason why i gave this movie 3 stars was because of the beautiful images of las vegas the cinematographys lovely in these scenesoverall my impression of this movie seems to be a closer look into the relationships of bachelors and the dark secrets that they keep it feels like more of a black comedy if one looks at the film from this perspective,comedy
do not shooti still gave it 8 out of 10the second one was ridiculous since it was so similar even if that was the point and the fact they are making a third is beyond ludicrous just trying to suck in the sheep to make a quick buck the script will probably suck but i wont judge till i see itback to this one i saw it opening night with little expectations i only really knew of bradley cooper from hes not that into you the dick from wedding crashers and a cult horror film yes man midnight meat trainthis was clearly coopers time to shine after this he went on to do thinks like date anniston appear in limitless and oscar nominated movie which was great silver linings playbook two movies with my favorite actor de niro to bootya know this was my sisters favorite comedy at the time right after she saw it claiming it was the funniest movie ever it did not end theremy brother saw it 6 times in the theater he never does that at all so he must of liked it obviously it really helps me and my friends just stayed at caesers palace the year before i saw this and i am from canada and do not travel a lot what was also cool was i went to vegas a month after opening night of this film once again and stayed at mgm and every time i passed by palace i thought of the filmi do no think this is as funny as superbad knocked up horrible bosses or even 40 year old virgin and of course my favourite comedy the big lebowski by the legendary coen brothers if you enjoyed the movies i just named perhaps you will agree that this movie is arguably close but not better then what i named well maybe it is right on par with bosses i like to class this movie in the likes of classic comedies like there is something about mary or meet the parentsgreat fun just not the funniest movie of the decade like some claim,comedy
the is one of the best dumb movies i have watched in a long time it is clearly superior to the six or seven other recent comedy films i have watched dated from 2009 to 2012the plot is pure nonsense but it is executed quite brilliantly overall a very funny movie and one that should be watched once but never twice the fun of these dumb comedies comes from the jokes which are not funny in a second round recommended for everyone but doesnt expect anything artistically sound in terms of artistic value i would rate this about 310 but since it doesnt try to be art it deserves the high score i gave it at least this is anything but pretentious,comedy
i dont think i ever burst out laughing during the duration of the film giggled yes but never pissing myself laughing like i expected on the account of many reviewsthe is engaging to say the least but i wouldnt slap comedy on it but of course its a comedy and this can only result in me saying that this film does a miserable job at attempting to make you laugh the grizzly beard zach fellow is quickly becoming one dimensional in the land of hollywood and even judging the art work of future films that star him on dvd covers you know how hes going to bejuvenile humour which isnt a bad thing as such humour can be disguised behind matured characters and conversations is what this film is the only credit i can give it is that it was engaging and never lost its grip on the plot but it simply fails at making you laugh,comedy
well first off this was a lot funnier than i was expecting its a simple story of four friends well sort off who go to las vegas for one of their stag nights but after being slipped something they lose their memories of the night as well as the groom and find a trail of destruction left in their wake including a baby a tiger and stolen police carthis who done it scenario is played to comic effect quite well but theres nothing to justify the films reputation its funny in parts and the performances are quite believable as the bazaar situations play out but in the end the final is pay off doesnt work for me being somewhat of an any climax but having said that it does try to deliver a message or two about relationships and has its moments but overall i wanted more comedy and less moralising whilst trying to be as gross as possiblenot half bad though,comedy
the to some is a masterpiece to others it is another pile of crude sex jokes that is american comedy the reason for this in my opinion is the result of years and years and countless numbers of low budget cheesy and low quality comedy movies you have probably seen on comedy central the on the outside seems to be this but if one digs deeper into the movie they will discover that it is indeed a remarkable movie including the quest of 4 men all possessing unique traits to have as much fun they can have before doug gets married it is all a matter of perception before i saw this movie i expected another one of those fewlaugh crappy movies shown on tv practically 2 weeks after the release i assure this is not the case however some say this movie is the best of all comedies well this is definitely not agreeable to most avid movie fans especially ones above the age of 18 this reaction is because of the number of moviegoers who have not been exposed to some of the earlier greater comedy works instead they have been exposed to the cheesy and low quality works with little or no effort to organize a reliable plot as well as other movie needs it is instead stuffed with stupid and outofdate punchlines and tasteless humor to arouse a younger audience who will pay for a movie ticket to get some cheap thrills think of this movie as a breath of fresh air to the disasters in comedy in the past 5 years,comedy
against my better judgment i decided to see this film because of the success of its sequel and the high ratings here surely if a sequel was made for a film then the original film mustve been good enough to warrant that right well no it wasnt i shouldve remembered the resident evil and scream series they just keep pumping these out dont theyanyway i cant say i was disappointed i pretty much got what i expected a bunch of guys getting together to do something wildly stupid so that we could laugh at them ok i was hoping for more because of the success of the sequel but unfortunately that was it it was about as funny as watching some guys trying to tip a cow in the words of seth from superbad thats not even cleverthis film couldve been funny and the jokes sound funny on paper but on film they werent i mean an image of some guys waking up from their stupor to find themselves in the middle of a disheveled room with a chicken and a tiger and no clue as to what theyve done does sound funny so why wasnt it probably because there was no chemistry among the main characters it was just a group of individuals experiencing unusual circumstances i felt nothing for themthe only time i actually laughed was during that scene where the bearded guy was playing with the baby that was roughly 20 minutes into the movie and that was pretty much the only really funny though somewhat vulgar and tasteless scene the rest of the time i was only interested in finding out how the movie would end i didnt find much humor in this film but it did keep me interested enough to finish watching it which is why im giving it a 7,comedy
comedy is a hard genre its really hard to find talented comedy actors that make us laugh without feeling empty in doing it im not talking about the easy laugh of an arranged false situation where you just laugh at the awkwardness of the scene true comedy is closer to true drama than to anything else thats what i think but once in a while one can find a decent comedy that succeeds in the performances more rare is to watch something that does something interesting on the narrative level this is the casethe performances are standard routine in what concerns todays physical acting and word timing this is the part of the thing that usually gets outdated so soon so i suspect that in 15 years well no longer laugh at the phrasing timing or even most of the written jokes zach galifianakis is the exception he acts really funny because hes the only character who doesnt act to be funny he doesnt force his comic act into the audiences he stands outside the comic forces of the film quite literally as his character is an alien forced upon the well acquainted group so he just stands there and there resides the fun of his performancethe nice thing here is done on the narrative structure of the thing the story is about a group of guys who dont remember what happened the night before drugs booze etc they are given clues the baby the tiger the police car which are the links to those unremembered events following those leads in a sort of a twisted detective story mechanics they will be able to retell the events they dont remember so the narrative structure is that these characters will reveal a story that has already happened to them this is a fun concept and a clever device and it is really rare to find clever structures applied to mainstream comedywell the unveiling of the missing puzzle pieces of their night is not as great as it might have been the mike tyson episode is forced upon the narrative probably there to include tyson and sell some more tickets with his presence but it just feels out of place a scene from another movie but overall this is okmy opinion 35httpwww7eyeswordpresscom,comedy
the is one of those movies which doesnt live up to the standards suggested by all the breathless hype its rather overrated most definitely not one of the funniest movies ever made as so many of its ardent fans would suggest it to be its an ok movie no more no less it has a smart interesting setup but the setup proves to be better than the execution you get the sense a lot of truly hilarious things happened over the time frame of the story but we never actually see those things we missed the debauchery and saw only the aftermath it was an interesting premise having the characters try to piece together what happened during the night of madness they cant remember but it feels like we missed the good stuff and what were left with isnt enough to compensate its a movie which has its moments but what should have been the best moments are pretty clearly the moments we never seethe story surrounds a wild crazy bachelor party doug is the groom his wedding a mere two days away when he his two best friends and his bridetobes rather strange brother head to vegas note to future grooms going to vegas two days before your weddingbad idea the movie opens on the morning of the wedding with one of the friends calling the bride to deliver the bad news they cant find doug flash back a couple of days and we see the gang of four preparing for their excursion we see the drive from california to vegas their arrival in sin city and a toast to a night theyll never forget and then its the next morning and all hell has broken loose and doug is gone and none of the other three can remember a thing and theres a tiger in the bathroomtheres the tiger and a chicken a police car and a mattress impaled on a statue theres a baby and a stripper a naked asian man and a former heavyweight champion of the world how do all these things tie together what the heck happened last night and where is doug our gang now down to three begins a seemingly futile attempt to make sense of the madness as they try to piece together the puzzle were treated to some laughs but not nearly as many laughs as this movies reputation would suggest the movie just is not consistently funny enough its very hit and miss and while the setup sounds like it makes room for all kinds of outrageous stuff the movie actually ends up being much more tame than you would think the fact that the three main characters are as a group rather bland doesnt help the characters of phil and stu played by bradley cooper and ed helms respectively are pretty much straight men there to play off the really funny characters and thats where the brides brother alan played by zach galifianakis comes in hes clearly meant to be the most memorable character the wacky strange outlandish funnyman but while hes clearly funnier than the other two the character doesnt make as much of an impression as he really needs to for the movie to be as riotously funny as it promised to be supporting players on the screen for only a few minutes here and there really outshine the three central characters and thats a problem the is the story of one wild night but its one wild night which the audience missed out on much of the funniest stuff the film has to offer doesnt come until the closing credits have begun to roll and by then its much too late not a bad movie but one which has a reputation which far exceeds its actual quality,comedy
the is basically about four dudes who go to vegas for a bachelor party but things dont go as they planned i have to admit i had some few laughs in the film but it showed nothing original or different from what weve already seen after the first night in vegas they forget everything they did last night because they have mistakenly taken rohypno instead of an ecstasy from there on all the scenes were about three of them looking for the other missing dude and all we have is a memory of dude wheres my car with older guys and another town but at least the movie was good at showing true friendship among men and the problems we have to face with our wives therefore i found no reason to watch the again or recommend but will surely watch with friends after some beers,comedy
i cant exactly remember who recommended this on to me maybe i was drugged but i cant say i was overly impressed im not a huge fan of american comedies anyway sorry guys i just dont get your sense of humour so i guess that wasnt the best start i found many things i didnt like about the but its not all bad there were one or two good things but more of that later heres a short synopsis firstdoug is getting married and as is the tradition he and his friends phil stu and the brides brother alan are off on a bachelor party in las vegas the evening starts off well with impromptu drinks on the roof of caesars palace but from then on it gets kind of messed up phil stu and alan wake up the following morning in their hotel room there is no sign of doug and theres a tiger in the bathroom they also find a baby in a closet its now a race against time to piece together the events of the previous evening so they can find doug and get him to the wedding on the way we discover amongst other things that they stole a police car stu got married to a dancer called jade and a chinese man called mr chow is after them for some reason throw in an appearance from mike tyson and thats your movie folks do they ever find doug what do you think i guess its not too hard to figure outunfortunately a lot of comedy filmmakers decide to make the characters so much larger than life that they just become gross parodies of themselves for example the character phil is a teacher who is married with a son he steals money from the kids in his class to finance his trip to vegas to me thats reprehensible behaviour but to some people thats just funny so i found the humour in this film was pretty well wide of the mark to put it mildlyok so what was good about it i thought the cameo by heather graham as jade was good and i found ken jeong as mr chow very funny other than that theres not much to recommend the performances of the main cast were ok but the loathsome characters and the mindless plot just left me cold i know there are a lot of people out there that may disagree with me on this one but not recommended imomy score 5310,comedy
we know that this movie won a golden globe for the best comedy we also know that young people  probably mostly guys  about to get married or those who just got married find this film really cool and quite funny we even laughed and thought some parts were quite creative and amusing however we cant really recommend that you spend 96 minutes with this movie unless of course you just want to chill out and fantasize a bachelor party  out on the town in las vegas the premise here is that 4 guys probably from la take a car ride to vegas because one of them is getting married in a few days they get wasted and drugged when three of them wake up in their hotel suite they cant remember what happened the previous night find a tiger and a baby in the room but the groom to be is missing and that is not the half of it  the three guys  ed helms zach galifianakis and bradley cooper bounce all over las vegas trying to find their buddy and they end up finding out a couple of other things that they have no idea had happened to them while they were whacked out of their minds maybe at least one of the characters discovers something worthwhile about himself that he didnt realize before unless this theme is really up your alley we suggest that you pass on it,comedy
this movie is hard to evaluate it has some very good points but it is not as great as it might sound its just good the story is creative with weird and curious mysteries to be unveiled although not at a slow pace the film goes at a slower pace than it should considering the various things happening most mysteries are explained but the things done by the characters are not believable most things that are supposed to be funny are just plain dummy so in the end this is a pretty average work its well produced as expected from a hollywood movie an average movie with a creative story all i can say is that they wasted a good opportunity to make a great movie,comedy
the follows three amnesiac groomsman the day after a bachelor party as they track down the origins of a series of clues that they hope lead them to the lost groom doug justin bartha the main attraction for this movie was mike tysons cameo role and i didnt expect much from this movie zach galifianakis character alan garner was the best part of the film for me overall i feel this is a furiously paced and inventive take on a triedandtested formula an exemplary bromantic comedy that doesnt sacrifice heart in pursuit of laughs this movie is not an all time great comedy however if you have spare time you should check it out,comedy
i was expecting to laugh a lot since this movie got such good reviews in the theater but i didnt laugh once it was ok but i didnt find it funny the film is about 4 guys going to vegas a couple of days before one of them doug is about to get married one of them alan buys some drugs and puts it in their drinks it turns out to be roophies so the foursome dont remember what happened in the morning they wake up and soon to be groom doug is missing so the other 3 try to track down what they did the previous night it involves a baby stripper tiger chinese dude looking for his money and mike tyson finally one of them guesses where doug might be then they have to get back in time for the weddingfinal verdict some what entertaining but i was disappointed still worth checking out since so many people thought it was better than me,comedy
the is about four guys who go to vegas for a bachelor party in all recent comedy fashion and just what you would expect from the title these guys wake up after having spent a night of being blown out of their minds in vegas unfortunately one of the guys is missing and they start out on a terribly misguided adventure to find out where he isso in other words the follows the formula of dude wheres my car with comedy that is overall more shocking and less about stupid comedy and more about shock comedy if you can let yourself go for a little while and try not to think about the thousands of moral implications brought on by the storyline then youre liable to enjoy some good dirty fun and one of the funniest comedy movies this centuryunfortunately there are some down sides this movie really is only about the misadventures brought about by their actions from the night before nothing deep or meaningful here while you do have to let yourself go every once in a while its a shame the movie didnt take more of a shot at the corrupt morals it takes to ruin your life in vegas and simply promotes sin citys decadence of stupid young twenty something lifestyle being played out by mid thirty aged actorsthat being said the actors do a great job the shining role here is played by zach galifianakis as the brother of the bride and his lines of really screwed up shock comedy rather than every other actor in the movie ultimately the second best actor is the guy you see the least of the groomthe is good for some nice not so clean fun basically it is what it sells and that is what every other aftertheparty comedy sells and thats decadence in a lifestyle that really isnt that great still let yourself go and youll find some belly busting laughter several times at this movie,comedy
from the beginning i kept getting the feeling that the movies story and laughs were due to kick in any minute right around the corner about to happen in the next scene this never happenedi did manage to force a laugh once or twice and the plot kept me interested to watch to the end but it was a bit of a chore the only character with any depth and realism was the dentist the other lead actors did not have enough substance in order to draw humour out of the situations they were planted ini think this is a brand of american humour which is not to my taste though i can see why it would appeal to some other tastes its very much about exchanges of 1liner insults so if you find this funny the movie will probably appeal south park come to mind as a similar genre and perhaps going back a while movies like caddyshack or smokey and the banditfor me disappointing,comedy
todd phillips the is a concept comedy that presumes the idea of being so drunk you cant remember the night before is inherently hilarious and so relies on the absurdity of its constituent scenes for big laughs its essentially a free pass for comedic situations and the film feels all the more disappointing because of ityou know the premise four friends trek to vegas for a bachelor party theyll never forget cue the irony they wake up in their suite the next morning to find the room trashed a baby in their closet a tiger in the bathroom and doug justin bartha the groomtobe missingthe wants to be a character comedy but our remaining three protagonists are too transparently archetypical to ever compellingly drive the film you have stu ed helms the highstrung nerdy dentist with a bitchy girlfriend you know hes gotta dump alan zach galifianakis the fat weird one whose oddball antics often feel forced and phil bradley cooper the selfloathing elementary school teacher and leader of the packthe films biggest woes are in its payoffs spoilers ahead phil says he hates his life he pays for the trip to vegas with bogus field trip money conned from his students but its never addressed thereafter and when he returns to his wife and child by the films end hes been inexplicably changed by the experience stu has it out with his bitchy girlfriend but it doesnt become the debilitating powershift that the film or the characters deserve worst of all its clearly established in the first act that dougs stepfathers borrowed car is to be handled with extreme care so when the crew speeds to the wedding with the beaten heap of the cars remains we expect a climactic explosion that never comes its bottomline lazy comedy writingbut ultimately the movie wasnt written for snobs like me it is its premise if the phrase people act dumb when theyre drunk sounds like an anthem to you youll likely to enjoy the film phillips has crafted here comedy is the most subjective film genre to the point where even theater experience and conditions play a large factor in etching an opinion the monday midafternoon crowd of twenty may not have been the best litmus test for the successfulness of the films gags though the audience did laugh more frequently than i didstill the has some inexcusable story problems clichd protagonists and if youll pardon the expression a forgettable story recalling some of my favorite recent comedies sideways a mighty wind last years tropic thunder the stories are just as successful as the jokes and if im not laughing im engaged the is certainly good for a few chuckles but offers little of substance beyond that more akin to a standup comedy routine than a credible piece of visual storytelling,comedy
i wouldnt say i outright hated itbut i dont think it deserves the hype it has gotten but it has its momentsthe the newest feature comedy from todd phillips has hit the scene although i am a year behind in getting to this my super busy schedule has kept me from seeing films as much as i would likei thought the film had some good moments and some fun moments but there wasnt any great moments not at least until the end credits rolled and i dont mean that as a snide against the film in that the end credits rolling is the best thing but it is because of what is contained within the end credits those moments are what i felt should have occurredi will say bradley cooper was aptly cast and did an excellent job in fact the 3 leads were mixed appropriately i just think they needed a bit stronger mass of materiali hope what occurs in the credits is what makes up the sequel when it films but as of right now i would merely suggest it if you have nothing better to watch that night,comedy
i enjoyed this daft comedy well enough but it isnt the funniest film to recently come out of hollywood  in fact it would probably struggle to make it into the top three even though it serves up a regular supply of laughs i suppose thats the trouble with funny trailers  they tend to be a doubleedged sword because they draw the people into the cinema but fail to achieve the level of laughs suggested by the trailer that many might expect the film follows the misadventures of a group of average guys on the stag night of one of them who goes missing following a night that none of them can remember the guys wake up in their trashed penthouse villa with monster s and discover a tiger in the bathroom and a baby in a cupboardi liked the fact that the guys here werent sexcrazy teens but thirtysomethings with the attendant baggage a few more years under the belt inevitably brings even though it fails to sidestep some clichd situations the film goes out of its way to undermine preconceived notions the funny cops are also sadistic and vindictive the outwardly respectable girlfriend is a foulmouthed harridan who cheats on her partner while the seasoned vegas stripperescort is a sweet girl mike earbiter tyson who i feel comfortable saying is looking decidedly porky these days seeing as he is more than an oceans distance away from me as i type this is a good guy the vicious villain is camp and weedy and so on its no doubt a strategy to keep things fresh and it works for the most part the four friends make a likable bunch even as they bicker and fight and the mystery at the core of the film means that the pace only occasionally flags,comedy
why this movie have so high rate one of the most idiotic brainless boring movie i have ever seen forced humor followed with very bad acting which make me feel like idiot just for watching it i cant remember one scene that make me laugh for example scene in the bathroom when fat guy pee beside toilette or his speech at the roof when cuts his palm or mike tyson and his tiger or  who laugh at that why do people make this kind of movie and who is a target group its not even for 10 years old kids ps 1 is to big grade for this if there were negative points ill surely will give 1 the worst spent 130 min of may time,comedy
i actually thought that this movie was going to be really really funny i loved todd phillips gg allin documentary and his other feature comedies were great but this was one tired clich after another just some ill conceived hour and a half long drunk joke that teetotalers think is funny because theyre to spineless to have any real funperhaps by now you may have realized that im an alcoholic as i was watching this i could not for the life of me believe that phillips and everyone else involved were this incredibly unimaginative vegas marrying hookers with golden hearts even the vegas tourist board is more creative the plain fact is the movie was one of the most tired and flat films ive ever seen even my exwife knew that the boys night out stupidness in the movie was dumbly written and unimaginative a big problem there are literally thousands of other places to go that are more interesting than thisbut then again i guess that alkies are more comfortable at a safe naive distance we like our lushes to do the same thing they did in the bugs bunny cartoons 50 years ago on the way out one 40 something woman remarked that the end credits made the characters even more moronic that she previously thought then the idiot took out a bottle of pharms and popped it must be nice to be able to do that without fear of social reprisalthis movie was made for all the fbla cretins that spent roughly a month drinking in college and talk about it every chance they get for the rest of their lives steer clear if you have ever had an original thought it would be a shame to waste the brain cells,comedy
lemme explain first of all i dont understand why people love this movie this much and i also dont understand why others hate it so much it just dont worth the big fight over it its just a 80 minute goofaround i watched in now i finished like 10 minutes ago and if someone would ask me to tell himher what happened in it i surely would miss some details cuz i already dont remember everything it was ok while it lasted but its not likely i will remember any of it in a few daysthe asian bad guy was not funny all the scenes he is in are extremely unnecessary annoying and uncool the stripper the dentist married was cute and likable but she had no real purpose or at least a good line to begin with she was just there to show that the nerdy dentist can be a man too the broom and the bride were dull they had like 10 lines in the whole movie combinedthe scene where they mixed doug with a black doug was the lowest point completely unnecessary and unfunny too actually i felt embarrassed for that scene it was so bad and poor guy who needed to play the wrong doug he was only there to have one more wow look how stupid that man is haha character in the moviealans character was ok at least in my opinion he had the best moments in this flick but the bloodbrother scene went to far in that one he felt more creepy than funny and i dont think it was meant to be that waythe had its moments but even so i expected much more cuz i was fooled by the hype bad movie no sire golden globe winner movieyou got to be kidding meaverageness all around,comedy
its not often a frattype comedy only this time with adults enjoys the financial success or peer recognition and theres no doubt there was  is about this particular movie so with my interest piqued i settled down to an expected laughfestonly to be a little let down and underwhelmed by what i sawin its favour it boasts las vegas as its principal location backdrop an engaging cast of mostly unknowns and a plot which resembles if distantly that of memento only with a comic twist as our three intrepids seek to retrace their steps the morning after a particularly heavyduty drugfuelled night before which sees them lose their erstwhile buddy on his stag night a good deal of the comedy borders on the surreal taking in a callgirl and her baby who gets hitched vegasstyle to the putupon dental doctor an oriental crimelord who wants his casino winning restored in return for their kidnapped buddy and unbelievably washed up boxer iron mike tyson and entourage including his pet tiger all the missing gaps are restored to the guys in a clever montage of still photographs as the titles roll as the groom gets just to his wedding on timeits all performed with great gusto to an almost everpresent modernday soundtrack and i can certainly see how the film would take with thirtysomethings and under being myself however much the wrong side of thirty or forty come to that i found the humour just too broad and slapdash for me going by the movies boxoffice take many millions of cinemagoers and from the high average mark a great majority of imdb reviewers obviously beg to differ but at least i was spared the totalgrossout experience i feared at the outset,comedy
just before his wedding a man and his three friends go to vegas a land of adventure where anything can happen and in this movie anything does happen youll never believe so much can go so wrong in such a short time how will the friends be able to recover from such a seemingly disastrous night i had heard some positive buzz on the from a variety of people and figured why not watch it and i will say that while im glad i did its not quite on a par with other comedies despite several humorous and outrageous moments the first twenty minutes is a bit slow and although it quickly recovers i just didnt end up feeling as entertained as i had hoped when it was all over maybe the characters werent lovable or something i dont know i see this films popularity declining in a year or two id much rather watch slackersdont get me wrong the cop car bit is hilarious the asian guy from community is pretty cool and the tiger well theres a tiger in fact my favorite part is ed helms song about the tiger sometimes referred to as tiger snooze though the actual title is unknown to me oh and a holocaust ring my biggest complaint is heather graham while she does fine i just never cared for graham and i heard that the part was offered to lindsay lohan i much prefer lohan and its a part that could have helped her collapsing career oh wellif you like old school and wedding crashers this is probably your sort of film i dont mind those but its not really my favorite and this isnt exactly the same  its not will ferrell its not judd apatow but the trend in comedies these days is going in a direction i dont necessarily appreciate as others do i cant pinpoint it,comedy
im surprised to see that this movie rates 80 at the time im writing this not surprising is that aged under 18 gave the highest scores because thats the perfect target group for this kind of movie if you havent seen a whole lot of good comedies in your life yet this will be funny however if youve seen more movies it will be all too obvious that the main ingredients of this movie are derivative andor cheapthe doctordentist gag comes straight out of wild hogs for instance and many of the other situations come from other movies which in most cases did a better job at it for someone who has watched fear  loathing in las vegas it feels like the makers of this movie wanted to duplicate the hotel suite scene but were too chicken pun intended to do actual damage to their film set when the humor isnt derivative it often stoops down to puerile level insteadthis is a trailer movie the best parts are in the trailer and the rest is mostly filler dont get me wrong its not terrible as a whole as a kind of remix of existing movies it was entertaining enough not to get me bored it just doesnt deserve the 10 or even 8 stars many people give it 610 seems much more reasonable,comedy
i seriously dont know why this is rated so up first annoying thing this is full of radiotoplist music though its good music i cant find a single spot with something happening and without music that i heard 5 times earlier on radio this week i think peoples reactions is one of the most important things in movies are those realistic and well acted well those wasnt realistic and events of the film wasnt so realistic neither so they somehow borrowed some gambling money from  funny  chinese guy if they won with the money then they should return 100 of winnings okeey this movie is full of unrealistic things but i cant say this wasnt entertaining not boring whatsoever not a must see but worth of watching610,comedy
i thought this was a decent movie and i do like zach whatever his last name is normally he doesnt have to be foul to be funny why do so many movies have so much foul language and such hey i dont mind a little to be realistic in my opinion many of the movies would be just as funny if not more so without so much of it its like they throw the f word just for a few more laughs has the opposite effect on me the scenes with the baby were not necessary i think it would have been funnier if they had tried not to say so many as in a few scenes as for the plot line i enjoyed it it did have me wondering what was going to happen next also as in previous posts the asian guy was a bit over the top i was not overly impressed with this movie the previews made it look funnier than it actually was i have no intention of watching it again,comedy
not as good as old school the is an okay movie but falls short of the gold standard the cast was not as strong as in old school one can tell who in the script of the would be wil vince and luke too old and expensive is the old cast from old school the script in the is funny in spots but they showed the best moments in the trailer i liked the movie but the is more of rental i would give the film a six or seven out of ten one sees some of the cast from old school in the and few of the old school gags were added into the film i think they were paying homage to the classic old school,comedy
this movie made me laugh even at times when i didnt fully understand why so for that i am grateful  got my moneys worth i look forward to the dvd with its deleted scenes etc the central trio of the movie are such a sad sack bunch of losers they really look funny without having to say or do anything i also appreciated some of the supporting characters heather graham who deserves better parts the asian dude who sparked up events  even mike tyson who i normally would not like at all plus the baby carlos who was so cutei liked the ending especially with the series of photographs which goes a long way to explain what happened,comedy
this movie certainly is a funny comedy and deserves to be the comedy of the summer since no other film in its genre has yet to compete with its series of humorous events but having said that this movie seems to have gained a buzz that has transformed into a drunken mania filled with several wtf and omg moments with quirky characters this film leaves many reminiscing on their own drunken experiences with a great since of nostalgia and a thirst for their own crazy nights in fact most members of the audience leave with one comment amongst their friends we need to go to vegas but behind the series of unfortunate and humorous events when one analyzes the in sobriety its not hard to see that its much like the movie dude wheres my car but with a bigger budget perhaps when this movie is available for households and viewed far from the friends who remember those nostalgic party nights some of the hysteria will fade and sobriety will set in,comedy
this movie makes freddy got fingered look like a sunday school recital this flick is sick to the nines i was surprised they let this movie slide with just an r rating there were times i thought an nc17 would have been more suitable do not watch this with anybody under 18 i really mean that for this particular movieas far as the content goes i thought the filmmakers were extraordinarily creative making the the main plot and having the audience piece together the wild night through the dialogue presented throughout the movie this is a pulp fictionesquire approach i very much appreciated as unique and stylish for a raunchy comedy the actors are decent but the standout was the fat jesus alan who does his damndest to be a bizarre naive simpletonmanchild he seemed to have taken his cues from chris elliots chris peterson on get a life reverend jim ignatowsky from taxi and a little bit of kelly bundy im all for innocent mondo bizarro menchildren in comedy movies though alan seemed a little bit meanspirited compared to chris peterson he looked an awful lot like torgo from manos the hands of fate and seemed just as perverted hes the highlight of the film though hes not quite as good as chris elliot or peewee herman playing the weird manchild characterhonestly the best stuff was in the previews the mike tyson cameo was a bit of a letdown heather graham plays a standardissue whore with a heart of gold that weve seen a bazillion times the asian gangster was just weird i thought the kids tazing our intrepid heroes was not that funny overall a decent comedy with a notable manchild character but its a far cry from cabin boy wait for the dvd to come out and just rent it for a few days dont bother buying this sucker,comedy
this is a revised review of this movie i originally gave it a 9 but after the hype and rewatching this movie my views have changed afterall the true test of a movie is timedont get me wrong i loved this movie the first time i saw it but unlike other comedies tommy boy old school happy gilmore etc this movie doesnt have replay valuethe initial shock of the photos was epic for me in the theaters but it lost a lot of weight after knowing they were coming when i watched it on dvdgreat 1st time watch below average 2nd,comedy
worth watching i believe if the cast was made up ofpaul rudd  jack black robert downey jr and steve carell and the director  writer  and producers were better  then this movie couldve been one of the funniest movies of the decadethe writers and director totally suck they didnt utilize mike epps or heather graham at all they could have given them way better lines and more of themthe reason this movie is so highly regarded is because the premise is great and the potential is massive its a let down because the writer and director didnt do a good job the actors did their parts very well  but they were limited because of the poor producing i dont normally trash people like this but im so angry at the missed opportunity with this movie i almost felt like this about oldschool  but this was a terrible miss its like the underdog everyone is rooting for getting to the superbowlwinning at half time and then losing the game 355 if someone else made it 65,comedy
this is a good movie not great but good the movie has an offbeat story with an interesting twist almost like a whodunit except that here its a what happened although the story has its amusing moments it is not uproariously funny actually the movie worked better when showing how three fellows are following up on all kinds of strange and weird clues to figure out what happened to them there is a lot of slap stick reminiscent of the three stooges and if you like the three stooges style of comedy then this movie will make you laugh the funniest character is the chinese guy played by ken jeong whose acting is definitely over the top and is a scene stealer the three lead characters are amusing but do not come close to generating anything approximating a real loud guffaw the best part of the movie are the end credits which says something about the celluloid that preceded it,comedy

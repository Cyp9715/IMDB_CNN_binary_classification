  lots of laughsfunny funny funny  and thats coming from a nonfangreat performances here in this blend of comedy and high flying action  stephen chow as sing packs one hell of a kick  his chemistry with ng man tat golden leg is natural as it is in most of their films together plus sings shaolin brothers provide for a lot of comic relief  from their training to the championship game there are really cool shots a mix of matrixcrouch tiger special effects and it delivers  oh and vicki zhao literally steals this in the end you have to see itthe bruce lee goalie scene is priceless  this movie can definitely be watched several times with even more satisfaction,comedy
wow i was really surprised by this movie it is totally unique ive never seen anything else like it there is a very charming love story and the effects are really cool the idea of combining with is very original even though its so bizarre youll find yourself asking why nobody has done anything like this before i laughed constantly throughout this movie and went out and bought it a few days after i first saw it i would recommend it to everyone i know this is the best asian comedy since the heyday of jackie chan and fighting benny go see it buy it whatever just make sure you do see this filmi would be surprised if there is not a sequel this film should have been released theatrically in the us ive heard miramax handled it sorry guys you lost millions of dollars this film would have been a smash hit they probably just didnt think that would sell in america but word of mouth would have sold this movie very well,comedy
or the funniest movie ive seen this decade i was expecting a moderate little asian comedy worthy about an imdb 7 tops but at the end i was forced to give this 9 points see no other comedy has actually brought me to tears laughing in recent history either mr chow is a genius or hes one lucky sonova see just happens to press all the right buttons and in right places in the little relief spots its as dramatic as its supposed to be and the rest its big big big laughs all the way highly recommended ps if you dont like this movie your heart must be made of stone and you have absolutely no sense of humour my condolences,comedy
throughout the nearly two hour running time of this movie the room was a glow with merriment excitement and remarks of holy crap that is the coolest thing ever  indeed for this movie is filled with amazing visuals fantastic fun and all around goodness  is a harmless movie the type that mentions the normal morals you might find in a childrens movie work in teams dont let success go to your head cheating is bad etc without preaching themsome shaolintrained but for the most part poor and unhappy men get organized in a team with a coach who was crippled in a riot after losing the big game twenty years ago  youve got a variety of misfitsthe spunky youngn with the steel leg the obese convenience store clerk who can nearly fly the plutocratic salary man who uses a style reminiscent of flying chimpanzees cotton belly in wing chun  its an odd little band stretching from barelypost adolescent to nearly retirement age  this ragtag band is quite endearing and it works so wellsure there are a few instances of cheap humor but youve got to expect this  the visuals are fantastic the characterization competent even if you probably have seen the archetypes before and its a lot of fun whether its the parody of a war movie which my friend called scant instants before it happened or the somewhat unusual tribute to bruce lee hint its all in the sunglassesshould you see this movie  yes  id say this movie deserves 4 12 stars out of five based on technical merits etc  but on fun  thats right it gets a million billion stars  now lets see what miramax cut out25 minutes  crap,comedy
what a wonderful sports film stop read that line one more time i ask you to do this because you will probably never see this againthis was a sports film for me to say that it wasnt would be a bold faced lie this had all the characteristics of the modern hollywood sports film but what made it stand out and enjoyable is that it did not take itself seriously  and  it had some amazing cgi action sequences i recently watched a film called equilibrium where it was mentioned that it could rival the popularity of the matrix well i would have to say that perhaps this film siu lam juk kau would probably do more in toppling the king of bullettime cinematography than equilibrium would i was impressed from the beginning till the end of this movie the characters were all animated and individual in their own way there was time used to set them up and learn about each of them this wasnt one of those films where you spent most of your time with one of the characters then never really got to know the rest of them  you knew them all and couldnt wait to see what they were going to bring to the table next hong kong has crafted a spectacular film here they have taken the popularity of the bullettime effect and applied it to a genre that definitely needed a facelift i am surprised that america wasnt the first to do this but we are a nation that loves the standard sports film so why change what we love pwfsssst we are so lazy sometimessiu lam juk kau tells a spectacular story coupled with some amazing graphics to create a story about love teamwork and superpowers i also enjoyed the fact that this film also tried to say that is not an old topic that it can and should still be used in society today when we think of the martial arts films and physical aspect we see them as a very old and dated genre well let me be the first to say that they are coming back and coming back with a vengeance i enjoyed the fact that this was a revenge film so many of our films are revenge films i was happy to see that this one was not far off this film used techniques that i have not seen used in any other films they took the old skillful ways of the dated film added the work of bullettime and added the sports flare to it to create siu lam juk kau it had us laughing it kept us based in reality and it focused my attention to the screen for the entire film a task that no other sports film has been able to do i think that by having your star also direct it directed and starred stephen chow it builds upon a sense of comfortability with the story chow is a master of slapstick yet seldom overdoes the silliness choosing carefully timed gags and meticulously mounted visual construction over slapdash comedy the film is also no stranger to the bizarre with chows multiple homages to steven spielberg and a weird egg gag that im honestly shocked still remains the american cut of the pictureoverall siu lam juk kau is a amazing combination of comedy action romance and dazzling footage forming an irresistible package to those looking for something they havent seen before we see that it is a personal story that everyone is having fun being a part of that also helped this film  the characters really wanted to be in this film and it shined like the north star through our screen the dubbing which seemed off a couple times only added delight to this film chows siu lam juk kau is and will always be breathtakinggrade  out of ,comedy
stephen chow writes directs and stars in probably his funniest and most accessible to western audiences at least film to datesing chow is trying to find a way to encourage his countrymen to reembrace their shaolin heritage when he meets downatheel excoach fung ng the pair hatch a plan to form a team with sings shaolin brothers unfortunately these guys have lost their skills sing resolves to help his brothers regain their dignity then lead them into a championship showdown with the seemingly unstoppable evil team he also finds time to fall in love with taichi baker mui the usually lovely vicki zhao who gets some of the funniest scenes in the movieas a nonchinese speaker my experience with chows previous films is patchy his wordplay humour rarely making a decent transition to subtitles the comedy here though is mostly physical possibly even deliberately geared more towards a western market the plot  however clichd  is a pleasing tale of underdogs made good and the movie has a definite feelgood feel and uplifting ending even the cg is impressive and well used its the most entertaining movie ive seen in agesi was watching the universe dvd subs are decent enough without too many typos and the making of and other extras have english subs also,comedy
this has to be one of the goofiest dumbest strangest  and funniest  films ever made it made sound like a clich but you truly have to see this movie to believe it its that outrageous farout a slapstick film containing martial arts supernatural power and the sport of we get the usual misfitsmake good story which is nothing new but how it happens in unlike anything ive ever seen i cant recall how man times i literally laughed out loud watching these ludicrous scenes the climactic game at the nd got carried away of course but it was still fun to watchearlier in the story the bizarre dialog odd encounters with different characters and the humor is stupid many timesbut so stupid its comical i just shook my head in amazement at what i was seeing and hearing be prepared as i said for some incredible dumb things but also for much weird but definitely entertaining stuffnote i watched the short english theatrical version which runs 89 minutes you can also view the 112minute chinese version from what ive heard read and witnessed the 89 minute is sufficient any more of this insanity would be too much,comedy
after watching the deadly dull and self important road to perdition my friend and i needed a movie to cleanse our system shoalin is the perfect movie for that purpose i dare anyone to actually hate this movie the special effects are great all the performances are great and the movie doesnt take itself at all seriously i think the horrible translated subtitles actually improved the experience go evil team stephen chow is definitely a talent to watchmiramax please dont mess with this movie too much if you ever release this in america,comedy
this movie contains the traditional chineese fundamentals for a comedy pain humiliation cheap effects and serious over acting regardless of these facts it held me enthralled all the way to the end a truly funny and original film,comedy
this film was seen as something of a surprise having only heard of on the net and seen a teaser for the film i thought nothing more of it until given the opportunity to go and watch the uk release my initial disappointment with the dubbing i am a subtitle diehard was soon overcome with admiration of how far hk cinema has come imagine the fx expertise of the matrix with the comedy of jackie chan fused into a somewhat generic football film in a word a brilliantly scripted and often funny film many moments are extremely funny with the overthetop storyline made famous by hk and also the very touching moments with the acneridden baker girllove interest as she is only accepted for what she is it feels as if there is more to the love story in the original cut of the film as the story occasionally skipped in places like a bad dvd but the overall story is not affected it moves sedately at first which is good as the excessive use of and football are shown in increasingly ridiculous stages the final goal reminds me of hotshot hamish for those that read the comics worth seeing and i cant wait for the dvd  providing it has the original cut and subtitles,comedy
foreign movies are frowned upon by many american audiences whether it is because they are afraid of new ways of cinema xenophobia or the simple reason of not wanting to read the subtitles are among the reasons that seem to haunt them nonetheless there are some movies that overcome these obstacles and are widely acclaimed by all of the people alike i believe this is one of them despite its disparity with western comedy still does its job of conveying laughter to its viewers the story is original as well something that hollywood has not been able to come up in a very long time except for a few the story is not funny per se but what is wonderful about this movie is that each one of the characters is fully embraced by its respective actors for example the goalkeeper alluding the ever great bruce lee his facial expression and actions bring for a moment the late bruce lee to an audience that has been longing for his presence in the big screen bruce lee fans remember i am not saying that he is as great as bruce lee is but that his actions are reminiscent of him i applaud this funny yet intelligent movie with the hope that in the near future american audiences can widely appreciate other foreign movies more thank you very much for taking your time reading my review,comedy
ive seen this movie many many many many many  many times a friend recommended this to me and unfortunately thats still the only way people in europe know about this movie from mouth to mouth absolutely one of the most brilliant comedies ive ever seen must see wont tell anything else,comedy
is a film probably unlike you have ever seen it is goofy fun totally ridiculous but entertaining all the way through discussing the plot would be as silly as the film itself but i will say a couple of things to give you an idea the competition is in the hand of one man named hung yin tse he leads a team called team evil winning the competition every year now golden leg fung man tat ng a man made cripple by hung a long time ago ensembles his own team which exists out of shaolin fighters lead by sing stephen chow there is also a girl involved of coursewhat you can expect is a lot of fun and funny moments to give you an example sing can kick the ball so hard he can disable four opponents with one shot other can defy gravity the way the characters did it in crouching tiger hidden dragon from time to time the ball changes into a ball of fire causes strong winds or the earth to tremble of course the shaolin team will face team evil in the final game and of course it is a big surprise who will win what does it matter by then you have laughed a lot you have seen some pretty images you are really entertained,comedy
i dont remember who recommended this movie to me but im glad i watched it i first watched the american miramax version and loved it there were some things i didnt understand though specifically how miu became gorgeous which she was even with a bald head and how miu got into the final gameso the next night i watched the original version hoping there might be some explanations there werent the only explanation i can think of how miu became gorgeous is that someone told her she is beautiful so she became beautiful but how she got into the final game is still a mystery but it is just a mere detailanyway the reasons i liked the miramax cut better were that it cut out stuff that was not integral to the movie such as golden leg admiring mighty steel legs apartmentmiramax also cut the scenes of miu being friendly with the team and the scene in which miu stands up to her boss miu standing up to her boss was a great scene and let us see more of mius mastery however the boss not firing her after that was the most unbelievable thing in this movie of fantasy i think miramax did good to cut the scene so the movie would make a little more sense as to why miu still had a job before being fired for making salty and bitter bunsthe miramax cut also added special touches such as the signs being in english no peeing on the wall looked funnier to me than chinese characters did another addition to the miramax cut that i found to be a funny moment moreso than in the original version was the cellphone call iron shirt made during the final game in the original version he just called a girl to tell her he loved her in the miramax version he poured out his heart saying i love you only to find out he was talking to a man he then said something like please tell your wife what i just told you it was classicanyway all in all they were both very good versions so whichever one you get to see please see it,comedy
i just recently saw this movie with my father and brother and we couldnt stop laughing to be honest i think this is a very good movie asian movies are even better than many hollywood masterpieces this one in special has great fx a good sense of humor and the actors are great i recommend this movie if you like or if you wish to spend a very good time with your friends congratulations to chinese movie makers for this great and amazing film,comedy
the only reason i watched this film was my flatmate had had it recommended to him he spotted a copy in chinatown i was bored this evening the title the synopsis the box art etc were not promising i was expecting the usual cliched bmovie fallen star brings together ragtag gang of outsiders trains them up allowing them to bond and then usual finish beating the evil favourites right thats enough of the bad preconceptions this film is brilliant scuse the caps although the story is technically pretty cliched it is executed flawlessly and as other reviewers have mentioned  this is a comedy and a very funny one at that its not deep its not going to win an oscar  but i just sat through it with a great big grin slapped on my face laughing my arse off think escape to victoryjackie chanmatrix effects  actually the effects do deserve a mention id somehow got the idea that china was somehow going to produce crappy bluescreen special effects not at all true film is crammed with some very nice effects which are completely ott but add enormously to the overall impact of the film enough of my pointless rambling anyway please get a group of your mates round crack open a few beers and watch this film  i promise you you wont regret it,comedy
although the sports comedy genre is often plagued with clich and is usually only for the most strict of fans you definitely dont have to be a football fan to enjoy it helps if you enjoy the idea of a silly but not stupid or bad martial arts flickcompared to films of director stephen chows past king of comedy god of cookery is a much greater visual treat although hes not exactly from brilliant yet the direction has improved vastly and the new cg scenes are often amusing and visually interesting demanding repetitive viewingswhile the film is fun and generally smart it falls prey to a bit of an obvious story of course this is one of those littleplot highlaugh comedies one cant help be feel bogged down by some of the love plot which unlike a lot of the field action its totally predictable and at times is a boreif you must see be sure to watch it with its original language and subtitles the american english version had many of the films funniest scenes cut to make the film more pg13 rating watch it in its uncut version to see one of the funniest and most enjoyable sportsmartial artscomedy of the 2000s,comedy
this is a ride more than a movie and well if it is a movie it could be many more movies also it has a story about a tournament like in a sports movie it has a story about love a really good one like in a romantic movie and it has a story about friendship like in many kinds of movies it surely has some other stories which i wont tell here stephen chow took the amazing work of creating a story involving real characters in not so real but agreeable situations he has given each character a personality of its own just to create comedy with a humor that is sometimes honest and others rough it has some great comedy moments although coming from the characters very peculiar onesit basically all comes from the characters you have different persons united by one thing shaolin and then you have one man with one passion this premise helps to create human emotions in the characters they all have a past that for some reason want to forget except one of them who could be living in the past and still thinks in the goodness of shaolin he believes in it so much that he gives speeches to people about the qualities of his culture and the improvement it could do in society he is right and sooner or later she will remind these things to some people and they will all remember they will all be prepared to get together againwhat a goodhearted film this is and how it is filmed its beyond imagination you will find special effects from other world in occasions these will seem slow for you and you will think they are not well managed or handled but then you will watch watching will make you connect all the elements of the story to make it one in elements i include special effects and say again they couldnt be done better especially in a movie like this onethe actors do a great job the entire cast they give their characters the personal development they need they are not playing the most complex people in the world but they still know what characters theyre playingyou will probably find something youve seen before i cant deny that you will find the ending you expect the situations you imagine the resolutions you anticipate or not youll have the old coach the person with the dreams and the heart the girl its just that youll have them differently youll realize what i meanthe truth is that in a world full of clichs this is another type of clich a very different one so different that i would say it is not a clich at all,comedy
ill keep this sweet and simple apart from pulp fiction this is the coolest film youll ever see the first time i watched it i dribbled like homer simpson over a duff beer i may have passed out a few times as wellmake no mistake this film will be the benchmark for so many spin offs that you simply wont be able to count them due to the delay by miramax to bring this film out combined with the sheer demand for it they have inadvertently made it into a cult classici dont really want to say too much about the sub plots within the film because quite frankly i dont care this is a movie with the added bonus of football thrown in and nothing more there should be no philosophical debate regarding the context its a feel good movie with fantastic sfx made for a global audiencei cried when i had to hand the film back to blockbusters so the second i got home i went straight on the net and ordered me a copyim sure youll all do the same,comedy
ive seen some other movies by stephen chow and i like his style of parody shalin takes it to another level because in this movie you also have respectable special effectsstephens goal is to incorporate his shaolin skills into the game of hong kong movies have always overestimated the effectiveness of chinese and in this movie stephen takes it to the next level he creates a superteam of shaolin monks and they kick ass and it all makes up for fantastic entertainmentyes i know it sounds weird and it is weird but its extremely funnya must see for all fans of japanesehong kong movies and manga a must see for everybody if you ask me,comedy
stephen chow plays mighty steel leg sing a garbage man and shaolin follower who is looking for a way to bring shaolin martial arts to the main stream then one day he meets a down and out couch who after seeing sings incredible skills convinces him to start a teamtogether they gather sings former shaolin brothers to put their latent skills to use on the pitch even though non of them have ever played the game before then the team set out to help fung achieve his life long dream to win the coveted china super cup from team evili absolutely loved this movie i thought it was a brilliantly writtenwell directed piece of actioncomedythis stands as the first movie i have ever seen starring the brilliantly dead pan stephen chow  was put off from seeing his previous movies because the humour was very local to his native hong kong but viewing this movie its interesting to see that a lot of the humour has not lost its touch through the translation i feel chow is starting to in someways play to his overseas fans who may not speak cantonese because i found myself to my relief that i was laughing at a lot of the jokes some physical others verbalthe acting in this was brilliant though the part played by vicky zhao could have been a little better she served as chows love interest in the movie but she never got to do a whole lot except look sad in most of the scenes she was inbut the rest of the cast was great from kwok kuen chan as the goal keeper who has a frightening resemblance to the late great bruce lee to man tat ng as the hapless fung its also worth mentioning that patrick tsefather of hong kong superstar nicholas tse does a great job as the chillingly cool villain of the movienow lets talk about the action its basically wire mixed with cgi which in some ways im not a huge fan of but in this particular film it works because this story feels a lot like a comic book even though that really wasnt chows original intention for the film i thought the scenes where excellently put together and it never dampened my enjoyment of the movieoverall this is an extremely fun enjoyable movie which delivers in all aspects dont go and view this movie expecting a grounded realistic martial art extravaganza as youll be sorely disappointed but if you have seen movies such as the storm riders the duel and volcano high this is the movie for you,comedy
i watched this movie expecting it to be a cute little movie which is what it looked like from the trailer but it was absolutely brilliant some of the scenes such as the first time we see mui making bread are absolute genius so funny that you are screaming with laughterthe idea itself is very ingenious using the style of extravagant martial arts films in a movie and is done beautifully its all very funny in an incredibly silly way while the film is mainly inventive sight gags it also does a good job sketching out its characters in quieter moments its a fairly standard sports movie story and if it were a drama i would complain it was clichd but it uses those sports movie clichs very effectivelyi felt mui seemed like she should have been in more of the film and ive read that a lot of her part got cut out of the american release which is a shame a number of people are saying the original is vastly superior to the edited us version but this version is so great that i would be mightily impressed if that were true,comedy
wow that was all i could say after i saw it stephen chow is truly a splendid director and an awesome actor as well not to mention of course that his martial arts style is unique and special when the movie started i didnt know what to think i had heard it was a comedy but the beginning doesnt suggest it at all however after the dramatic opening comes the real beginning the start of the adventure the story is well designed believable and convincing and the characters will prove to be very complex i loved the way comedy combined with drama and action but what truly amazed me were the stunts and the martial arts the special effects make the already impressive and beautiful art of look even more aweinducing and fantastic the ending was good and sweet but also extremely artistic overall i would say this is a fantastic movie and i recommend it to both sports and lovers alike this movie will make you happy sad at some parts but it will also make you understand at the end i am sure you will bear a big smile,comedy
i had never heard of this movie at all before i walked into suncoast that fateful day that it was playing on the tv in there this movie was so great that i actually stayed and watched the whole thing and then bought the movie since i have watched this movie at least ten times and would gladly watch it again right now stephen chow is a comedic genius pure and simple this movie may not be suited for people that enjoy reality but for people that enjoy off the wall story lines hilarious physical comedy quick jokes that almost pass you by and incredible special effects this movie is awesome watch it make your friends watch it make your dog watch it make your friends dog watch it everybody should see this movie,comedy
i liked this movie even thought im not chinese but im korean this movie was really good its 1010 rating because its so cool everyone should see it because ive seen it so much i know chinese a bit,comedy
this movie is just so fun to watch some parts of it are a bit strange to my american eyes but thats fine with me the story follows a perfect arc and the action scenes just get better and better as the movie goes on the final scene makes a perfect ending for the moviecurrently the miramax dvd of this movie is available really inexpensively this dvd has both the american cut and the original chinese cut and i have watched both the american version chops out a lot of background plot material and a few slower scenes and also some of the jokes that look odd to an american it also adds in some material that was cut from the chinese version overall i didnt mind the american version too much but then my favorite scene came up and i discovered they had axed the original excellent music in favor of a bad cover of fighting this is a heinous crime if you are interested in just how much music can affect the mood of a scene first watch the chinese version and then watch the final scene in the american versioni also really love the music and i plan to buy the soundtrack its only available as in import from japani rate this movie 10 out of 10 i have watched it several times in quick succession and im still not tired of it if you like fun action movies with comedy definitely give this a chancemild spoilers followi really enjoy the scenes where mui uses her tai chi where the men of the movie use linear forceonforce style martial arts mui uses a circular stylethere is a sort of dance number that was cut from the chinese version but is present in the american version if you want to see it watch the american version it comes when the main character meets mui for the first time there are no deleted scenes or any other special features in the miramax dvd so thats the only way to see the scene,comedy
i think my summary says it all really but i have to say more for a review and there are so many great things i could say about this film this film has everything the zero to hero story the humour some amazing although mostly wirefu but still greatand of course me being english the football too i really dont think i have ever seen a better foreign film for all round entertainment value even if you dont like or football theres still the humour and the romantic angle i believe that everyone will find something of interest to them in this film either that or you should give up on watching films right now the only thing i was wondering about this film is why it is called a good name but superman would have been more appropriate its just mental in placesgreat film,comedy
this is easily one of the finest films ever made  i have never had so much fun in a theatre  stephen chow is a damn genius and is a masterpiece  this movie combines raucous humor martial arts sports and great effects in a melange of buttkicking splendor  there are some jokes that i would imagine take a better knowledge of chinese culture pop or otherwise to get but even without this knowledge is utterly brilliant  pay no attention to the negative reviews of this movie theyre written by the criminally insane and should not be trustedtill next time barricade shield,comedy
is a wonderful movie that full of emotion and comedy stephen chow did a very good job as a 1st directed film and perfomed good as well the other players also wonderful is a perfectly combination between and get to see this one and youll like it even for anyone who doesnt like steven this movie is one stephens best movies i loved this cute and funny guy since he was doing drama role in his first few movies i hope to see 2 and also looking forward to see his new movie keep doing a good job steven ill support forever,comedy
i am learning cantonese because most of my friends know it and speak it on occasion i just wanted to understand them because i was learning this language one of my friends bought me this cd as a christmas gift i was struck with utter awe at what chinese movies can do i think the only reason that its not in the top 250 movies of all time section on this web site is because its not an american film its my favorite movie of all time it struck me with the beauty of and both of which i have always liked to some degree and i am now becoming more and more fit as i play day after day outside with my ball who knows maybe some day ill be a big star i have also been wondering about learning alongside all of this its really a completely inspiring piece of work 10 out of 10 this belongs in the number one spot and should be noticed by north america in its original version not the american version that might not be very good alright maybe i took it a little too seriously it is just a comedy but nonetheless a great comedy with great acting and great messages,comedy
i did not expect much of this movie to begin with but it was the high rating that convinced me to see it and i had a very pleasant surprise despite having probably seen the 90 min version it was not dubbed which was all for the better i would say its quite entertaining and i had some good laughs i really liked the special effects and the cookie making scene is my favorite besides despite the fact that i cannot say that the type of humor in this movie would have generally been to my liking as i watched it i was absorbed and forgot about everything else so sometimes a movie that does not pretend to be more than it is turns out to be a nice surprise i would heartily recommend it to anyone for an evening of relaxation and fun,comedy
way to deliver the good mr chow he is the next bruce lee move over bruce lee steve chow is in town the goods are all delivered in this movie by the directoractor of gong fu this movie was so good and delivered more goods than the un the soccar scenes were amazingly real and the special effects were simply astonishing i hope that mr chow makes more movies the best part was when the lady who made the bread becomes the golie and does that amazing move the soccar team team evil was good also that golie was amazing and when the forward kicked the one good guy when he was down was so mean i was shocked that there was no death in this movie i have noticed that there is little death in these movies great cameo by wesley snipes,comedy
is about how a man who bands his classmates together in order to play with its completely original with the idea of and combined togetherand as we all know original and unique stories turn into great movies what makes this movie funny is how when something starts to get dramatic a funny scene or joke just pops right in unexpectedly and brings a laugh to the watchers face i love this movie because of its characters they are completely funny and most of them are simpleminded which makes it easy to follow along their personalities a lot of them are countrylike and their egos makes my stomach hurt from laughing there is a real plot to it a real reason why they are playing and though it may seem that everything is sunshine and rainbows there is actually sinister in it the plot and everything are very easy to follow and sing and his brothers harshness make a great companion to their personalities they all have individual specialties and its a great family film except for a buttcheek flash of course since its originally a hong kong movie the mouthing are a bit disappointing but its hilarious nothingless i hope you all will watch and enjoy this great movie,comedy
i love this movie and stephen chow is at his best what a great actor and good looking toothis is funny original heartwarming and just plain great entertainment i havent laughed so hard in years an intelligent script great acting and tender love story too it had all the right ingredients for a great film i wish there was sequel to this film because it will be a smash i cant believe this movie has not won more awards and its hardly known in north america every character is endearing and just plain funny to watch there are subtexts within subtexts and even a couple of popular culture references that make it so worldly a couple of really sad moments bring the hilarity down to earth but overall one cant help falling in love with all of the characters,comedy
i saw the movie and it was pure joy i like it better than hustle which was also brilliant but somehow i felt exhausted during the footchase between chows character and the landlady is better paced and i like the story better tooi think the effects here are better than in the matrix i know effects from the hollywood movies are nearly flawless and photorealistic compared to movies done by american indies asian movies and european movies but photorealism isnt a priority with me armed with an arsenal of effects how imaginatively can they use it hollywood movies have the best technology and they have scale but the effects arent that creatively used too much of a tendency to show rather than suggest and scale is not the best indicator of a good imaginationbest of all i love the point of view these are a bunch of charming nuts out to make the world a better place by teaching them shaolin they want to popularize it by using it in its a very simple idea but i just love it it reminds me of a bunch of hari krishnas handing out flowers to people or the beatles running around in help or a warner brothers cartoon with a philosophical viewpoint,comedy
okay ill admit it  this movie was worth a chuckle or two and since it wasnt made to be a serious flick i can see how a lot of people enjoyed it  ive seen more than my fair share of movies like this and it pretty much delivered what i was expecting it to  its not packed full of high paced daredevil action and the story is as dopey as expectedif you want to watch this movie to kill some time and be lightly amused by all means do so  dont expect this movie to have a ground breaking story or stellar fight sequences  its not that kind of movie and it wasnt intended to be,comedy

i thought this movie was great i laughed my ass off great special effects slapstick gags it is just plain fun and my kids enjoyed it basic predictable story line but with all the effects and gags this was a thoroughly enjoyable movie to watch theres the five former monks all overweight and out of shape regaining their shaolin powers led by the one inshape former monk who thinks the entire world will benefit from the powers of watch for the flaming ball burn the shirt off the goalie and the gymnastics floor routine with three players all breakdancing and moving the ball and the monk who can grab the ball with his stomach its just great this foreign film is a wonderful respite from such hollywood stinkers like phonebooth and paycheck,comedy
before i get into the review for this gem i want to ask a question why do major american film studies feel they must take a foreign film and muck it up to release it for american audiences now here is a clue for you soulless suits it is a safe bet that if a person is going to see a movie that is subtitled they will be sophisticated enough to get the movie without you trying to dumb it down to american audiences some of the changes made by miramax for the us theatrical release of this film are just plain nonsensical all right so we have subtitles for the people speaking but miramax decides to use cgi to replace chinese text on signs and other props why in the original film the english translation of these signs and props was included in the subtitles then there is the cutting edited for content and length as the television networks always say this film was cut by a 400 pound drunken wrestler with a machete some of the funniest parts are gone in the us release music has been replaced grrrr i could go on and on so let me just cut to the chase if you get the dvd you have a choice of watching the us theatrical release or the original chinese release do yourself a favor and say a pox on you theatrical release and go directly to the chinese theatrical release you will be glad you didsteven chow stars in and directs this gem he plays sing brother 5 one of five brothers who are masters but who are forced to make their living at other occupations mostly ignominiously sing is constantly trying to think of a way to promote and make it more popular with the masses when a washed out star approaches him about using his talents to play sing realizes that he has found out how to promote together with his other brothers he uses his skills to play and the team enters into a tournamentwith perhaps a subtle dig at american culture their primary rival is team evil a team of american drug enhanced dirty dealers the bad news bears plot has been done before but that really does not matter because chow packs this film with such style humor wit and action that you cannot help but laugh and smile with satisfaction throughout the film this film is at the same time a parody and a tribute to films the enjoyment i felt was the kind of enjoyment i should have felt but did not with tarantinos soulless kill bill seriesthis was definitely a couple of the most enjoyable hours i have spent in some time  deanna  www2hourscom,comedy
ive seen several of stephen chows other moviesbut i swear his movies get better  more creative every timei mean who else would make or star in a movie called i liked everything about this moviebut i dont like it when studios take great movies like this  translates itcuts out original music  scenesbecause watching this movie in my native language hmong really enhanced the entertainmentbut overall this movie has dazzling special effects with matrix style actiongood character developmentgreat playingcombined with superb break dancing  martial artsif you were ever underestimated  you prove them wrongthen is definitely for you,comedy
this movie was very good and hilarious this had me and my family on the floor laughing throughout the whole film i highly recommend this to not only movie fans but movie fans in general i feel that this is a great movie and good for the whole family i would give it a rating of  a movie,comedy
this movie was and instant top 5 on my list of all time greatest films it has a great story superb cast the jokes get better everytime you watch it and it has one of the best endings a true battle i have seen in a film i cannot give this film enough praise one note miramax has picked up if you can watch the original subtitled one it should be superior in every way since miramax never does hk films justice,comedy
to use as a vehicle to spread to the massesperhaps only mr stephen chow sing chi could come up with thatit was no surprise that this movie became a huge sensation all across asiacould have been the worldthanks to miramaxlike all other singyehs filmsthis movie really hurt my stomach from the laughterbut it was not only the humor that made me love it so muchin factit was the way he executes the movie that makes it a masterpiecenever before have i ever seen a hk movie so well balanced between action and comedyand after watching hustlehis next moviei was afraid that even he himself could no longer reach the high standard achieved by this filmwasnt just a great movieit developed my love for kung fuseriouslyoverallyou are bound to love this filmwhether youre a fan or not psive watched it 12 times alreadyas of now,comedy
some people myself included dislike asian cinema because some films tend to exaggerate certain aspects related to martial arts like people flying and defying laws of gravity this of course is product of cultural differences as we tend to criticize what we dont identify withstill i truly enjoyed this film as it didnt take itself seriously there were plenty of martial arts and gravity defying movements but they were all intended to look funny the football matches where great as each member of the shaolin team showed their uncanny techniquesthere were some good jokes a goalie who looked and acted like bruce lee that was a nice way to remember himthe villains of the movie were baldly called team evil it was great how sing explained his future coach how learning would have helped the girl who slipped on a banana peel to name a fewi would dare to say that i found better than most of recent american comedies and you dont need to be an asian cinema fan to enjoy it,comedy
i really enjoyed this movie contains some spoilers the graphics were very good for a 2001 movie in my opinion stephen chow is a plays a great role in this movie not to mention hes also the director of it the use of is very creative in this project and took my legs onto a shaky ride i laughed so much in the movie its one of my top favorites the use of fireballs is very interesting but got a little annoying in some ways if you saw it in american theaters and thought it sucked well i suggest you look for the dvd and put it in subtitles because you get almost 20 minutes cut off of the original time length and some things have been censored in the american version which is a sheer disappointment because it cut off some laughter in the movie,comedy
you can term it as a battle between the good and the evil its all about how sing stephen chow convinces rest of his 5 disgraced brothers to use shaolin as a medium to play and ultimately win the championship against the evil team headed by the notorious hung yin tse and in this venture he is helped by golden leg fung man tat ng who plays the role of the coach and mui vicki zhao who loves and helps sing during his difficult times       the first half of the film seems a bit boring sing preaching his brothers to make acceptable and interesting for others though some scenes make you laugh but you really like the film due to its much funny latter halfthe match scenes to be specific and adding to the humour is some good dose of emotional scenes though sometimes they feel like becoming overdose chow zhao and tse are good the main ingredient of the film is its special effects and that aspect has been handled well but you feel that all this could have been much better and done in a more professional way the match scenes act as the main attraction for the film they make you laugh and you cant help thinking about the amount of innovativeness that has been used to execute those scenes overall the film is good and funny its suggested that you watch the movie with blank minds lay back and just relax        i would give it a 7 off 10,comedy
well i saw yesterday with a few friends and we all agreed on one thing  it sure was uneven i mean in some scenes the film is innovative and very very funny then again other scenes are so bad and so poorly acted youre kind of forced to laugh at the film rather than with itall the football scenes were great and the effects were very funny if not particularily realistic they were hilarious in a typical jackie chanslapstick kind of wayas for all the humour involving dialogue  well it was just very bad and sometimes embarrasing and the subtitling on the dvd i bought from hong kong featured some of the most outrageous engrish ive ever seen for example a bald person was twice referred to as being blad an explosion was translated to an exploration and a limp person was called a lame person very funny indeed though not intentionally sothis film is so uneven im tempted to give it two ratings one for the wonderful special effects and football scenes and another for the atrocious scenes of drama and dialogue its that unevenin the end i feel that film was certainly watchable if only for the football scenes alone510,comedy
hands down the best hong kong movie ive seen in a long long long timestephen chow has solidified himself as a multimillionhkdollar actordirector with this movie i enjoyed many of his earlier hits tricky master king of comedy god of cookery and hail the judge but simply takes the cakechow really milked his chick wagon on this movie with cameo appearances from karen mok god of cookery and cecilia cheung king of comedy the only thing i didnt like about the movie was the way vicky zhao weis character mui was portrayed shes definitely one of the hottest women in the planet and they portrayed her to be an ugly bakerbut all is forgiven its all for the sake of insane comedy a must see movie a must addition to any collectors shelf,comedy
sports movies have come somewhat of a long way but many of them are not particularly memorable outside of cult status for being too cliched predictable and lacking in much story or character development however what happens when you subvert the sports movie genre by adding in martial arts and special effects you end up getting by stephen chow a beloved sports comedy from china that has been acclaimed by people all across the world for just how ridiculous albeit creative it truly is and i couldnt agree morethe storyline centers around a former shaolin monk named mighty steel leg sing who reunites his five brothers so they can all apply their superhuman martial arts skills to play football everywhere else and bring shaolin to the masses all with the help of the crippled coach golden leg fung in order to compete with his biggest foe hung from a conceptual standpoint this story does sound pretty straight forward but in execution it is so much fun to watch all thanks to the martial arts each of the six brothers display their own distinct fighting skills that depict a lot of intricate movement and suspenseful tension making their games both in practice and in tournament breathtaking to watch in fact once they enter the final tournament whenever a certain player on fungs team loses or just struggles it becomes devastating to witness and we really feel for each playerspeaking of the characters its funny to see how each brother ends up prior to them deciding to join in on the game sing is the one with the toughest karate legs but he has to control his strength when playing the game and realize that theres more to the game than just kicking the ball around the other brothers like iron head hooking leg iron shirt lightning hand and light weight vest go from being washed up losers in crumby jobs to soon displaying their own distinct abilities such as head butting blunt force jumping high and ground tumbling in addition despite them all being washed up their energy and charisma with one another provide a lot of genuine humor to the film making them hysterical but also endearing in addition fung is a much more earnest coach than hung since hung uses a certain medicine for his team evil as opposed to fung who mixes realistic magic into the game of lastly the baker mui at first seems like the typical love interest for sing in spite of her skills at tai chi but sings feelings towards her actually play a bigger role in the film and their moments together provide the most heart in the film making both of them equally sympatheticnow in terms of the technical aspects stephen chow himself stated that the films over the top cg and kinetic moves were inspired by the anime captain tsubasa and it really shows on screen while cgi was still only just starting to improve back then the effects in the film are so creative and highly imaginative that its hard not to be amazed by how much time and effort was put into them whenever the film utilizes slapstick for comedy the effect really pays off and the movie practically becomes an imitative cartoon not to mention the moves themselves are very well choreographed and energized showing off a lot of impressive stunts that keep the viewer on the edge of their seats without them becoming overbearing none of the fighting moves are the same so theres much variety in the action department that will please both fans of kung fun movies and martial arts aficionados themselves never have i seen a sports movie of this caliber before and now that i have i love every single minute of it may seem like an odd movie at first glance but thats exactly what it needs to be as it elevates the sports movie cliches by mixing in magnificent moves lovable characters wacky slapstick humor and bizarre yet fantastic special effects whether youre a fan of sports movies movies or even both please give this film a watch and i guarantee that you will come out of it with a lot of excitement and energy they say mixing two different genres can sometimes backfire but movies like this prove that taking a risk with two different genres can pay off tremendously as long as you know how to make the proper execution,comedy
i dont know what to write  what a movie  i want to share a thing that my grand father who hates comedy also laughed while watching the movie  stephen chow is the best comedy movie makers of the world  it made me his fan  the whole plot is absolutely superb  my suggestion is if you are depressed or sitting idly with a bad mood you must watch it,comedy
a shaolin martial artist applies to setting up a team of old friends under the tutelage of a crippled coach who is seeking revenge on the man who ruined his career as a playeri love the idea of combining extraordinary martial arts skills with football but nothing illustrates my failure to understand asian humour more than this zany comedy from stephen chow while many clearly find absolutely hilarious the film made me laugh about as much as the time my appendix almost rupturedin addition to the dreadful slapstick and silly impromptu dance routines that pass for humour in this perplexingly popular comedy sports film i also found myself cringing at the horribly dated and totally unconvincing cgi that it relies so heavily upon you would think they could at least make the football look real,comedy
59 a very crazy very childish  but in a good way  effects based comedy the ideas featured dont always work well like most comedy although largely they do and even the few more subtle comedic elements translate nicely theres quite a number of strange and very eastern almost manga style elements that would never make it into a western film such as the really unusual romantic love interest character that comes across as more confusing than anything else in terms of the actual played its more likened to an episode of wacky races than the real game itself but its still very fun to watch and fans of chow will almost certainly like his overthetop brand of comedy,comedy
wow the title of my review kinda bites but enough of that ill keep it simple by saying that if you havent seen this you need to make it a point to stephen chow has made a hilarious film that somehow manages to combine comedy and song and dance numbers together in a crazy mash up of a film ive read comments on this film where people complain about the absurdity of it all but theyre missing the point this movie is absolutely absurd and if you cant just watch it and enjoy it then you are also missing the point i mean i could go down the list of really silly jokes in this film but to do so would simply ruin the experience of watching it for the first timethe only negative thing i have to say is that some of the special effects are kind of lousy at times and the humor gets really weird in that chinese way as im sure the humor of american film is strange to the chinese on occasion especially when watching the longer uncut version of the film still this film is loaded with laughs and great scenes theres this one scene in particular where stephen chows character and one of his brothers attempt to mix and song at a local bar that kills me every time i watch itstephen chow is an incredible talent and my only real regret with this film is that i didnt see it in the theaters if youve seen hustle and liked it chances are youll like this as wellrating  out of ,comedy
the context of this film is the age old one of a team of no hopers taking on the evil champions of one sport or another in this case its a bunch of students who have moved onto rather less glamorous situations with the help of an old but once great champion football player they enter the biggest football tournament in towninitially i was a little concerned i am a big fan of martial arts films but have an equal dislike of footballwhen i put the film on i was half expecting to be turning it off again shortly how wrong could i have beenwhilst there is a football thread trough out the film the movie is 100 a comedy and an extremely good one as good and maybe better than hustle in its own waythe is totally overboard in the best of ways hustle style again its a joy to watch and alone it will have you grinning from ear to ear the sfx are quality a treat to the eye add to this the comedy and make no mistake this film is full to the brim with comedy the jokes are think and fast both visual and verbal some are very simple and others a little more deep there were one or two jokes that took a few seconds to register but when they did it was a whoop of laughtera very decent watch and will have you laughing out loud even on your ownif you liked hustle then this is definitely a film worth seeing,comedy

features the comedy of stephen chow in top form chow stars as sung a young master who teams up with golden leg a former star to create a team together the ragtag martial artists become a formidable force on the playing field using the most amazing moves the moves employed here would put jackie chan to shame the story uses some melodramatic elements such as the love interest between sung and mui and the buildup to the climactic match between the masters and team evil coached by golden legs nemesis chow puts in a great performance and the visuals are eyepopping to watch will make you see films in a whole new light,comedy
chows irreverent knack of physical comedy enhanced by computer gimmickry is exploited to the hilt when a sextet of struggling shaolin disciples decide to form a martially superhuman football team to spread the good word of to the masses chow never a great purveyor of subtlety the bad guys are called team evil plays their captain and he can kick a ball so hard it bends the goalposts one player iron head can balance vertically on a football with his eyes closed the ground shakes the goal nets perish and players are hurtled through space its a real feast for the eyes even if it has very little to do with either shaolin or thats probably for the best as the massappealing qualities of this exuberant product have assured the films success far beyond the boundaries of chows other more native comedic efforts those uninitiated into the madcap world of stephen chow could do no better than to start here youll find it a wondrous treat like no other note hunt down the uncut chinese release if you can miramaxs turgid dubbed version is vastly inadequate,comedy
what a great film following in the foot steps of slap shot baseketball and more recently dodgeball a truly funny and moving sports comedy with the under dogs the villain with his evil team some love some laughsand a whole lot of fun what a genius idea to combine and the is superb as is the wet wire and special effectscombined with some classic slapstick this is a great film youll wow youll laugh you might even cry if anything could spark an interest in in the us it would be this shame it never got a cinematic release  if you want to see a truly entertaining foreign film see this one,comedy
this is a brilliantly funny film that sends up in a most glorious way the ridiculous genre of where people are suspended in mid air for hours well ages and cg effects are well over the top the plot is brilliant although its comparatively slow early pace might test those expecting a wall to wall action packed film the greatest problem is that to pander to western audiences the film has been dubbed and very poor it is too we are not attributed with the intelligence to read subtitles instead very poor voice acting has been used to dub the film which was really distracting i only hope that when it comes on dvd it will have english subtitles and the missing 30 minutes cut to make it more acceptable to western audiences but well worth seeing,comedy
what do you get when you cross crouching tiger magnificent seven matrix bend it like beckham and classic michael jackson music videos a hilarious martialartsmovie with scenes that last in the mind long after the movie has ended the premise of applying shaolin teachings to everyday tasks would not work beyond the idea if not for the welldefined characterizations that stay true for the entire movie the pace and mix of dialogue and action slapstick and slomo martialarts good and evil was just right to keep me laughing without the awkward pauses i have come to expect from comedy parodies more than once i thought the movie had shown all its cards well before the end but i was wrong it manages to continue building action and drama to the predictable but nonetheless climactic end,comedy
i have seen the original cut of this brilliant movie and was very disappointed to find miramax had cut it down to size to pander to western audiences but moans aside this is still one of the best movies i have ever seen it has it all romance comedy breathtaking action and some superb special effects that make this a must see why doesnt hollywood make movies as good as this obviously asian movie makers know their audiences are smart and give them movies to suit with more emphasis on character and plot development as well as new and inventive action sequences and modest yet believable special effects but i digressif yr looking for that eagle amongst the chickens this is it full credit to stephen chow and his crew lets see more of it1010 although i base this score on the original cut,comedy
take this idea masters in the movies can do many amazing things so why not use that skill for other things like not tripping when walking parking your car or playing this is great little comedy where the cgi and wire work are used fantastically to add to story and for lots of jokesthis hong kong movie is set in mainland china and contains a lot of ideas that hong kong people have about main chinese people such as they are over enthusiastic greed  corrupt  have bad complexions and have lost their traditional chinese values i live in china so i get their jokes which are both true and done in a affectionate mannerthe story is this a group of brothers who are all losers in their life but who all learnt shoalin team up to play in a competition first they have to rediscover their and then finally beat the evil team with a little help from tai chi steamed bun chefa very enjoyable movie with a lot of visual jokes,comedy
is one of those movies thats good to watch only once it spoofs the whole genre with excellent jokes and scenes its quirky enough to be thoroughly enjoyable so just kick back and have some funthe storyline had plenty of wholes and unmotivated transitions but the first time you see the movie you can be forgiving because of all the laughs im guessing that on subsequent viewings the movie wouldnt be quite as funny and would probably even be boring there was not that much and way too many computereffects especially towards the end but the jokes were really really funny so just for that i think the movie is worth seeing710,comedy
they did it againafter castle in the sky and other cool moviesthis is the masterpiece we were waiting forwho havent seen this movies betta gothe people who dont watch anime should watch one this is what it is all about,comedy
i havent seen a movie that i could watch again right when it ends this was one  it was so funny  it was very outrageous very slapstick and to top it off very chinese  unfortunately it sad to think that most will never get a chance to see this movielot of fun bravo,comedy
ive been dying to see this film for the past 2 years as a fan of hk cinema i read in horror about how miramax planned to butcher the film  due to the continuing us theatrical release dates being pushed back i feared the film would suffer the same fate as yimou zhangs brilliant heroying xiong for this reason i was joyous when i scored an all region dvd of the filmonly to be seriously dissappointed it just came across like a silly police academy type comedy the fight scenes were below average  made the scenes in black mask 2 look good by comparison the characters behaved so randomly that there were really no characters since there was nobody to really care about  since all of the fights were done via cgi effects i ended up so bored that i ejected the dvd  just watched the newsi think a lot of my dislike of the film has more to do with the fact that comedies dont often translate well i am sure that there were things in the film that were referring to things in chinese society that someone in north america just cannot understand plus the english subtitles on the dvd i saw were pretty badthey were exact translations but i have seen a lot of hk films  enjoy most of them tsui hark  corey yuen are my faves  quite frankly just didnt do it for me,comedy
this is one of my favorite movies of all time it has excellent comedy action special effects and heartwarning do not watch the us hacked up version the original version with subtitles is by far the best way to watch it in the us version they literally cut out some of the jokes changed music around not for the better and took out some of the things that make this movie speciali definitely recommend this movie to anyoneps for some reason my wife doesnt like it i think this movies greatness might only be appreciated by guys but i could be wrong,comedy
wowdid i really love this film so far on imdb i have reviewed well over 1000 films and i must say that this is about the most original refreshingly different and funny film i have seen in years without a doubt it is the best chinese film i have seen and may be even better than my favorite japanese comedy happiness of katakuris it is onpar with the funniest american and british films as well how it has a ratings in the mid7s on imdb i really dont know except that perhaps there are a lot of stick in the muds who have absolutely no sense of humor you must see this filmthis movie succeeds because it is a perfect melding of a traditional sports movie its highly reminiscent of the american film dodge ball with way overthetop crouching tigertype martial arts special effectswith a little bruce lee thrown in as well the one goalie even looks like lee and from start to finish it is just plain funnyeven the opening credits are greatthe film is about an explayer who was knocked out of the sport when he missed a penalty kick and was savagely beaten by the crowd the the film advances 20 years to the present where this same man is still downandout and wanting revenge against his old bossthe owner of team evil well he meets a very strange poor guy dedicated to shaolin and realizes this guys amazing and superhuman powers can he used for once he convinces the guy to join a new team this master summons his older overweight and completely unathletic appearing brothers to form the basis for a team these apparent losers though turn out to be highly reminiscent of the 5 chinese brothers from the old childrens storywith superhuman skills of their own one brother can kick a ball so high it takes an hour to hit the ground another has a head of steel another can carry the ball on his chest and another is a goalie who is apparently invincible and can score against the other team all the way from his own goalie box they enter the national tournament and all appears ready for them to take the championship and the 1000000 prizeuntil team evil unveils their newest secret weapon will the good team prevail or will evil win the day tune in to see it and be completely amazed and bowled over by the amazing and funny special effectsplus a lot of great twists and turns along the way this film really has heart and is great fun for anyone except total stickinthemuds who cant laugh and suspend all disbelief for this wonderful fantasy you must see this film nowgo on get up and get the dvdnow psthe dvd has 2 very different versionsthe american version less than 90 minutes long and the original version which is about 20 minutes longer and is subtitled my review is based on the subtitled version i would never consider watching the shorter version as every moment i spent watching this film was pure goldhow could any clod consider cutting perfection down to 89 minutes,comedy
all movies are about other movies but it is something else when the whole point of a movies is to make that explicitif you just come to this superficially youll have fun it bends and borrows from other genres some funny bits are simple and formulaic but they are surrounded by other comic bits that derive from deep introspection and selfawareness im convinced that this is among the most powerful sources of humor and it works herethis isnt the type of reference that say scary movie uses where an external film is used as a sort of amusing costume this is more like a high school girls adoption of prepackaged persona shifting from one to the other investing as much of self as is available its no joke which is the jokei thought was much better at this more natural and a bit less seamless but where this one is superior is in how the camera participates there are many shots in here that start out in a conventional stance eye height focused on an individual and then smoothly swoop up to reveal a context usually there is a revolving shift associated with this so that as the camera lifts it also shifts revolves around some pivot which is not our original focus also often the camera will temporarily settle on a larger feature in a shot related to contextfor instance theres a shot here that starts with a face then lifts and revolves around a group centering in action then moving around the city and finding a relevant billboard then moving on i think there are scores of these here and they very craftily underpin the basic architecture of the thing where the transmovie context shiftsyou can see this in a few scene transitions as well which are also engineered to fit the architecture of shifting contextbeingsill give one example in the future as the web matures i expect well have all sorts of film related lists with clips best kiss and stuff like that heres my suggestion for one of the most cinematically appropriate transitions eversteel leg has previously put his handwritten card in a can and kicked it nearly to outer space at the time we wonder because the card was intended for the hapless golden leg now steel leg is surrounded by a gang who wants to beat him up because of his inane attempt at shaolin lounge singing meanwhile golden leg is at his lowest drunkenly peeing on a wall an adjacent wall has a sign no peeing on the wall which takes golden over he discovers a crushed can embedded in the wall and pulls it out from the can he removes the card and recognizes it at this moment the wall crumbles because of the damage by the canit reveals steel surrounded by the toughs as we last left him so that now we as the audience will watch as golden does we see the fight using a ball from whence the idea for comes the threatening gang joins the teamthis device is an extremely clever solution to several problems how to make the editing serve that architecture of the thing how to fold our designated audience golden leg with us how to logically introduce the notion of how to show that movietomovie walls are coming downteds evaluation  3 of 3 worth watching,comedy
golden leg fung is his teams star player but when he misses a penalty the fans invade the pitch and beat him so badly he is crippled twenty years later he is working as a cleaner for team evil but still dreaming of returning as a coach then the owner tells him he will never be a coach he leaves determined to start his own team shortly afterwards he meets mighty steel leg sing a street cleaner who is also a practitioner of shaolin he is looking for ways to make more popular and suggests using its techniques in football this is initially met with scepticism but somewhat inevitably fung is soon teaching sing and his brothers how to play football initially they are laughed at but soon rivals see that they are virtually unbeatable it is only a matter of time before they face team evil in the final away from the football there is the possibility of romance with mui a girl who uses skills to make steamed bunsif you like your comedy subtle then this wont be for you it is about as subtle as having a bottle broken over your head something that happens repeatedly to one character if however you want lots of laughs of a fairly slapstick nature martial arts mayhem and football as youve never seen it before then this is a lot of fun there is lots action although it is violent at times it is in a comical rather than brutal manner the story doesnt provide many surprises but to be honest i didnt expect any the characters are a lot of fun stephen chow and mantat ng impress as fung and sing vicki zhao is charming as mui and the rest of the cast are solid the cgi may be fairly obvious but that just adds to its charm overall id definitely recommend this to anybody wanting a good laughthese comments are based on watching the longer original language version with english subtitles,comedy
it was hilarious and i love it but its quality wasnt the best,comedy
i have not come across many movies like this even after 19 years since its release it is an ultimate classic still very much relevant a must watch,comedy
a blend of football and comedy classic of film song that induce unstoppable laughmust watch,comedy
i have watched my fair share of stephen chow movies but i will never forget the fun and joy that comes with the oddness and craziness of fun dumb and easily rewatchable its hard not to enjoy yourselffollowing a down on his luck exstar who was paid off to lose a major match and then betrayed by the man who paid him this man was golden leg he even had it tattooed on his stomach now as a lost and broken man golden leg finds a new lot in life after meeting a homeless master of whose specialty is the steel leg technique steel leg has been trying to find a way to bring the masses in some appealing way after a few failed attempts at other ventures steel leg and his other down on their luck masters try their luck at coached by golden legive written leg a lot today now can the team dethrone the evil that is team evil and win and glorywhat you need to know about this movie is that it has a goofy style to it like a lot if not all of stephen chows work but there is also a sincerity to it that you cant help but support also while the overarching plot is not new to the sports genre or the martial arts genre either this movie still seems like a breath of fresh air for both of them playing off the regular cliches and using them as joke points just to add to the exaggeration when they finally get into the tournament itself the physical sports comedy just escalates until finally against the unstoppable team evil the movie plays out like an episode of dragon ball zwell maybe multiple episodes of dbz tai chi and are used to create whirlwinds fire dragons and spectacular feats of crazy in a weird and fun wacky finaleif you cant tell i do like this film a lot i also do think that it may not be for everyone if you are a bit more serious about your martial arts and sports films then you may not like this one as much but still it comes highly recommended by me,comedy
like i said in the title silly selfaware not but extremely hilarious it is not for pure bruce lee fans or jackie chan fans you should not take the movie seriously it is important to have a sense of humor if you do not like it it is ok you are not a bad person like others claim you must be but i guess it is not your cup of tea in the start you might get the urge to stop watching but resist that urge and watch till the end it is a laughing riot,comedy
years removed from his heyday a disgraced former star recruits a squad of mystically powerful masters to bend the rules and dominate the game in his stead or perhaps its the masters who have recruited him to lend their dispirited old crew a unified sense of direction either way the fruits of their partnership are awfully juicystarring stephen chow whose zany effectsreliant fighting style would later make hustle such an unexpected delight its a film that insists you flip the switch on your brain for a while and just enjoy the inanity of the moment the action scenes make no effort to hide the wires or mask the cg which looks silly but also erases any concern about anchoring them to reality freed from those constraints the skys the limit for this creative production it takes every opportunity to oneup previous shots with a flair for the eccentric culminating in a recklessly destructive cartoonviolent final match against an equally powerful outfit of genetically engineered starswhenever it tries to go straight and actually focus on storytelling is a total disaster every stereotype about a hurried inept overseas production rolled into one fortunately we dont wait long between slices of the real sizzle  those absurdly silly effect shots  and the films wacky genuine sense of humor helps to balance out the rest stupid stupid fun,comedy
i watch this movie 13 times every day i can say with 100 certainty that this is the best movie ever made i talk about this movie constantly and recommend it to everyone i seesnape kills dumbledore,comedy
great movie that put stephen chow on the market mix of movie football and comedy in all three sections she is successful chow who has a pretty good domain without being jet li and combines it perfectly with his excellent skills for humor is removed from the sleeve one of the funniest asian movies ive ever seen and it is not easy to take humor from orientals the serious faces of chow when he is saying a nonsensical comment are great it also plays in its favor the gang of secondary that has been sought and that maintain the level of humor of the film that way you can not get enough of chow that is the best thing for a comedy that not all the scenes of humor fall on the same type well it does not become weary separate mention for how well chow includes the music in the film for both the scenes of the parties and for the comic scenes as for the football scenes  incredible its spectacularity makes captain tsubasa look ridiculous the parties are raised almost as if they were an action movie and special effects its worth watching the movie if only for this a pleasant surprise since one was not expecting much of a thing titled as it is logicalthe best the final match against the evil team the worst your title can scare many peoplethe phrase i did not come to fight  i came to play stephen chow,comedy
while this shares some of the wonderful sense of the surreal and absurd that made chows 2008 hustle a true classic comedy spoof of marshal arts films its nowhere near as consistent or as inventive in its comedy there are some real laughs but also some serious dead spots and tooeasy jokes in this tale of a bunch of once shaolin trained masters giving up their humdrum and largely unsuccessful workaday lives to team up and become the mightiest playing force the world has ever seen or are they team evil is waiting to take them on in the 1 million tournament goodhearted and original enough to be worth seeing once but unlike its even wilder and smarter descendant i cant imagine feeling a need to go back and see it again or to own it if that later film is like a hong kong action monty python film this one is more three stooges,comedy
is a real mixed bag of a film that is both wildly uneven and wildly entertaining starting off on very dodgy unfamiliar ground if you think jackie chans style of comedy is bizarre youve seen nothing i began by wondering what on earth i was watching however once the film gets onto the subject of football about 45 minutes in things start to get really good as the typically inept group of fighters form a team and get ready for one heck of a matchstephen chow throws in plenty of diverse elements to keep the viewers watching from numerous references to films eg the matrix and actors  including a goalie whos the reincarnation of bruce lee the comedy is of the hit and miss variety but there are some genuinely funny moments which tend to be the most bizarre of the film  including the egg joke which has to be seen to be believed the acting is fine if a little over the top but in light of the film as a whole how could it not be and the special effects done using cgi are fantasticthe strength of this film lies in the football matches there are about five spread throughout the film and theyre brilliant if youve ever wanted to see players flying through the air spinning around upside down or lots more crazy things then this is the film to watch make no mistake i hate football i loathe sport in general and find it stultifyingly boring but breathes life into the game the end match is the best part of the film surprisingly violent but with the scene in which the goalkeepers clothes are torn off by the power of the ball you cant help but watch gape and laugh at the sheer insanity of it all unlike anything else youll ever see,comedy
martial arts in cinema often have this tendency to go way overthetop in its depiction and it pretty much ruins the whole picture for me especially if this exaggerated action is present in movies that take their drama seriouslyit is no secret that i prefer films that display martial arts in a highly realistic  grounded fashion in short movies like crouching tiger hidden dragon are a big no for me while im game for action extravaganzas like the raideven in comedies this stylised illustration of martial arts doesnt work all the time since majority of them are busy spoofing instead of weaving a funny tale around it and thats exactly what separates from the normdoes blow its martial arts aspect out of proportion but it retains the very essence of it despite the films batshit crazy premise and absurd slapstick wit the film brims with so much heart  warmth that it remains a joyful experience from start to finishthe story of follows a former shaolin monk who wants to bring to the masses but has been unable to find a way that works however after meeting with an exstar he decides to promote through and gets back in touch with all his brothers to form a superhuman teamcowritten  directed by stephen chow the film is hilarious as hell from beginning to end and qualifies more as a comedy than spoof also thanks to chows skillful writing it packs in a genuinely heartfelt story beneath its utterly ridiculous premise and even its characters are worthy of emotional investment well at least a couple of themvisual effects play a key role in realising its most unbelievable moments on screen and while the cgi looks a bit cartoonish it still adds to the films overall craziness additional momentum is provided by its splendid camerawork swift pacing  thrilling score and the maniacal contribution from its entire cast further strengthens its positionon an overall scale is an absolute bonkers of a movie that promises its viewers an overdose of laughter and effortlessly provides it a rollicking ride that benefits from its kinetic direction ebullient screenplay lively camerawork stimulating score  outlandish performances this sports comedy works because its heart is at the right place,comedy
golden leg fung was a great hong kong star his teammate hung deliberately threw a game and hired a mob to break fungs leg hung is now a fabulously rich and powerful chairman of the tournament while fung is a drunken hasbeen with a limp fung encounters street person mighty steel leg sing stephen chow who thinks shaolin is the answer to everything sing meets specialpowered street baker mui with severe acne sing tries to promote by singing in a karaoke club with brother iron head sing refuses to fight a street gang but turns it into a super demonstration fung tells sing to play and sing sees an opportunity to promote with the other shaolin brothersi love this most for the moments of deadpan humor and its surreal touches there are a couple of aspects that i find less funny the first game with the thugs is great but the subsequent games become less and less funny its a function of the same action over and over again the other minor problem is muis makeover she has emotional flipflops that are too jarring its also a great opportunity for her to join the team i wish the scene starts with the dejected team and an injured goalkeeper by the end they come up with an idea for her to train as the new goalkeeper her training could be a fun traditional addition i love the first half and the second half isnt that bad,comedy
i remember watching this movie when it hit theaters 15 years ago and i remember it as a quite good movie by experience i know that childhood memories of movies tend to be a bit better than reality so naturally i was a bit cautious when i decided to revisit shaolinlast night luckily this is not the case because this movie is still quite good im not really into movies about sports martial arts or love so for me this mixture of and martial arts sided with a somewhat subtle love story and topped off with a pinch of goofy humor creates an refreshingly original and interesting movie about those same subjects im pretty sure i dont always understand the chinese form of humor and most likely some of it is also lost in the subtitles as well but still it makes me smile and it makes me cheer for the good guys in every sense of the words a movie easy to watch and easy to enjoy,comedy
is a very quirky movie i cant say i have seen anything else like it before the movie has a very basic premise an explayer gathers up a rag tag group of players and coaches them to win a tournament against all odds its a premise that has been done to death in many sports movies but this is the first time i have seen it infused with kung futhe adds a lot of fun as cheesy as the special effects are it still makes the movie more enjoyable on the whole i do however think they over did it with the juvenile jokes there were funny parts but many times i just couldnt understand how they thought they were being funny women with facial hair for no reason at allultimately its not a bad movie but its not one i would watch again and again i wouldnt say you must be a fan to enjoy this movie but i think it definitely helped me enjoy it,comedy
if you are a fan of asian cinema watch shoalin if you are looking for a downright funny film watch shoalin if you laughed till you cried watching hustle prepare to do so againdo not however watch shoalin if you are looking for a serious romance or for the you will be somewhat disappointed i say somewhat because among all the slapstick humour and jokes the movie has quite a moving story and the characters are developed quite well at least the main ones are the movie flows really well from the beginning it never becomes dull or tedious and the jokes and gags are timed perfectly courtesy of steven chow who is a fantastic director shame the types of movies he works with arent really appreciated and hollywood has made sure of that besides that go see the movie if you want 2 hours of pure entertainment from a fantastic moviein terms of a comedy movie i give this a 910 but in all seriousness this movie gets a 7510 from me,comedy
next time you are in the mood for a laugh out loud action comedy film thats both clean and wicked funny turn to this wonderful film starts a rag tag group of brothers that have lost their way in shaolin and band together to win a tournament the action and chaos that ensues is hilarious and amusing as long as you go in knowing that its supposed to besounds ridiculous right thats exactly the point the whole plot while it works and is pretty well done is meant to be taken very lightly it is an absolutely goofy absurd and high comedy gag fest that has laughs coming at rapid fire i cant recommend this movie enough truly kicks grass,comedy

seriously one the greatest comedies ever madeand absolutely without even a shred of doubt the greatest comedy every created if you are on the fenceget off of it just watch it already the characters are lovable and quirky the lead character personifies the mantra of never give up the action is waaaaaaaaaay over the top if only actual was 14000th as entertaining as this movie wasisi might actually attend a match once in my life the movie isnt really about though is just a way to utilize the godlike power of gung fu for the purpose of both enriching the individuals and enriching the world at large the entire world can benefit from gung fuand they prove it,comedy
i sincerely apologize for the awful pun in my title but this movie kicks grass was already takenif you dont see this movie youre a kung fuool will make you laugh itll make your blood pump itll make you misty in a few spots and most of all itll just knock you on your butt with its dazzling noholds barred fulltilt inyourface presentation by that i dont necessarily mean action but rather im referring to the movies boldness in daring to go where other movies might not with little or no warning people may strip off their clothes and start singing  dancing in the street with little or no warning scenes may suddenly take you to the front lines storming the beach of normandy and so on in that respect it reminded me a lot of the classics airplane or blazing saddles or other absurdist comedies like thosenote just be sure to see the original chinese theatrical release because the american version edits  shortens a few of the more bizarre scenes i guess its to give us a more digestible story digestible hah this movie is designed to make you puke your cinematic guts out whatever that meansfrom the first few seconds we get a good idea of whats in store for us the opening credits and rousing score are highly reminiscent of sergio leones famous spaghetti western the good the bad  the ugly note again the american version cut the opening titles and changed the music boo and indeed is a lot like a spaghetti western on crackin addition to the films i mentioned above i would compare this to the excellent japanese comedies kamikaze girls and cutie honeyyou dont want to miss this movie so hurry up and hopkido down to your local video store and rent it ouch that one was painful,comedy
combining with what an odd but yet at the same time logical and humorous idea its a combination that works out well for this movie that you of course shouldnt take serious in any wayits a really overthetop movie with all of its action and humor its what makes this movie basically some perfect good light entertainment to watch but it at the same time also makes this a quite simplistic movie that doesnt has much to offer storywise and because of its simplicity also never rises above the level of simply goodbut this doesnt really matter when watching this movie fore no one will of course watch this movie for its story or realism when watching this movie youll surely have a good time and you dont necessarily have to be familiar with or asian cinema or movies in general because this movie has basically nothing to do with or it doesnt follow any rules or logical and makes up its own stuff which is actually one of the movie its strongest points its unlike anything you have ever seen before in terms of its action and entertainmentwhat this movie mostly does is using the matrix techniques for all of its action applied to the games of that are played throughout this movie so you could call this a the matrix spoof though its more making fun of the entire movie genre by using the the matrix techniques and effects but at the same time the movie still manages to feel like a fresh and original enough movie on its own all of the games are done quite creatively but even when no games are being played the movie still manages to be a fun and entertaining watch which is also thanks to some good and likable characters that are all in itbiggest mystery of this movie is why there never was a sequel this movie was an huge success at the time globally and is still a quite popular movie to watch now days its one of the few movies i wouldnt had minded seeing getting a sequel there is still plenty of stuff to explore and put into a second movie without becoming a tiresome one or a simple rehash of the first movie surely there is still plenty of good and creative stuff to be shown during all of its gamesperfect harmless family entertainment710httpbobafett1138blogspotcom,comedy
this movie traverses the genre spectrum with broad strokes based on the title one could say its a sports related film about the importance of team work competition or triumph and failure though this is part action comedy and with dabs of dancing and life struggles thrown in if that wasnt enough most films cant handle the overload but manages to be a fun whimsical and downright entertaining and surprising ride because theres just so much going onthe of the cgi type is purposely exaggerated in a fantasycomedic way such as high flying jumps superhuman kicks and smashing headbutts that defy logic and plausibility steel leg stephen chows character works menial jobs although he wouldnt know it because hes got a positive outlook on whatever he does by chance he meets up with a failed player whos long past his due chow explains that martial arts can be applied to any way of life that involves movement first we see a woman about to slip on a banana peel a backflip would have saved her next we watch someone trying to parallel park easy just thrust your palms to move your car and of course theres which iron leg head and shirt techniques from shaolin temple come in handy as you might have guessed a partnership is made and then something out of an 80s movie ensues with quick training regimens to get ready for the big one that will prove themselves from getting sidetracked in other areas of lifeis overflowing with clichs such as good vs evil boy meets girl one upping your boss the weak rise up to be strong stand up for what you believe etc though this has passion and perseverance that can rub off onto to its viewers even if someone has to go back to the real world afterwards this is all done in an overthetop fashion thats wacky and zany enough to fall more in league with roger rabbit than a film like crouching tiger or sports movie such as bend it like beckham,comedy
stephen chow has a knack for combining impressive specialeffects interesting characters and hilarious comedy the prototype of hustle demonstrates many of chows strengths but the film does not rise to the same level of excellence as the later filmthe film relies heavily on making the characters as pathetic as possible but lacking the multilevel approach of hustle the characters just come off miserable at first and then suddenly get better for no reason the story also focuses too heavily on a central duo of characters and the badguys are left more to the backgroundthe film still has hilarious references and excellent visualeffects and gags which keep the viewer invested in the film but the structure is too straightforward and too simplistic to compete with chows later workhowever its entertaining and i guess thats what really counts,comedy
so most people watch movies expecting to see reality slightly altered for artistic or entertaining purposes right well anyone walking into a screening of siu lam juk kau hitherto referenced by its us title with this expectation will be disappointed the film ignores the basic tenets of conceptual physics to absurdity nevertheless its still a worthwhile film id recommend it for a beer fest or after consuming cannabis you may feel as if youve participated in both while watching itthe film opens with golden leg fung missing a penalty kick that would have won his team some undisclosed title he misses and is savagely beaten by the audience which results in his forced retirement his current employer hung conveniently happens to be the man who talked him into missing the kick hung refuses to allow fung to coach a team so fung wanders the streets he meets an idealistic former shaolin monk and convinces him to use his martial arts skills to play the young mighty steel leg sing gathers his former shaolin friends and they storm into the title and defeat fungs team evil players jump hundreds of meters into the air kick balls with such velocity that flames follow and break into thrillerinspired dance routines at mostly regular intervals this coupled with team evils sinister name and evil aura dark energy exudes the players create a good atmosphere for a parody film since the film isnt intended to be a parody director and star stephen chow never takes himself seriously neither does anyone else for that matter when wei zhou makes provocative gestures towards her team or when someone is getting a bottle smashed on his head the actors appear to be enjoying themselves the cgi is purposefully fake but especially surprising given the films age i havent seen cgi look as poorly incorporated into a film since mars attacks chow mentions how he wanted to create an animestyle film with impossible physical maneuvers he has and it has the same immeasurable camp that composes comedy animewill have a limited audience because of the degree of its camp which is alright most people would be wary of a film with such a title anyway however despite all the craziness in the acrobatics the characters remain true to their established identities the entire time sing and mui are consistent to their established personalities throughout the film most films like this one seem to drop any character development during the middle but this film doesnt sing is naive and idealistic even in success and mui is reserved despite her artificial beauty after she has an awful makeover this is epitomized when sing reveals that he isnt in love with her but sees her as an eternal friend a true wtf moment if we can have those while watching filmssure go on ahead and watch it why not youre unlikely to see a western film like this one that isnt completely corny with no redeeming qualities relies on good acting to keep suspension of disbelief in check while i dont know if id want to see it anytime soon it would be a great film for a prospective animator to watch a lot of effort went into that unconvincing cgi though personally i had my fill of it once the film endedps the new miramax dvd has the original version and the american theatrical release the dub eliminates most of muis interaction with sing as well as the important opening sequence the original version is  out of  while the dub is only two stars,comedy
very few comedies are worthy enough to enter my favourites list but rises above the rest and provides a comedic twist on the love it or hate it game of i had high standards going in to this stephen chow does have a reputation in hong kong his previous films were good for a few laughs but they were nothing special on the other hand is funny and well constructed above all its my favourite feelgood movie of all time its not just slapstick comedy here the best of both worlds can be found in this film so there is something for everyone to enjoy the animation is a little cheesy but it works well with the story and adds to the satirefinal verdict if you like comedies you should definitely check this one out even if you hate subtitles the film is equally funny in both languages english and cantonese hopefully this will draw you away from dry comedy and introduce something that is fresh and original,comedy
after bruce lee jackie chan and jet li comes stephen cho and his 2001 effort a football for us folks in the ukand martial arts combo with a bit of slapstick and comedy thrown in usually when we watch martial arts karate films there seems be an element of violence and bloodshed with people kicking the hell out of each other but here is used to a positive effect by means of teaching us that there is more to just punches and kicks and that sport can be fun and enjoyable thanks to chow himself he has reinvented what was considered by many to be a dying and outdated fighting genre of movie which was on its last legs for the 21st century movies were a success during the 70s and 80s but unfortunately by the late 90s onwards many of the hollywoodised and westernised martial arts flicks stripped away the core elements of asian action films and thus substandard efforts such as the matrix and rush hour movies put paid to this criticismhas many things special effects impressive ball juggling skills witty and humorous dialogue funny moments that keeps us glued to our screens chow is a delight on the screen his presence lights up the film and whilst his career didnt get off the mark until the mid 90s as such movies such as and hustle are an indication of the potential chow had and still has for that matter both as a writer director and actor the humour is a little reminiscent of the classic jackie chan films as it is very clean and clever not to mention the goalkeeper pays homage to the late great bruce lee what with his appearance bearing a resemblance to the yellow outfit he wore in enter the dragon just because its in cantonese shouldnt deter you from seeing this movie likewise with the theme even if youre not a sports enthusiast is still a great comedy effortchow may be a big star back in hong kong its such a shame hes not as big and known worldwide as his other socalled counterparts lee chan and li because his films need to be seen to be believed particularly hustle and this one if you love your footballthen id urge you to purchase this if you havent,comedy
this movie was hilarious in the whattheheckisgoingon sort of way its the kind of movie thats so far fetched that youre laughing out of disbelief but its fun in that way although i dont think itd hold up to a second viewing its kind of got the whole sam raimis evil dead 2 sort of thing going on except with less irony and more earnestness oh yeah and its a sports movie not a horror movie but the same sort of ridiculousness and extremity to it allits essentially the story about a loser guy who is troubled by the lack of in the world hes got an amazing kicking ability though and he teams up with his fellow masters to form a team to show that really is practical after all its just that everything about the film is absolutely overthetop and crazy think liveaction dragon ballits fun for a random night 710,comedy
i like to call this movie since the original name is a little hard to pronounce anyway back to the topic is hilarious with well plotted events was a shout out and perfect for the big game id like to say that steven chow is an excellent director and actor in his movie you can really think that characters are real because unlike american films his character even make some of the slightest moves rather than jumping on to the events like while someone talks instead of watching and keeping their faces straight they make some slight movements like twitching their noses or digging them so if the direction was excellent then so is the acting the character development is gooood now the movie who knew could be used for so many ways instead of just violence amazing isnt it steel leg and steel shirt are my favorites this movie is way better than a lot of movies it is better than even the famous bullet dodging matrix the cgi animation is well set and visuals are brilliant way cool,comedy
is a goofy comedy directed by the creator of hustle  one of the most original and laughable films one can find on earth while i can say that hustle is a feature equivalent of dragon ball series this one is respectively equivalent of captain tsubasas animated adventures in this film stephen chow uses practically the same formula the plot of is very simple its a kind of fromzerotohero story the main hero is trying to popularize and by the way become famous he hits upon a wonderful idea namely he tries to complete a team comprising of his ageing friends from school in order to participate in a breakthrough football tournament crossing all the limits the football matches transform into freaking battles in which superpowers of our characters play crucial role theres also love thread somewhere in between and implementing in bakery  is a hysterically funny film filled with absurdity all characters are overdrawn so as to make the movie even more ridiculous chow openly jeers here at common standards of the cinema typical storytelling and generic plots embellishing it with unsophisticated jokes nevertheless he does this cordially and without a bit of blast i definitely recommend this film containing so many unconventional ideas to the fans of parodies and absurd humour,comedy
i got to hand it to my library they had the uncut version of this movie so i can just skip right over the whatappearstobe brutally edited american release of this stephen chow seems to have found a niche find rather strange looking chinese people and endow them with super powers see hustle for another great example of this follows a down on his luck onetime famous player as he discovers a secret to putting a great team together mix shaolin with soon he finds a vagrant who is quite nimble with his feet he in turn recruits his brother who were also trained in the same form of kung0fu and they in turn compete to face the biggest baddest team in all the land drugs help im sorta glad i didnt see this in the theater uncut or not because i was giggling like a school girl throughout it theres some rather cool effects and dumb humor associated with it stephen chow is someone we should all be looking out for in the next couple of years because his star is just about to shine,comedy
this is a great sports martial artscomedy thats really entertaining and amusing with some really cool action and a fun story all the characters are cool and the story is really good as well plus the performances are pretty fun as well i happened to see the american release unfortunately however it was still great and it had some really awesome stunts and special effects as well plus the ending brought a big smile to my face its pretty well made and written and i thought the dubbing wasnt too bad either as it could have been a lot worse plus i loved it whenever the goalies told them to stop and to bring it and keep on shooting as it was really exciting those looking for martial arts action will be disappointed however thats not to say theres no martial arts involved because there is tons of it plus stephen chow plays an awesome lead the training scenes were really cool as well and it also has a cute love story between chow and zhao wei plus there is also some good dramatic moments as well this is a great sports martial artscomedy thats really entertaining and amusing with some really cool action and a fun story i highly recommend this one the direction is great stephen chow does a great job here directing too with awesome camera work solid angles and keeping the film at a very fast pace the acting is a lot of fun stephen chow is fantastic here as the lead he is charming very funny extremely likable had some cool moves is quite athletic and also has a great knack for comedy i loved him man tat ng is great as the sadness stricken coach he was quite likable i really dug him zhao wei is gorgeous and had a really cool character i really liked her her chemistry with chow was also on yin tse is great as the team evil coach he was a real asshole rest of the cast are fine overall i highly recommend this one 12 out of 5,comedy
i picked up the dvd of on a whim there was nothing else available to rent so i thought what the hell sounds like fun i never expected it to be so good the special effects are pretty amazing but its the imagination and thought thats been put into them that makes this movie specialthe plot is nothing particularly great usual sports movie fodder  team of misfits come good and beat the evil bad team but in amongst this is some classic physical comedy and martial arts looniness that will simply blow your mind unfotrtunatly the rest of the film cant match the action scenes and its really only the matches and fights that demand attentionnote  the dubbing in the english dvd version is really bad so its best to stick to the subtitleswho thought monks playing could be fun 710,comedy
its not so much the combination of hey dont blame me its the players who call it same with its the humour and dance more than anything else which makes this film sparkleconstantly this is a very irreverent poke at classic chinese mores and at the same time a similar dig at hong kong chopsocky productionsthis film doesnt have the excellent cinematic sweep of major asian movies what it does have is charm in spades there is romance pathos and sheer funwhat offers more than anything else is a fantastical look at the worlds major obsession with scoring the goala movie for the whole family,comedy
this mix of fantasycomedy and is actually quite a fun picture the basic plot line is about a washedup playerturnedcoach who turns a group of likable misfits who know into a super team and enters them in the championship tournament against his old rival who in turn has a juicedup team of his own the catch to this movie though is the inventive and stylish use of cgi to make play with the ball a truly amazing thing to witness for example during practice the main player director stephen chow of the good team yes the other one is called the evil team increases his accuracy by kicking the ball at a concrete target a hundred yards awayand each hit further deteriorates the wall another example is during a game a ball is kicked so hard it resembles a flaming spacecraft upon reentry and eventually turns into a roaring panther it may sound silly and it is but its also highly enjoyable to watch the humor is good too theres a great bit in the beginning that shows how an ancient shaolin master would deal with certain problems of the modern world,comedy
this is a very funny movie i absolutely loved it to be honest i did not know these guys could appeal to my particular funny bone  but they hit it many many times in this film i watched it 4 or 5 times and its the kind of movie that is funny each time but as you watch it again you notice a few more gags here and there they thought about the scenes and it shows in the resulti would love to see the version before this chopped up one it sounds very interesting oh yea i agree about the dance scene  it could have been left out  or made to fit abit more seamlessly  what i mean is it should have been made to tie in tighter to the shaolin effect on everyone the effect that is in all of us but we ignore because we are slaves to the daily grind that does not allow us to express our feelings really  i think thats what they were shooting for but it did not quite hit it dead onanyway thats what i thinkwell done mr chowmore please,comedy
the trailer made the movie seem somewhat of a serious theme with absurd special powers almost a crouching tiger hidden type deal this is not however the case which in my opinion is s greatest strength and weakness its a double edged sword 10s goofiness as the main character is apparent from the beginning of the film throughout hes not jackie chan but hes pretty darn close at times there is a lot of exaggerated slapstick throughout the film and sometimes the situations given made me feel a bit uncomfortable thus bringing me out of the immersion feel it took me a little bit to get my mindset right as to what kind of movie to watch this as a movie a comedy or an underdog sports story truth be told its a live action anime wrapped into two hours the plot is contrived had been done two thousand times by countless directors and such and nothing special the incorporated with obvious special effects has also been seen a million times and one would wonder if its enough to stand alone repackaged into is it enoughnofor the masses the selling point of will be the fun special effects used in the manipulation of the world most popular sportfor me however i think the humor mixed into the message of the movie was what charmed me the most albeit the martial arts in the were great to see in live action formatif youve seen the trailer watch the movie with an open mind ,comedy
i finally watched a hong kong dvd release of this movie and i have decided it was definitely worth the wait  despite subpar translations complete with spelling errors in the english subtitles this is a charmingly funny movie there were several things in the film that i do not think will translate well in american culture i am certain miramax has toned down or removed these parts  references to american performance enhancing drugs and a stereotype of a transvestite or transsexual hairdresser are almost certain to have been cut  i cant confirm that since miramax has seen fit to delay showing this movie for upwards of two years since i first saw an american trailer for the movie  shame on you miramax  the action is smooth and effects are decent for what i suspect is a small budget  the leads are appealing and carry off the roles well  i hope this movie gets a wider release from miramax even with whatever cuts they will have made as i think it could do well,comedy
this is without a doubt the best drinking movie ever even with the subtitles i really wish that it had been dubbed but it was still incredible my friends and i saw this at a movie theater that was next to a bar so we bought our tickets then ran next door and pounded drinks for 20 minutes before the movie started then we smuggled a few beers into the theater and had a couple as we watched the movie it may have been the most fun ive ever had it was hilarious this movie is like army of darkness but with instead of sheer badassness i definitely think everybody should see this movie but see it drunk and with a big group of friends its definitely a drunk big group of friends kinda movie,comedy
man what a great movie it was great times all aroundthis is definately an actioncomedy that will make you laugh so hard it is of very high quality and has really smart funny scenesonly downside is the excessive use of underpar cg oh well its definately worth it though if you want to see a great hk film that will make you laugh and that youll enjoy definately see this movie puhaha so see this movie its great see this movie alright thanks hybrd,comedy
this film is amazing it has a very unique sense of humor and is really quirky and just plain fun its so light hearted yet you get drawn in to the characters and their story it takes the sports genre as well as the genre to a new and fun place theres really something in this film for everyone its fast and fun to watch the humor is accessible for all ages and the story is engaging while also having a very positive message really cool visually its like the matrix on laughing gas its no wonder this film did so well abroad i just dont understand why it took so long to get released here and why that release is so very limited please if you have an opportunity to see this in the theater take it i love it,comedy
what a nice film the football is great the actors ar enthousiastic and sweet the jokes are funny and the special effects of course fantastic favourit scenes the girl with the dough and the start of the cupmatch 400,comedy
what a nice film the football is great the actors are enthousiastic and sweet the jokes are funny and the special effects of course fantastic favorite scenes the girl with the dough and the start of the cupmatch 400but see it in chinese because the american version is much shorter and the voices arent right please in cantonese,comedy
i have already seen the chinese version of this movie and it was great i am a great fan and the storyline was good it was cool how they did all those cool moves on the field and then they go into slow motion matrix style even though everything was just about impossible it still made me wish i had those powers,comedy
usually but this isnt your everyday sport movie sure its got the whole ragtagteamofunderdogstryingtoovercomeadversityandclinchthecup storyline like nearly every other sport movie ever made its got a halfarsed romantic subplot like nearly every other sport movie ever madebut the thing it has which all other sport movies lack is stephen chow ive been a fan of his since i saw from beijing with love on telly a couple of years ago to my mind its still the best bond sendup ever made ive managed to see some of his other movies since but none of them have been as funny as chow has taken what must have been a fairly simple idea and milked every conceivable possibility from it a bunch of former masters must rediscover their talents in order to win the world championship sounds a little silly well it is a little silly but thats kind of the point the secret to chows brilliance i think is that no matter what kind of craziness is going on around him hes just so cool about it he almost always delivers his lines with a totally deadpan expression think a much more talented leslie nielsen ala naked gun who is also cool goodlooking and buff okay hes not like leslie nielsen that was a bad comparison hes like any action hero you could name except that hes genuinely funny sure he hams it up a bit occasionally but only when its appropriate nothing ever seems laboured he doesnt just mug pointlessly likeer leslie nielsen a lot of other film comedians could learn from this man leslie nielsen for one okay ill stopas for the sequences well words cant do them justice youll just have to see them for yourself,comedy
this film is fun no matter what language you speak i had no subtitles yet i was intrigued from start to end fascinated with the scenery and overall tone which contained a spirit that no american film has captured in years i had a big zip pe de do dah grin on my head for pretty much the whole thing some of the shots gave me chills ive watched this 3 times in the last 2 days and been watching some scenes over and over againit accomplished its goal and will be remembered 10my first imdb review see this movie,comedy
810is the sort of comedy movie that would be turned into a joke if made in most other places but since it came out of a region that really cares for its cinema and wants to do more than shock viewers this was a great classic comedy the premise is bizarre but works once you see things unfold a shaolin practitioner is seeking a way to spread the word about his chosen art he meets a downonhisluck lame exfootball player who trains him and his five brothers to play football they form a team and are soon entered in a prestigious tournament with a 1 million dollar prize even cooler is the fact that this well made comedy has matrixesque fight scenes rock on the lead actor is very talented and i was to see more of his work this movie is soon to hit western shores on cinema with supposedly awful voiceovers go figure,comedy
im sitting in a taiwan hotel room on a business trip contemplating the sars scare scanning the channels and i see something that looks like a movie i have seen previewed in the states as some popular hk movie called a movie i wanted to see shock of shocks its the same movie i powered down my laptop and proceeded to laugh out loud all by myself in my room for the whole movie funny yes action yes wire work yes cgi as good as the matrix and oh lets not forget the minutes after seeing it i called my friends in the us on my dime not the companys and told them about it a must see a personal rating of worth standing in line for i then registered with imdb and here i am writing my first reviewi have never been so inspired into action like this for any other movie ive seen i have never seen a movie so funny so outrageous so over the top and so entertaining and clever yeah it is a feel good sports movie point here being that feelgood is not a bad thing but this one is in a class by itself there was rarely a moment when something outrageous was not happening there were laughs even up to the last minute of the movie the sight gags were cool the translation was hilarious the cgi was great the best humor was not isolated to the action on the field either although that is where the cgi humor shonesome may not like the mix of genres humor sports hk i feel sorry for them i guess they have a problem with the definition of inventive its not a crouching tiger or has a deep dramatic character driven plot jeez its just a comedy and the first hk comedy that made me laugh out loud which felt good when it hits the states i dont know what they will do with the english translation or what editing changes they may make but the original is absolutely great so all in all its a thumbs up could you tell and im sure that hollywood will reward it and its creators with its highest compliment imitation,comedy
what a great moviewhen i put the dvd in my player i was expecting a low budget corny martial arts film  hadnt heard of it so didnt know what to expect what i was presented with was the funniest most exciting film id seen in years from start to finish the pace never lets up and hold one of the greatest rise of a hero and his friends captured in filmi adored this movie for everything it had to offer it kept on supriseing me with its unique and unusual humour and comic book style special effects ive heard its being released in the west at cinemas the world wont know whats hit it ,comedy
first off a quick review of the movie itself in a word awesome its one of those movies you can watch over and over again and continue to laugh at the same parts as time goes on you even begin to do anticipatory laughs because you know the part to which youre looking forward will be coming up soonnow for the controversial statement mirimax owns the rights and will release a dubbed and slightly altered version of this to theaters in august moreover its going to be marketed as a kids movie and there is nothing wrong with that would work very well as a kids movie so more power to them for doing the reedit my only complaint about the domestic release is that much of the charm of the movie came from the awful subtitling job with such memorable quotes as the is over there but thats an acceptable casualtyif you want the original version its not as if its too difficult to find i got a legitimate regionless hong kong relase with english subtitles for less than the official us release will cost when it comes out get it for yourself but the one that comes out in august get that for your kids everyones happy,comedy
sports have never been my cup of tea and frankly i rarely understood the excitement of watching a bunch of guys chase a football across the field or discussing the results of another championship but hey these hongkong masters led by stephen chow made look fantastic even for me i have to admit it  ive already seen this movie about six times and i dont really think that id stop at that watching i always think one thing  hey this is the way to use cgi in movies funny exciting inventive lightningpaced  you should not miss this movie not in any way,comedy
low budget film spiced up with some of the latest cinematic tricks to bring to the big screen  although u must suspend your disbelief the effects are done tastefully  not tacky all the elements of a good story character development coupled with a soundtrack to immerse you in the experience  whether it be funny or sad  its certainly an enjoyable film throughout and touching too  a rare 10 from me,comedy
i love this movie dont be fooled by the trailer of the american version ive seen the original but i cant imagine that even the worse recut and dub can make this a bad movie go see it at the theater or you will regret it later,comedy
i watched a badly subtitled fulllength version of this movie in its original language and there are no words to describe how well it succeeds as a comedy  so much so that the comedic moments catch you by surprise i say this because the overlycritical western audience will inevitably be lulled into thinking that it is simply a poorly written action film set in a match  i think its a pity that its been renamed to for release in the us  its about an unlikely bunch of shaolin monks ganging together to advertise the shaolin way through the medium of coached by a crippled aging former star  is a much better title and they should have left it at thatdid i mention the  my god this is sheer genius  the matches are extremely funny to watch but the players sporadically manifest their special godlike abilities that turn the field into an olympian battle between good and evil  the special effects are noticeable but these scenes are nonetheless amazing to watch  no they dont break out into fighting  instead the ball simply gets kicked around at what looks like a significant fraction of the speed of light and you get to watch it in matrixlike bullettime  and thats not the half of ittheres some romance between the star player and a fetching babe named mui who bears her own share of comedy  nothing in this movie takes itself seriously least of all their relationship  still her role in the movies final match will have the audience cheering  not to spoil it for you but this girl has her own godlike skill that has nothing to do with brute strength yet is just as effectivein fact this whole movie is full of unexpected surprises  the soundtrack is great gladiator quality even the matches are like nothing youve ever seen the humor is perfectly timed and delivered the characters are extremely likeable and unpretentious and some of the scenes are so priceless that youll find yourself watching the movie over and over just to see them  i know i didim giving it a 910  i hope the dubbed version will not be a horribly mangled edit of the original,comedy
nothing i can tell you will make you want to see but believe me its something you have to experience at least one time if you didnt think crouching tiger was stupid because it was unrealistic then i have a feeling youll enjoy the insanity of peoples reviews have been pretty harsh because this film is outlandish and almost completely implausible but these people have lost touch with the fact that this is a movie what happened to the days when you went to the theater to be taken away from your everyday life  i applaud for not being afraid of having imagination this is a fantastic movie to watch with others and enjoy the craziness because not many films will make you want to press play again as soon as the dvd finishes,comedy
man this movie is impossible to define good bad no its beyond actors arent that good shooting is not that good and quite often it recalls old style trash bmovies from the 70s but it sure is cool it reminded me of that old japanese cartoon about football or if youre in usa only this is a real movie during the final game i was crying from laughter and deeply touched by the amazing climax of overdriven coolness that seemed not to ever come to an end what next you keep on asking yourself and the problem is that it keeps on going and going and you just stay there with your mouth open laughing in awe,comedy
saw this movie about a 1 year ago import dvd from hong kong and i and my friend who watched it with me we just sat there and laughed and was stunned by the amasing effects this movie providesthis is a very well shot film with tons of humour stephen chow has really managed to put this nice piece of work togheterthe effetcs in the movie bullet time looking stuff and much more looks just great and yeah when that hits the market im sure im going to the arenas aswell 1010 from me,comedy
may not be the best among chows movies it is definitely the most entertaining film of his chow put more focus on body humors which would be understood by international audiance instead of localized hong kong pop culture which he is well known offor viewers who are crazy with his localized performance will find out of their expectation for viewers merely watched chows film it is a very good start to initiate your interest in watching his other movies,comedy
after seeing the trailer for this movie i knew i had to see ita quick search online and two weeks later my wish came truethis is one of the most unique films ive ever seenbeing a fan of asian cimemai enjoyed this film a great dealthe special effects are awesome and the cast is incredibly charminganyone expecting a fight fest could be diappointed as is played mostly for laughs but there are the occasional brawls to spice things up between the jokescome to this movie with an open mind and your tongue firmly in cheek and you will have a blastif youre like me and have seen the trailer you may want to look for an import copy instead of waiting until august for the miramax releaseprovided you dont mind reading subtitles that isoverall this is great movie for its target audiencehence if you are reading this review youll probably get a kick out of 810,comedy
this movie is brilliant in its parody of both traditional martial arts films as well as the craze over in all countries except america  there were too many moments that warranted so much laughter that i was on the verge of choking  just go watch it and stop reading this review if you can manage reading subtitles and are not closeminded to foreign films 1010,comedy
this movie is amazing spectacular exciting crazy comic mixes with and comedy it as brilliant visual effects and nonstop action what more do you want this movie is definitely worth seeing,comedy
firstly the copy of i saw has terrible subtitles one of the main protagonists is annoyed he is going blad and the coach tells his players to kick the i hope its sorted out for the english language marketsnow with that out of the way i can start to tell you what a great film this isstarts with a flashback to a game of football we see golden leg taking an understudy to task golden leg named in the same sort of conventions as high mountain wonder fist and the like after golden leg misses a free kick the crowd invade the pitch and break his golden leg with a bat and kick the crap out of him all the while the understudy smirks on cut to the future and the understudy is now chairman of hks premier tournament and his own evil team he also treats the now crippled golden leg very badlygolden leg now runs into shaolin iron leg who offers to teach him golden leg refuses until he sees how great a kick iron leg can be now they have something to teach each otherand with the aid of iron legs misfit shaolin brothers and some kids they beat up in a game they form the mightiest football team in hong kong except the super soldiers in evil team who they have to fight for the championshipif this all sounds preposterous well it isss incorporates all the stormridersesque cgi and bullet time type special effects with superb physical comedy the shaolin is great song is hilarious the result is a superb mish mash of styles that never gets boringthe funniest thing is how the shaolin actually play they basically run it into the penalty area and try and kick it at the goalie so hard it breaks his arms they do this again and again until they score no one defends once the other team are in a shooting position and everyone just stands there open mouthed as the striker takes harder and harder shots at a progressively more injured keeper to anyone who has any interest in football this is just hilarious to pick up and criticise the football or lack of it in is like criticising blazing saddles for its inaccurate portrayal of the wild westis simply a great film it is fun isnt too violent and is generally spectacular i reckon its suitable for the whole family if they are old enough to keep up with subtitles they are old enough to watch in my opinionsure its stupid but so what its the child like charm of the whole thing that makes it so endearingand the end where everyone knows is just superb,comedy
if youve seen some old classic hong kong movies you will recognize the elements theyre making fun of its funny when you understand the underlying humorthe movie features quite a few computeranimated effects and stands out as a modern film in this sence the actors may not be of the best but for this kind of movie it doesnt matter in my opinion,comedy
well ill be pretty short the movie itself features gorgeous special effects noticeable especially because this is a chinese movie i liked the humor alot and ive jumped quickly over the dramatic scenes which couldnt miss from the movie  very impressing effort from the movie makers they managed to put together great action and traditional fantasy all built on an exotic mix and shaolin fighting techniques such a movie was expected after many animated series featuring handball or the bunch of sega nintendo and gameboy games based on as many of you might know such games were always packed with special moves and special charactersits a movie you have to see,comedy
genuinely hilarious with fantastic martial arts sequences and the kind of musical wordplay jokes that make me wish i could understand chinese im sure the dodgy subtitles dont do it justice but the fact that it often had me laughing my socks off has to say something its a wellacted warm affectionate inspiring and very amusing movie open your mind be prepared to read subtitles that flash past at 100mph and youll have a whale of a time i wouldnt swap it for all the jet li flicks in the world,comedy
funny chinese movie its would be more interesting for funs the story began 20 years ago when the great player broke his legand now hes a coach with a team of shaolin monks every game is an incredible and mystic show of tricks amazing special effects underlying confrontation of the coach and his foe love story good music and and some chinese species of course  810,comedy
a thoroughly entertaining film from beginning to end even if like me you are scrambling to keep up with the subtitles  the storyline never loses its power to move the audience as chow integrates wonderfully unexpected and original comedic images from the kickoff of the tournament to muis dramatic march during the final match  simply the most fun ive had viewing a film in years,comedy
this movie was very impressive and very funny a pleasure to watch even if at little times it was a bit slow when the action of the game came it each time surprises you again what i most liked here is the originality of the actions and the scorings most movies once they have 1 effect they use it over and over again here it seems many times new effectswith a bigger budget this movie would have erased some other special effect movies like matrix or terminator 2 anyway great work much originality good laughing and this is something you never never seen before finally something completely new and especially that i hate well if it could be this way i would probably love it,comedy
stephen chow is one of my favourite actor in hongkong entertainment industry most of his movies were comedy not to exclude this one the plot questioned whether chinese martial art can still survive in the present where it was shown to be a very stressful ignorant place for most people or to be more precise whats the use of learning martial art these days other than for selfdefense chow came up with the idea of packaging chinese martial art in a modern way such as singing and dancing the idea was badly performed accidentally the idea of using chinese martial art in appeared and hence the real story beginsoverall the movie had a lot to say to the public especially for hongkong people who were portrayed as stressful ignorant busy and dont dare to face challenges the martial art itself was overemphasized and became humorous as the story wenti would give 85 out of 10 for this movie,comedy
the us title for this is as opposed to this is a pity as people who dont like martial arts films will avoid it this is not a film in fact theres virtually no in it indeed fighting of any sortits a classic sporting underdog film a shaolin practitioner is looking for a way of bringing his to the masses and with the help of a disgraced former football star gets together with his disillusioned shaolin pals and enters a tournament what you end up with is probably the funniest film of the last couple of years with a bit of everything in it quite simply it has to be seen to be believeda word of warning  this is a review of the original cantonese film available on dvd the film is one of many from hong kong recently bought up by buenavista for release in the united states and is to be released early in 2003 in a dubbed reedited and generally butchered form presumably to make it more palatable to morons ive seen the trailer for this new version and its hideous,comedy
who is the biggest movie star in hk your answer would be jackie chan chow yun fat or jet li unbelieveably you are wrong it is stephen chow after his first breakthrough du sheng all for the winner most of his movies have been on the top ten list in hk however his dame works only in hk becaus only hk viewers fully understand his comdey its like woody allen movies for new yorkers siu lam juk kau is an exception most of comic scenes are slapstick so even you dont know kantones chinese and todays hk society you can enjoy it but if you are a stephen chows long time fan you might be disappointed little bit like these days adam sandler chows gave up his original style for more viewers still this is very fun buy watch and laugh,comedy
this movie was the funniest thing i saw this year i couldnt stop laughing at the action sequences  the characters were really funny they do have a great chemistry while acting as a family  see this movie if you can you wont regret it  the plot was simple and the graphics were okay nothing special but they had some imaginative stuff that i never thought ive see in a movie really original and great to watch it with a group of people or even by yourselves  the only problem the film had was that the characters were speaking to fast and i had to go back to read the subtitles every time i missed an important line but mostly the funny stuff doesnt happen while they are talking anyway is just the action sequences that are worth the rental or the dvd it just hilarious  if you are fluent on the cantonese then this movie is for you if you dont speak the language take time to read the subtitles so you dont get lost while watching this film is worth seeing it,comedy
this movie will do some very amusing things to your facial muscles most enjoyers of cinema have come to accept that the onscreen action will carry the viewer from beginning to end with only a loosely woven plot holding the whole ragtag thing together it becomes apparent quite early in that this is not just another hk film the story unravels itself easily and its seamless editing and overthetop special effects wonderfully emphasize plot and character development the scene transitions are playful and engaging and although some effects are a bit obvious they do nothing to detract from the suspension of disbelief its just too fun to be a part of what this movie offers it is first and foremost a testament to the art of entertainment secondly divulges a great many reasons for everybody to learn and sing,comedy
i was waiting for long time to see a good comedy i saw it twice in the same day and im still laughing when i recall some sequences i appreciate the original language also the film is spoken in chinese they suck those movies dubbed in english without sincronisation between the characters mouth and the sound you hear it definitely worths to be seen,comedy
this movie has everything  technique  wisdom hate pride  suppression love  romance fun fun fun overthetop action sequencesyoull love this straightforward crazy kickass movie  its even better when you dont like ,comedy
there are two global commedies of stephen chow and is one of them the other is fight back to school stephen chow has many excellect commedies but they are too local and depended on lines too much only hong kong people could have fun from those if you dont know cantonese and hong kong culture you will have less fun from his films but obviously he changed his style in the fundamental of screenplay is simple but impressive i promise the jokes of could make everyone in the world laughing if you watched and find it great you should watch fight back to school its also suitable for foreign audiences,comedy
my twin sister gave me a copy of the movie and she described it as a movie with matrix like special effects  i wasnt totally sold on the idea cause i find sometimes chinese movies to be too quirky for my tastes but man this movie totally had me laughing my ass off  what a great idea  the movie had me in total awe and grinning from beginning to end  i thought this summers movies totally sucked and were no where near the enjoyment i had with this movie  even though some of the effects looked somewhat fake i still bought into it cause the itself is pretty amazing hopefully they dont butcher it to death or use awful dubbing when it hits the states highly recommended  this is one of those movies where you have to invite all your friends over to watch  but then again i did watch this by myself and i still had a great time  its that funny,comedy
first saw this film at a scifi con in atlanta  was utterly mesmerized by the level of humor and action in it  easily one of the funniest films i had ever seen  not whats up tiger lily funny but what is highly recommend that if you see this film somewhere you buy it,comedy
i saw a usa preview for this movie and thought to myself what an awesome and quirky idea for a movie  i watched the hong king cut with subtitles the usa trailer made it look like a kids movie kind of like a cool hong kong version of lady bugs  it was not at all  it was a very well thought out and executed movie about shaolin and just like the title says  right  the plot is put together just like several sports andor movies  gather the team train then fight the big fight or play the big game actually they are synonymous in this filmthe special effects were used only when needed and looked great  there are funny takeoffs on the matrix jurassic park and bruce lees game of death  i actually laughed out loud several times and grinned most of the rest  if you can get the dvd i recommend doing so though it is hard to do now  disneymiramax is releasing the film dubbed and has exclusive distribution rights so they have put a stop to overseas sales of the movie look around though and youll find it out of hong kong  cheers and i hope you enjoy it too,comedy
this absolute stonker of a movie will have you rolling in the isles with its in yer face laughs fast pace surprises and takes on various aspects of martial arts it stole my heart they might not know much about the offside rule in hong kong but who gives a toss with the fx drenched kung football scenes on the pitchdont think just see it,comedy
is the second film ever to get a personal mark of 11 on my own scale of 1  10 the other is snatch the effects are awesome the humor varies from subtle to slapstick and is always funny the plot is inspired or a result of eccentricy the translations are pretty not good with scarce a sentence go by thats grammatically correct but you more than get used to it you latch on to it do not buy a dubbed version if such becomes available the explosion song and the song are completely classic performances are marvelous all around muis boss though only a supporting character is superbly acted the movie lacks nothing and is full of many many scenes to reenact later with buddies qmc,comedy
warning this commentarticle contains spoilers do not read unless you wish to     this movie brough me tears and lots of it many points of the story may not be explained well but there is a meaning to it a bum in the streets who has the will to practice his martial arts but is just out of ideas he comes up with an idea with a guy be meets in the streets as well they gather their old martial arts teammates or brothers and build a amateur team to fight off the evil team the evil team      before all of this almost all their brothers had lost their martial arts power forgotten about it and gone off to live another life as they work their way up from sucking terribly they remember their powers gather again and work their way up to the championship with the support of this bun worker he meets in a bun shop at the end they defeat the evil team in their crazy ways and win        ever since that day everyone uses martial arts with things such as parking the car cutting the trees etc this movie also had many hilarious points trust me buy it watch it several times or when ever your friends come over lend it to your friends and relatives trust me if they dont laughyou got a dull lifefilled with nonemotional peoplejeezexcellent movie 8 out of a 10,comedy
this is one of those genredefying movies that makes you laugh while thrilling you  the acting storyline and premise are wonderful throughout and the soundtrack is great essential for the overarching feeling that is conveyed  i love this movie  deep down it is the story of a group of losers finding the fire within and succeeding against all odds 10 out of 10,comedy
considering i detest to its very core it is surprising how much i love this movie  this is one of the funniest comedies ive seen well ever the story is easy enough to follow even in the subtitled version  a group of exshaolin monks who are now average joes and nobodies are brought together after much hilarious encouragement by their coach a crippled explayer  their mission to defeat the evil team headed by a teammate and now rival of their coach  the prize  fame and fortune as well as starting a shaolin craze city widesome people have complained about the poor english subtitling  i dont mind the subtitling at all it just adds to the humor of the film  why am i going blad one character says  he meant bald but its funnier with the typo  also they refer to a ball simply as the  the is over there how can you kick it  priceless  the film does have its intentional humor too  in fact its bursting at the seams with it  from the hilarious scene with 6th little brother determined to get his egg back to quite possibly the worlds worst nightclub performance ever this film will leave you in stitches you dont have to know or get any of the chinese in jokes like the california dreaming melody just take one look at the jamaican team and its enough to make anyone in any country laughtheres little display of martial arts in the traditional sense of martial arts films however this is not a martial arts film its a comedy having said that dont think its totally devoid of action rest assured theres a good ass kicking or ten placed appropriately in this film  on a scale of 9 starts i give this movie an 18 it really is that damn good,comedy
first of all this isnt a sports movie rotfl and actually you dont even have to be a fan to enjoy this movie a different kind of humor and a soft spot for video games would be helpful thoughand although i highly recommended this film i wouldnt nearly know how to describe it well just watch this movie,comedy
sorry if this is a bit long tch the guy who said this was utterly unwatchable crap and everyones saying its good because of the crouching tiger effect either thats a jealous director from another studio or somebody having a seriously bad day like a day so bad that not even this movie could brighten things upwith my comment theres certainly no cthd effect  didnt know that it was anywhere near so popular until i ended up here found the downloaded file on my brothers computer was just looking for a menuinlay cover graphic to put on my crappy little homemade vcd version 115m on one disc baby yeah vbr is your friend so i can play it to pcphobic friends it is a genuinely cool film after watching it was kinda pissed off that it didnt show at all in the uk around the time of its original release  much like princess mononoke only got to hear of it after the fact and it showed at like 5 cinemas will have to look for the dvd now as this download must have been taken from a pirate tape it really is rubbish quality  and other stuff by steve chow never heard of him before who says the internet eats into salesso what if a western infidel like myself doesnt get some of the jokes or misses some completely we can still pick up an inkling of whats there and puzzle over it awhile and the rest of them that are far more obvious are good enough to stand on their own the slightly messed up subtitles slightly off translations  i have come here for the playing and typos are all it amounts tothe plot if somewhat hackneyed in its overall style has been given a nice enough twist and certainly isnt the usual sickly hollywood take on it theres a nice touch of substance underneath what with the subplot between sing and mui  not the usual easy love at first sight movie romance and the farelly bros and steve mcqueen have given us easily enough stomach to deal with the raw egg noshing grossness of tubby weight vest weightless the action sequences what can be said they are matrixycool if ever so slightly less believable but then we are talking overthetop hk styled shaolin stuff here overdone wire work is what weve come for goddamnit and no the football matches are far far from anything you might see on the pitch in real life but then people dont use mystical shaolin powers to bound clear over the top of the opposition so cut slack there toothe dance scene what can be said both balatantly poking fun at and beating the ass of the average bollywood cheesefest at the same time no actually just poking fun what am i saying bootlegs are good no cuts plus outtakesa solidly good film that its hard to pick bad points in the purposeful covering up of muis decidedly pretty face with straggly hair and heatscars is one though its a plot point the fact that only six or seven of the twelvestrong 11  sub team the ones who have the shaolin training actually play much of an active role is another just what exactly do they do just stand out there making up the numbers and going along for the ride hmmmmmm and check out the amount of lowkey gender bending ooshaolin zheng ohho yeah decent tuneage for a hk film then again havent seen much that were made after 85 im british but the rules have to be twisted for once is a much snappier and better title than footballall in all more interesting than the england vs sweden opening world cup match was and more or less the same length 810 at least,comedy
this movie is absolutely positively incredible is a must see  it was harilious along with continous action  the special effects and action were full packed  it freaking kills 90 of the hollywood movies in the united states being made lately  i recommend it to anybody,comedy
i saw this movie as a free sneak preview  i thought it would be the worst movie ive seen since corrina corrina  it started out all hardcore and i thought it would be your runofthe mill horrible sports feelgood movie mights ducks the big green etc  then about 5 minutes in the movie begins to add unnecessary scenes that are hilarious  granted i could have done without the lead female she was filthy for no apparent reason however the team is the best thing ive ever scene  watch for the guy who is able to keep the ball on his abdomen its pure movie magic  may not look like much when you see the commercials but it will be the best thing youve seen in a while as long as you havent seen anything real good in a while,comedy
if i could sum up in 3 words it would be absolutly freakin amazing never have i seen a hong kong movie done so well to the point that it rivals any hollywood made films is bar none the greatest movie to come out of hong kong ever i have watched this movie at least 30 times since ive bought the dvd and i plan on seeing it many more time the plot in this movie is very thin and has been repeated many times in hollywood movies such as mighty ducks bad news bears and the english patient have used this plot ok maybe not the english patient its basically the classic story of the underdogs beating the odds and acheiving their goals through determination and teamwork the story itself revolves around mighty steel leg sing a post graduation shaolin practitioner looking for a way to spread the teachings of shaolin in a brandnew modern day package to the masses after meeting up with golden leg fung a shamed former player who took a bribe to miss a goal they decide to form a team with sings other shaolin brothers each having his own personal skill the end scene where our shaolin heroes must face the evil team is probably one of the greatest moments ever captured on celluloid next to the maggot barfing dog from bones nothing beats that is a movie for anyone who likes martial arts for anyone who likes and generally anyone who likes movies this movie gets a 1010 from me and it should get the same from you stephen chiau is a fckin genius,comedy
first here in england we always refer to it as football noone calls it  just thought id say that as i know that a lot of americans call it and to them a football game is a totally different game and i will almost certainly use football instead of in this review  anyway in a nutshell the plot revolves about stephen chows attempts to package shaolin in a way that a mass audience would take to  with the help of an ex player now a cripple after an accident that happened after taking a bribe he attempts to recruit his former shaolin brothers to help him form a football teami watched this film based on recommendations which mentioned the football matches themselves but i didnt see one that said just how funny the thing was  i will admit that there are a lot of moments in the film that you will either find horrendously cheesy or hilarious for example the two forwards of the team they face in the semis  a pair of girls disguised as men the brothers provide a lot of the comedy some of which is priceless i defy anyone not to laugh at part of the training involving some eggs  of course each brother brings there own skill to the team fat guy who can jump incredible heights guy with iron head guy with powerful stomach and of course the star chow who has an incredibly powerful shotas for the action the film is good but really kicks into gear during the final match against the steroid pumped evil team great name you know that the film isnt taking itself too seriously  this is where the film goes into full on ott mode including shots at goal that leave scorch marks balls turning into pumas and shots that literally tear peoples clothes off  its a fantastic climax to the film brilliantly directed and worth seeing the film for this part alonei recommend seeing this  the film is already available on dvd and is region free so you have no excuse for not getting it its a hong kong dvd though but all the extras have subtitles and i doubt that the film will get as good a dvd treatment in the west  theres even a follow the white rabbit style feature and a dts track  which is awesomevery good  810,comedy
i popped the hong kong dvd of this film on the player in the media room of our company today before long the whole room was filled with people oohing and aahing at the fantastic dramatic score the awe inspiring pans and the incredible special effects the story is a silly trifle but dont let that stop you from having a great time with this filmif you like this one i recommend god of cookery king of beggars or king of comedy,comedy
over the years hong kong cinema has borrowed from sources from all over the world rarely does it use such diverse ingredients to produce such a complete solid and outstanding piece of entertainmentthis spans all genres from laugh out loud funny moments to dramatic tension whilst seamlessly integrating a host of amazing special effectsafter hollywood used computer effects to create dinosaurs and toys they ran out of imagination chow sing chi has stepped in and used the technology in a new direction  to enhance what a real human can achievethis is a triumph for everyone involved and shows a new direction for others to follow,comedy
this is a fantastic film  it has some cutting edge special effects the cinematography is outstanding and the acting is topnotch  however if youre a steven chow fan you probably wont find yourself rolling on the floor in tears laughing  more likely youll be on the edge of your seat in awe  dont get me wrong  this film is still a steven chow comedy but its not as funny as many of his films  this film is a bit more mature than his past efforts  theres still the element of silliness here but so much time was spent making the audiences jaw drop with special effects that there wasnt much time left for laughing  its just good to see steven chow back on the screen again thoughsteven chow plays a poor guy whos main focus in life is shaolin he wants the world to learn and he thinks it could help everybody he meets a man who wants to be a coach and eventually they figure out that it would probably be a good idea to merge the two  this film follows the formula of many sportscomedies  the underdog team assembled from unlikely heros pitted against the uber team here this team is even named the evil team trying to win against all odds and at all costs  this film has a new spin on the genre of course and its a refreshing change  as in all steven chow films there is a love story as well  something for everybody  i havent yet seen the extended version but im eager to  i loved this filmthis isnt his funniest film by any means but its certainly his most technically advanced film  the thing that gets me is that they can spend so much time and money on the special effects but then present the film with a terrible looping job  the audio is often out of sync as if it was rushed or else the actors didnt care when they went into the studio to loop all their dialogue  still  i give this film an 810  i highly recommend this film  even to steven chow newcomers just know that hes much much funnier than this in other films  its available on dvd and vcd in hk  both very cheap from online retailers  the vcd is the shorter version and the quality is not that great but its in stereo instead of the left channel handling cantonese and the right channel handling mandarin  there are burnedin subs in 3 different languages english included  the dvd has a dts track and is the extended version of the film  shell out the extra few bucks for the dvd if you plan to buy it which you should,comedy
is my very favorite movie of all time and it will be everything in this movie is just right since last summer ive seen it more than 50 times and still  i cant wait to see it again my favorite scene is that chow and his brother play guitars and sing a song in a club soooooo gooooood,comedy
ive always expected a lot from singchi  always has the brains for a nobrainer comedy strange isnt it who says it has to make sense for this type of comedy  his twoyear absence really paid off and seeing this movie was a great experience  the movie had many elements mixed in comedy action drama sfx and of course  from watching so many of his movies this is singchis funniest concoction that ive ever seen  it had kept me entertained and laughing in some great moments thats its worth the chance of viewing more than once  no hk fanatic should miss this it is indeed one of the best hk films from 2001  even though miramax has it brought this spring id recommend getting the official hk dvd that is if they have it,comedy
what can i say  is definately one of the all time stephen chow greats  its funny it is very well directed especially the wide shots of the games and it actually has a few serious moments  i really got into the film although i knew it was going to be a spoof i didnt realise there was going to be that much cg graphics in the movie but that just enhanced the film more the end match had so many special moves and over the top martial arts it was like seeing a manfred wong comic a must watch for fans and nonfans alike especially if you like king of comedy,comedy
as a fan of classic movies and wanting entertainment more than anything out of movies i just loved this one best comedy action ever i fear even master jackie chan is threatened now  never seen such excelent specialeffects used to such excelence hollywood in general really has something to learn from this film in ways of aplying effects to comedys enjoy this truly great movie everyone,comedy
better then the mighty ducks on crack this international delight mixes shaolin and i thought it would suck not being the sport movie fan but i was proven very very wrong by the sight of chinese actors being flung around a field in matrixstyle great,comedy
is one of the funniest hong kong comedy movies ive ever seen stephen chows films are getting better and better the special effects bx centro are as always almost perfect and make the film even funnier check out the directors cut version on the hong kong dvd it includes the best dance performance evers seen 10 points,comedy
is one of the best movies ive seen in a long time  its slapstick comedy without being overthetop an excellent meld of oneliners and awesome special effects and amazing martial arts  i was dying of laughter the entire way through it  it is imperative to see this movie in its original the us is planning to release it but to alter it form by changing the name the music cutting scenes and dubbing voices  i truly feel they will only ruin stephen chows hilariously captivating film is definitely recommended as one of my top favorite movies of all time,comedy
this film is funny and entertaining stephen chowmy favourite comedian had done his best in this film the visual effects are great this is the best chinese comedy film i have ever seen watch it or you will regret it theres a rumour saying that there will be a sequel of this film soon and i hope it is true,comedy
this is the best special effects movie since the matrix add to this hilarious humor crazy ideas and in general extreme coolness its hard for people in the west to judge the acting but it works fine anyhow cause we do understand the jokes perfectly using subtitles basically its a great film and i wonder why it hasnt had any publicity in the westwhether you like the humor or not its hard to argue against the sfx like in other films dealing with this much sfx a lot of cgi has been used but definitely not overused it just have this certain amount of coolness which is if you havent seen it pretty damn hard to describe,comedy
in a town where doing 3 to 6 films in a year can be the norm for a star and stephen chow is unequivocally the star amongst the stars of hong kong i counted 10 films with him in it for 1991 quality is generally not a consideration from some brilliant comedy in his earlier days the hong kong audience had to suffer the low quality output of chows films over recent years then all of a sudden there was a twoyear drought of his creations but now lo and behold the comedy king is backfirst and foremost is not a movie so to all you martial arts buffs out there drawn by the shaolin brand name be warned oh sure theres fighting and a whole lot of talk about mystical shaolin styles but its all a backdrop to what the movie is all about and so what is it about you say well its really about taking a poke at movie clichs especially martial arts movies with very clever usage of wellknown cinematic moments so if youre well up on your hong kong flicks and steven spielberg type blockbusters then youll find this movie a hootstephen chows brilliance not only shines through via his visual display of some fantastically repackaged slapstick but also his dialogue is some of the cleverest ive ever heard from him and how does one translate a country bumpkin cantonese accent so those of you who have to suffer the atrocious subtitling sorry cause youre missing half the film a fellow moviegoer mentioned that he felt stephen chows directing has matured well chow certainly matured by taking his time with this moviei took my parents to watch they usually prefer trois couleurs bleu types or the latest at the theatre and guess what they thought it was the best movie that they had seen in 2001  same for me,comedy
i regularly watch the western union world football show and they had a short segment on stephen chow and the movie  knowing his other movies this one looks great  during the interview it sounded like this was a project that chow wanted to do for a while and he really enjoyed making ithis first step was to do research on combining and to see what had been done before  he was surprised and pleased to find out that nothing had been done before he had a clean slate to do what he wantedi can only hope that it will be released in the us  it sounds like it is doing very well in hong kong which bodes well for its release in the us,comedy
although this movie may not be the greatest masterpiece of 2001 it is indeed a fascinating movie for people that are not familiar with stephen chows work the plot involves a stray and penniless shaolin student with the task to spread the teachings of shaolin to all the world when the opportunity comes to use his to play he calls his brothers out of retirement to help him challenge the undefeated evil team on the china allstar championship excellent cg special effects make a great part of this movie and surprises the audience that still expects to see wires and bouncees even with all the technology involved it still manages to retain that special bmovie charm that makes this movie light and enjoyable and will make you see it again and again an excellent addition to any collection,comedy
i saw this movie last year in chinaemphasis on saw because my chinese isnt good enough to understand exactly what was going on still the visuals themselves have enough comedic humor to keep an audience entertained and i cant wait to see how the movie will play in america with subtitles just imagine the matrix crossed with a goofy sports movie ie the mighty ducks where each character makes one contribution to the team effort and youll see where it goes fun and amusing and steven chow while fairly serious here seemingly deserves his nickname as the asian jim carrey reccommend it though the new name of doesnt work quite as well as ,comedy
brilliant just brilliant some of the funniest action sequences in any movie since jackie chans earlier work it has everything an action fan wants heavy action a good story larger than life heros and villains the story itself is easy to follow revolving around mighty steel leg and his quest to fullfil his deceased masters wish to spread shaolin after a false start he meets with golden leg fung a former star whos fallen from grace together they create the teambest movie ever,comedy
 i wanted to see this both because i like martial arts films and because i am fascinated by movies from other cultures as a martial arts film it is heavy on special effects in a way similar to crouching tiger hidden dragon but dont expect an artsy movie this is pure lowlife pop its a fantasy comedy about an incredibly downtrodden ex player and an incredibly downtrodden family of masters they team up and bring us on a classic ragstoriches journey the characters are sad caricatures but you cant help but be excited to see them win there is alot of humor in the movie mostly of the sight gagslapstick variety in a modern context but it works i enjoyed this movie as a stupid movie but it pretends to be nothing else,comedy
not too hard to describe really guy who is a practitioner of shaolin wants to promote it to the rest of the world and ends up putting together a team that uses to play and win its supposed to be partly a comedy but most of that went right over my head what remains is pretty amazing though  youve never seen like this before,comedy
at least until i saw harry potter  stephen chow is a comic geniussp he knows the best comedy is when the actors play it straight  that characters dont have to be over the top half wits to be funny  with his tongue planted firmly in his cheek stephen chow takes a rather run of the mill sports plot and creates a laugh out loud gem lavish special effects only add to the humor and constant poking fun at film genres and conventions  only the occasional grossness of number 6 younger brother doesnt translate well to american  also the pathetic subtitles add and extra level comedy for us english speakersim hoping that rumors ive heard of a us release of the film this year are true,comedy
you better release this film earlier to capture the marketit is the same story theme of a bunch of rejects winning big championship as underdogs that have no respect by anyoneactually capturing the afc championship is enough for a movie and what is better is one that is readily available instead of football we have the characters are quite simple david patten and troy brown almost not made it in nfl and brady is a nobody in the beginning of the season,comedy
this movie is definitely one of if not the best hk movie to come out in 2001  im a big stephen chow fan who loves almost everything he does but in this film he even manages to catch the attention of people who cant stand his other films  unlike a lot of other hk movies that are trying to reach higher production values  this film not only succeeds but doesnt forget those other important parts like story and acting look at geny cops for an example of poor storyacting with big budget effectsa lot of the humor is particular to chinese or hk tastes so im curious how well this film will do with western audiences i heard its going to be released in the us in april 2002  but if you appreciate hk movies in the slightest you should enjoy this and even then ive heard good things from people who dont,comedy
this movie is very funny and even funnier if you are into its a great comedy with a fine score superb digital effects and lot of good slapstick elements very refreshing and far better than most big budget hollywood movies lately i normally recommend only one out of ten films and this is the one,comedy
hilarious spectacular and good sfx  a mustsee for comedy karate sports and action lovers  music is also perfect and the cast is just perfect the games are unbelievable if you can get your hands on a copy get it youll not be disappointed ,comedy
i had the chance to see while recuperating from a head cold during a vacation in singapore recently this is a marvelously funny movie a movie which pokes fun at two local obsessions and kung fumartial arts movies what if players had fantastic physical prowess such as that seen in crouching tiger hidden dragon could a ragtag team anchored by mr chow and his strange brothers and coached by a drunken former star overcome all odds and beat the evil team the answers to these questions is a truly funny movie which had me laughing all through the film very fresh original comedy which evinces an increasingly sophisticated special effects ability from the hong kong film industry if you are looking for a good laugh skip the hollywood crap with dumb twentysomethings drooling on themselves and catch this film a real treat,comedy
stephen do not disappoint me for this movie not only brings me lots of fun but also encourages me to chase my dream this movie is a little deferent with his previous movies cos the lots of computer stunts made the movie amazing in visual effectsand i think visual effects suit the plot wellwhich is out of my expectation that the movie will be absent of plotalso i find stephen is better in directing a movie from this moviei think stephen wants to tell us everyone should never say die to himself and keep on chasing a dream till it is accomplished it is a wonderful comedya fabulous actionmost of allits a encouraging one,comedy
this is the first time ive been driven to comment on a movie  i watched this film with a friend tonight not knowing what to expect  what i most certainly didnt expect was the funniest most inventive and downright entertaining movie i have seen since ever  every setpiece had me wondering exactly how they were going to outdo it only for the movie to constantly succeed to do just that  the effects are outstanding  the movie moves at such a pace that when it ended i would have sworn that it had been less than an hour long  the final 30min long football match is an object lesson in how to make the viewer go wide eyed with surprise while simultaneously laughing his or her lungs up  genius  sheer goddamned genius  10 out of 10,comedy
so funny  i laughed till i died great features on the dvd as well it has knocked shrek of the keep watching list thats how good this is,comedy
this was the funniest hong kongmovie i have ever seen it becomes even better if you know a bit of martial arts and as seen in the end shaolin bowling would be interesting too i can only recommend the dvd  be careful there are special stuff hidden in the movie,comedy
this movie although being a comedy was still fairly exciting the storyline wasnt the best a tad cheesy but the acting was solid and very credible all of the characters were adorable and the special effects really made you feel the intensity of their i loved it,comedy
minor spoilersit has been some time since i havent laughed so hard the coup de grace came during the last kick in the final match where the evil goalies clothes were ripped apart from the tornado pricelessthis is a pure gem of a movie it has everything absolutely stunning sequences ie seeing vicki zhao wei for the first time making her bread fantastic score great comedy and action sequences hollywood can only dream about and theres a freshness to it all something that is new and has never been done that makes the whole package irresistible well done stephen chowthe best movie of the year at least,comedy
most of the film of chow sing chi are funny and for it makes be laugh from the beginning to the end all audience laughed and clapped hands during that time i love the part when chow sing chi was singing with another man wong yut fei  i dont know whether i translate his name correctly or not but i think its a little bit exaggerated but anyway its an amazing film,comedy
one of the best comedies to emerge from hongkong in the recent past while other comedies from china often seem childish and silly this one captures all the qualities we love from fareast cinema it has great great action it has great great special fx think matrix go berserk it has a funny story which recaptures movies like major league now imagine this combined with all that shaolinhocuspocusmangastuff you got to love watching chinese movies and japanese animes if you like your action raw to the bone stay away from this one but if you want to see a movie that broadens your horizon in sense of humor and martialartsfx you gotta have to see this one the combination of and alone is worth a movie but proves that this interesting and funny concept works without any lackluster moments watch it and become a fan of asian action comedies 810 points,comedy
this movie is a must see for all stephen chow fans even if you are not a fan you will love this movie the storyline is good the acting is good and the special effects are awesome the special effects fits really well with the theme its not there just to be there it actually helps the movie this movie is the best movie ive seen this year i have shown it to alot of my friends and everytime i watch it i still find it funny everyone whos seen has liked it you will not be disappointed,comedy
for four years and since the first time i saw it my favourite film of all time has been seven samurai today having watched on dvd for the third time in two days i have now decided its even more of a perfect film perhaps than kurosawas epic masterpiece i have a friend who is a serious film fan yet whose favourite film is caddy shack is caddyshack meets the matrix meets crouching tiger hidden dragon meets all kindsa a stuff and is also one of the most totally original visually inventive entertainment movies of the past decade chow is at the height of his career as both actor and filmmaker and hong kong special effects have reached hollywood standard  yet they have much more ingenious things to do with it than most hollywood product especially comedys any fan of football or as you call itwill appreciate that this is the best depiction of perhaps any sport in the way its shot and coreographed chow manages to both send up action movie and martial arts cliches yet create as exciting a visual style as any martial arts action film some of the matrix style bullet cam photography some of the more inventive fantasy football elements and a finale that is narratively perfect emotionally moving and gutbustingly funny as welli have made it my mission to lend my copy of this film to everyone i know and tell as many people about it as possible i heard its been picked up by an american distribution chain so try and see it or even buy it if you see it in your local china town hiyyah,comedy
this kick ass movie is one of its kind or the first of its kind that ive seen i have waited for so many years for a movie such as thisit has all the elements it needs to be called anime in the flesh its got all the slapstick humor youd expect from an animeand all the triedandtrue formulas you would expect from a movie great movie period  vicki zhaos truly one of the most beautiful girl in this planet,comedy
this is my first stephen chow movie and i must say if hes not as funny in this as his other films than i must go see all of themi had read so many things about that i just had to see it for myself  i ordered the dvd and when i got it i watched it 3 times on that same day  i was surprised at how well made this film was  the special effects were topnotch and the acting was simply perfectif you own the dvd make sure watch the extended version for the 2 scenes that were deleted because they are 2 of the funniest scenes in the movie its not a thrillerhint hint but its a great comedy,comedy
i watched the vcd version 2 times i enjoyed it fully on the second time when i decided it is a comedy and treated it that way highly entertaining and i could not find any major flaw some minor ones exist it could be a big hit for teenagers who either play or english should be dubbed for wider distribution comedy is harder to sell for foreign films as a lot will be lost during the translation it is my first steven chows movie and i love it every moment it will not earn any film award but you will be entertained i like the training with eggs and of course all the matches based on nothing similar to compare i rate it a 95,comedy
is pure enjoyment from the opening theme music which is the same theme used in bruce lees way of the dragon to the final image the film continually charms hong kong superstar stephen chow has managed to continue his comedic style but has toned down his dialect humor in favor of a more straight forward approachthe comedy within the film is not high brow by any means however the film succeeds in winning the viewer over with its wonderfully enchanting special effects and the performances by the leads the entire cast turn in good performances the script and especially the direction push the film over the top this is simple one of the most enjoyable films ive seen this year with its message of striving towards ones goal and a belief outside of oneself this would make for an enjoyable family filmif you have the chance to see it do so you will not be disappointed,comedy
warning possible spoilers although not as funny as stephens older movies like fist of fury1991 legend of the dragon etc it does not stop me from having a good time with the animation effects and somewhat thin and farfetched storyline with a wide range of underdog characters the climax of the movie is of course the final match between the shaolin team and the evil team the match is somehow too exergerated with ball generating hurricanes and tearing peoples shirts off but it is refreshing and nice to watchrecommended 910,comedy
this is one of the most hyped movie in asia  however this movie falls flat on it face  the movie suffers a great deal from lack of a story line  no effort was given to develop any kind of plot nor development of characters instead this movie is full ot not so great special effect which viewer has grown acustom of  a movie should not be simply base only on special effect a story worth telling is what movie is all about  too bad none of it is present in this awful moviewhats even worse is that no one seems able to act in this movie  the actors were in majority of the movie acting zombies  exaggeration of facial expression does not equal excellent acting skills  overall this movie is by far one of the worst asian movie ever made,comedy
this is a nice movie with its up and downsides except for the premise of the movie the combination of and the storyline isnt too original there are also some minor plotholes and the special effects are at times overdone on the other side this movie has some very funny moments in it enough to make it worth seeing its not top of the bill comedy but it sometimes sure made me lough out loud the acting is pretty good and the direction is very dynamic 6510,comedy
i am not asking to be a prick i really want to know what kind of people rate this movie 7 and above i did laugh during this movie but that was in the beginning of the movie all that thing became boring really fast after the first match it was all the same all the time flying kicking flame ball blah blah blah maybe if i was drunk as a alcoholic skunk and 18 years old i would love it but i am not and i dont some of my friends told me it was hilarious but i suspect that they were lying or under influence when telling me it seems like i really really hate this movie but i dont i just dont like it i have seen far worse movies than this one and that is why i rate it 4,comedy
unbearable and thats me being nice about this film i didnt finish watching this film on the vcd you might say then its unfair im writing this review but after seeing an hour of complete nonhumour i feel i shouldi am a fan of good comedies slapstick etc give me mr bean theres something about mary american pie etc any time this film was as funny as sitting in a toilet bowl looking up at someone taking a dumpis a literal disaster movie the jokes for me werent humorous the slapstick badly timed and no story in the film at all except the usual bunch of nohopers wanting to make it big in footballi guess from reading the rave reviews from some people that this is something they enjoy maybe if youre not looking for much in a film but personally this really didnt do it for me thank goodness it wasnt my vcdone to take all the copies off the shelves of the local video store and throw in the trash,comedy
no racism involved in this remark folks honestly but can i please just make one pointer ok then asian people well maybe just asian comedies are simply not funny i have nothing against asians they have done some superb martial arts epics but their comedies are about as funny as being repeatedly kicked in the faceand this is no exception for just over an hour this is about as funny as being vomited on kicked dunked in horse manure and then sprayed with ice cold water bur even that might savour a chuckle but this far from in fact this is just a lame dubbed mess with utterly corny jokes and a shamefully ridiculously contrived ideathe idea isnt actually bad quite clever in fact but its done to such a poor effect it seems a burden and the jokes and supposed comedy dear oh dear this really isnt funny forget the praise this is a dull unfunny wholesomely corny satire that should be avoided strictlyfinal opinion  out of  1 out of 5,comedy
so here is a film that exists purely to promote football in foreign countries that dont embrace the sport and make it come across as quite cool when really its a bad advert for the game and a quite shocking display of egotistical knowhow on the directors behalf firstly its not  its football and the reasons for the use of the word boils down to the fact is the more globally recognised word and the fact it goes rather neatly with the word shaolin creating a cute little slice of alliterationlets think back shall we what particularly large event was about to happen in the world of football around about the time was released ah yes the fifa football world cup hosted in shock the far east with japan and south korea as the joint hosts who were making their debut in this prestigious event good lord wouldnt you know it  china the very nation from whence came good grief the film even opened in japan one day into the world cup itself what a shameless and pointless plug is turning out to be and the film hasnt even started yetso its an event film  so what i hear you ask well plenty actually while the actual scenes of football and being entwined and meshed together in this cgi fuelled orgy of creative movement and balance are reasonably fun to watch i take no real pleasure in laying into the rest of the film which is a pretty ordinary exercise in old fashioned romance the underdog working his way up and down and out individuals recognising their wrong belief or goal seeing as its football before turning their life around and winning through all fine and dandy but it doesnt nourish much in the long runstephen chow is one of the more accessible filmmakers from the far east in fact with hindsight hes probably the most accessible since a certain john woo chow brings his own flair and style to the above ideas but it is style and only style that he brings placing his characters in a grounded world of downandouts as they trudge from street to street collecting garbage and taking swigs from beer cans but everything is counter balanced by random outbursts of song dance and scenes during which characters kick objects into space and back down againwhat i dont like is stephen chow casting himself as this great visionary an all powerful character that has all the answers and eventually becomes the saviour of his team through great warriorlike abilities chow isnt prepared to lave a laugh at himself when it comes to directing and acting much like kevin smith does when he casts himself as a mute thus identifying the limited timesay directors should have infront of the camera rather than behind it another example is tarantino who casts himself as a fall guy or someone who eventually gets killed  a nearlyalmost role that supports rather than leadshere chow is some kind of master he and he identifies this himself in the film comes across the ingenious notion to combine football with martial arts something that no man in the history of shaolin or otherwise has ever thought of it is his goal to bring shaolin to the forefront of the rest of the world chow casts himself as this visionary perhaps a misunderstood genius and it just falls flat but it seems the film is immune from criticism because its supposed to be bad true the film is shot in a stylised and deliberately cheesy manner with crash zooms and dodgy special effects that i presume are supposed to look really bad but maybe were a budget constraint that coincidentally fell in their favour you never know but the referencing and deliberate daftness is something that only really stays fresh for a certain amount of timeat its very centre is supposed to be about the respect shown towards ancient beliefs and the consequent modernisation of these beliefs as we move into the 21st century in this case combining the relatively modern practise of football with ageold techniques as demonstrated with shaolin martial arts stephen chow plays sing whose nickname and consequent power is his mighty steel leg that can kick large dumpsters up into the air and onto piles of others after a bit of banter with fung man tat ng who used to have a golden leg he gets together a bits and bobs team made up of his brothers all of whom are down and out themselves but retain a forgotten power deep with their mindsthe team are predictably useless at first but suffer epiphanies in due course and it isnt long before theyre in a china based tournament with other teams their first match is a 60oddnil thrashing of the number one ranked team  i guess they mustve miraculously seen off team evil and the team made up of girls sporting moustaches in the previous season or something ah yes team evil the group of players run by hung yin tse who is responsible for fungs past tragedy in life when he payed him off for throwing a match and then broke his leg or something team evil are quite understandably evil and they wear a pitch black kit also they train underwater  when they kick a ball a miniature hbomb explosion goes off readying the audience for whatever explosive results might happen later on in a match but there are no explosive results to speak of just a grudge match between two teams led by chow on his ego trip and an off the field rivalry that goes way back its all very forgettable and i was thankful that it ended when it ended,comedy
is another odd movie weve watched recently and it was like some foreign food you try for the first time in your life you dont know what is it made of but the taste is awesome and keeps you wondering what the hell was thatto help you understand what i mean ill show you the ingredientstake 1 young master with an idee fixe to let the world know about the benefits of studying and using it in everyday life add 1 downonhisluck trainer who used to be a legendary player but ended up with broken leg and tarnished honor mix then add 5 shaolin monks iron head  an unlucky janitor at night club hooking leg  a grumpy dishwasher and excrement transporter iron shirt  nottoosuccessful businessman empty hand  unemployed guy who wears an infamous yellow suit of bruce lee and light weight  an obese grocery store clerk also add a team of local thugs finally add a baker of sweet buns  a girl with severe acne whose face is only attractive to flies get team shaolinthats not all the recipe also includesa tournament with a 1 million dollar prize  1 million dollar prize  a beauty salon run by a transvestite why why would anyone go there  transvestite beauty salon master a weird team of ugh modern amazon women  team evil and a big huge doping conspiracyif you havent figured this out  the movie is crazy its cracking funny and is full of special effects that might beat matrix plus some unique gags mix all the above things place them in the most unpredictable order add some unexpected encounters and the dish is ready serve immediately,comedy
you either accept this movie as it is or you dontthis is a very silly movie about a group of brothers who form a team and find self respect in doing so its basically a movie done as a filmas i said its very silly for example the villains team is called team evil the film is knowing and cute and sweet and funnyand i didnt care for itdont get me wrong i laughed and i smiled and i thought it was way too long and occasionally over done perhaps this plays better in the short version that miramax was going to release in the us which was to be about 20 minutes shorter then its original and apparently now restored running time to me its an hour long story not twowhat boggles my mind is that the film is going to get any sort of real release here granted the release date has been changed several times which has caused the director and star to be on tv shows promoting a film that was now months awaybut i cant help but wonder if someone really likes the film or if they think the combo of and is going to play well in peoria or at least to perorias help frankly its not that good and no better than any of several dozen comedies that hong kong film makers have produced over the yearsthen again i know this has been a big hit on the festival circuit and ive been reading about it for a while in articles by people who really like it so what the hell do i know if you like silly try itwho knows it may strike you as something wonderful as for me im simply going to remain puzzledno im going to watch bend it like beckham again,comedy
most movies dont have 10 of the ideas this one does i loved it i put this movie off for to long even though id seen hustle and became a fan of stephen chow way better than i could ever hope to imaginenow i watched the original chinese version so i cant compare it with the american version ive heard that the chinese version is the full version so i saw the right onethis is the kind of film that you cant take a breather from which is perfect the pace is frantic and enjoyable throughout the special effects are nice but overall could have been a bit better i cant complain thoughif your looking for goofy crazy whacked out zany moviemaking youve found it if you havent seen  see,comedy
i thought this movie was great at least for me it was exciting funny and well put together but if you want to see good things out of this movie you need to watch the chinese version it is so much better in the american version are are a ton of scenes cut out so if you want to be impressed watch the chinese one i found a lot of parts in this movie funny i find stephen chows movies brilliant i have also seen hustle which as a lot of returning stars in it from again another great show i think the funniest person was the land lady you may know but youre still a fairy lol i thought that was funny so watch both they are excellent,comedy
this movie will make you see in such a different way not a fan well whether you like or not this movie will crack you up this movie will hit you with a three hit combo of laughter in just seconds its so smart that they could put so many funny scenes in so little time and it will still make sense without ruining the movie this is what i mean when i say three hit combo first you start giggling then after take a deep breath another funny thing comes up and you start laughing then a punch line with a twist pops up and you just start cracking up with tears you cant hold your laugh on this one not only the comedy was good but the special effects was outstanding i wasnt even a fan of or the matrix movie and this movie still got me loving it with the realistic graphics the slapstick comedy and the strange but clever storyline i dont how you could not get interested in this movie,comedy
this is one of stephen chows funniest and most memorable movies to date and hopefully we will see much more of his works like this in the near futurethe comedic ideas in this movie is as original as you can get such as their attempt to sell shaolin martial arts through singing at a nightclub and being abused for itthe visual grphics can be sketchy at times but still visually mesmorising such as the final match with the cheating team taking drugs and developing skills to match that of the teamalthough many scenes were cut out in recent versions for those who can get their hands on the full and uncut version will enjoy this movie to its full extent,comedy
just amazing film this one should amuse people in every age group and every walk of life the action is not too violent for kids except maybe tots the love affair is unusual and convincing enough to draw in the romantic crowd the scenes are just spectacular visually and the story lends them enough weight to keep you interested the pace is very fast you never feel dragged down by this movie this film should have gotten wider distribution here in america  perhaps the fact that is not all that popular here had something to do with it this comedy pleased me more than just about any other movie  with the exception of pirates of the caribbean in the past few years i would recommend it to everyone i know,comedy
i waited 3 weeks trying to rent this movie and it was very much worth the wait absolutely entertaining the action combines wire fighting actual moves and cgi to make a very good movie it has just enough cheese factor to make it silly but doesnt go overboard thriller  just watch the movie p i havent laughed this much watching a movie in a long time there will always be people thatll point out the wire fighting and say it is no crouching tiger hidden dragon but so what if you are looking for a movie that will keep you interested with the perfect blend of comedy action and even a touch of romance just a little and no big name celebrities to muck up a good film this is the way to gospoiler the first scrimmage that turns into a war movie had me in tears hilarious,comedy
will become a cult classic 10 years from now for those who believe this movie is stupid and boring they do not understand the asian culture and how they perceive whats funny and entertaining in a movie is very entertaining very funny and a lot of fun to watch ill agree thats its not for everyone so i can understand some negative reviews but if your a martial arts fan and enjoy funny martial arts flicks like high risk my lucky stars series and several other comedy action films from jackie chan you will like this movie the story has been done many times before but probably not with this much flair golden leg is a superstar football player he is worshipped by fans of his country and looked up to by an understudy named hung in the championship game of the season golden leg has a free kick to win the championship but kicks the ball over the goal post fans rush the field in anger and start beating on golden leg two thugs come through the crowd with baseball bats and smash his golden leg he can never play again meantimea happy grinning hung walks into the stadium entrance way laughing at what has transpired flash forward some 20 years and you see that golden leg now works for hung he caters to hungs needs and is forced to be a foot stool as hung shines his shoes golden leg had did this very same thing to hung when he was the star this had occurred the same night he missed the fatal free kick  eventually golden leg meets sing a poor shaolin master who is adamant that shaolin can help you to be successful if you wish to learn he just cant figure out what to use it for to become a success he offers to teach golden leg but he refuses sing gives him a business card just in case he changes his mind eventually hung notices that sing has an incredible leg after his kicks a can into the sky as golden leg sees the potential of sings legs he asks him if shaolin would work well in a game of sing becomes overexcited about playing and asks golden leg to teach him and help form a team sing then goes looking for his shaolin brother to form a team from here sing meets mui who is a sweet bread maker and a master of tai chi using her tai chi skills she is able to make the best bread in the city even though mui has fallen hard for sing he just see her as a friend still mui has very talented hands even though she has burn and bruise scars on her face sing see her to be beautiful the love interest is a bit sappy and really goes no where which is good since the movie really isnt about romance at all eventually sing convinces his shaolin brothers to play on the team golden leg has always wanted to coach a team since he could no longer play even though hung had promised him he could coach one day for one of his teams he flat out refuses to let him coach so golden leg coaches sings team and has to go through a few other teams before hes able to play against hungs evil team who are the champs what makes this movie fun to watch is not only the funny dialogue but the incredible moves on the field also the stage singing with sing  iron head at the restaurant will have you cracking up its very funny the championship game between the shaolin brothers and evil team will keep you memorized till the final kick ive seen this movie about 4 times now and every time i watch it its enjoyable the movie is not stupid and its definitely not boring for people who say this these type of films are not for you they are for true japanesechinese martial arts fans who understand the culture and what the film director is trying to do there are films out there that are basically just for entertainment with little or no plot at all most of these films are the action variety an example would be the transporter if you went to see this movie for the script and acting then you went for the wrong reasons i went to see the action stunts and fighting period i enjoyed it because i watch the movie for what it was and not what critics want it to be thats the problem with movie critics they analyze a movie in 10 different areas and because 12 the areas arent oscar material the movie must stink if i was a paid  movie critics i could understand that but im not i go to movies to be entertain laugh cry be scared and have fun if a movie does that for me im happy does this for me its not more stupid then the simpson jackass or jay  silent bobis a must see for any martial arts fanatic who wants to be entertained other must see movies are drunken master ii tai chi master 1  2 fist of legend hero and all the once upon a time in china movies enjoy,comedy
this movie is so good the special effects are good the comedy is great and the message across is great it doesnt promote needless masskilling as some american movies have done so nor does it flood the audience with endless sex scenes and such after watching this movie one can get a sense of happiness a completion which is rare in movies nowadaysthis movie uses comical action and special effects to captivate the audience instead of with anabolicsteroidheros or scantily clad swimsuit models having sexgo watch the dvd now or see it in theaters when it comes outdrew,comedy
this movie is supergenius  its the feelgood story of a team  i doubt there are many other movies about teams  it has clever humor epic visuals and even a sweet love story thrown in  youll find yourself singing along with stephen chows song siu lam zen hooh yeah even if you dont speak cantonese  i sure didsee this movie before disney screws it all up like they did with drunken master,comedy
sometimes you just want a movie to get lost in no thinking just watching this was a sweet nothingness of a flick yep no real plot or twists or character development just great effects laughs and fun fun fun i give it a 10 out of 10 might not be everybodys cup of tea but it was mine,comedy
my all time favorite movie was crouching tiger hidden dragonthat was before i saw as a diehard hong kong cinema fan i have been wanting to see this film since its release because i like stephen chow and wanted to look at his idea of combining with shaolin and the film overall is a success you have comedy action sports a little romance stephen and vicky zhaoeven though its not seen much and all around fun you gotta love the dance sequence and the singingsiu lam ho yeah this is without a doubt my new all time favorite movie if you havent seen itget up and see it,comedy
although it is not his funniest film ive seen some of his film beforei still watch it for 10 times at the same dayall of the characters acted perfectly and the special effect is great i think is the best comedy in 2001,comedy
this is by far one of the funniest hk comedies ive ever seen this movie has great music special effects acting and gung fu i think this movie has something for any moviegoer if you love hk comedies youll for sure love this if youve never seen an hk comedy youll probably still have a great time perfect 1010,comedy
you know those movies that you watch that just make you smile for days when you think back on it  this is one of those movies  i was going to give it an 8 and point out its flaws but any movie that makes you laugh just thinking about it is an excellent movie in my book  stephen chow did a masterful job in combining the action of hk cinema that weve all grown to love while poking fun at its heroes at the same time  if you dont catch this in the theater the hk dvd version is definitely worth owning  this is the kind of movie that makes you love world cinema and makes you want to go out and create your own ingenious work  kudos to all involved,comedy
is a success of hong kong filmmaking industry until 29th of july it has a total gross of hk47700000 which tops hong kong boxoffice throughout the year of 2001 stars steven chow however never expect to be a farce every audience can see how serious steven chow is in although the plot is not a wonderful one the film is still entertaining audience are excited by the imaginative special effects and excellent performances of all the characters either shaolin and have never create a shock in cinemas of hong kong however a combination of the two great elements create an explosion in hong kong cinemas,comedy
im a fan of sports movies i loved bend it like beckham i saw trailers for on various other dvds and thought id see what it was like for the first time in my life i couldnt watch a movie to its completion ive had that experience once or twice with books but never before with a movie it is far too slow tedious and the characters have absolutely no appeal as characters it doesnt take much for me to enjoy a movie  ive enjoyed many that others have slated in the past but this had to be the most painful viewing experience of my life i watched at least 40 minutes of it it felt more like 2hours and the movie felt like it was going nowhere so id had enough i dont know if it improved in the 2nd hour but id already lost enough time i wouldnt get back,comedy
many will say it was wonderful because it was so over the top maybe so but i think it was just boring the jokes were so embarrassing that i did laugh by the way i watched in a sneak preview and otherwise i wouldnt have watched it but encouraged by some of my colleagues i joined them maybe im just taking this too serious writing even a comment on itmaybe the only problem was that i was sober during the moviebad jokes really bad acting not even amusing as a funny version of the matrix really bad ripoff waste of my timewatch it while your drunkstonedwhatever or dont watch it at all,comedy
im not entirely certain but it seems likely that this movie was sent to the us because the chinese wanted nothing further to do with itim assuming you can get over the wacky fictionalized martialarts physics because if you cant get over that you have no business watching this movie really the physics arent any crazier than in looney tunes so if that were the only weird thing about the movie id get over it howeverthe most interesting and original content in the movie consists of the lead characters monologues about the value of in everyday life and his discovery of someone who puts these principles into practice directly this is a fairly original concept or at least one that many westerners may not have seen previously and as such is the best thing the movie has going for itthe acting is spectacularly mediocre easily the best acting in the flick is done by zhao wei she and arguably stephen chow are the only actors with major roles here who deserve to get acting parts in any future movies none of the acting is really spectacularly bad like the sobaditshilarious acting in bmovie horror flicks but none of it is good either the writing in the english subtitles didnt help the situation much i hope its just poor translation and that the original chinese is rather betterthe characters are very twodimensional all of them even mui at least they arent all also static but their changes are sudden trite unconvincing and predictable even by american movie standardsthe special effects are the modern equivalent of the endless flashing lights in star trek the motion picture the movie has seemingly hours of special effects the same special effects over and over again theyre more advanced ie modern than the flashing lights of sttmp but they dont push any boundaries are not that impressive after about the third minute and are overdone in such a way as to draw much attention to themselves if the movie had quality in other respects the special effects would actively detract from itif i said anything about the plot id have to check the contains spoiler box if i even set out the beginning of the plot the reader would know the end there is no middle mighty ducks and the sequel and the other sequel had a similarly predictable end but at least it had some minor plot twists in the middle this movie has none zilch nada each sequence just goes badly and then they use the and suddenly everything is better sometimes everything goes badly even when they use the and then one of the characters uses a little more and suddenly everything is better sometimes the enemy uses more than the good guys and everything goes badly and then the good guys use more and everything is better it gives new meaning to the word lame come to think of it id better check the contains spoiler box as ive pretty much given away everything wouldnt want to be blacklisted for giving spoilers without warningsince i checked the spoiler box anyway theres one more comment which really is a spoiler probably the biggest surprise in the whole movie for any western audience will be that nobody kisses at the end those wacky chinese such innovation a movie with absolutely no sex come to think of it i didnt notice any objectionable language in the subtitles either so the movies not all bad in fact i would go so far as to call it a pretty good b moviehow it got billed as a major motion picture is another matter though no plot no character development crummy overdone special effects,comedy
most asian movies have terrible humour its the type of humour 37 year olds may find amusing so i was a little cautious about buying a fullon comedyit wasnt as bad as i was expecting chow is a good actor and carries the film and some scenes are very amusing the first goal was brilliant but it still has that asian humour thankfully not much which it could do withoutanother bad point was the last 20 minutes were rubbish it was like watching the intro on pro evo 2 without the queen music it was just computer effects which although looked fantastic were pointless,comedy
its almost hard to believe that this movie was made in 2001 and even harder to believe that it has quite a high imdb rating the graphics are absolutely atrocious its almost as if an amateur sitting at home with a computer could generate better graphics the worst part of it is that the whole movie relies on it completely the movie is based on china trying to promote as not just a martial art but a way of life but it hardly makes any sense it makes a mockery of the art and of i strongly discourage anyone from watching this movie for any reason whatsoever for even the entertainment value is low due to the poor graphics,comedy
this is the worst and most bizarre film ever some films are so bad they are good transporter 2 this is just beyond bad its a sports comedy with very poor sports scenes people kicking footballs  why and no comedy whatsoever i honestly didnt laugh once in fact the only good thing about is the tagline kick some grass which is quite clever that says it all reallywhat was stephen chow on when he made this he must have watched crouching tiger hidden dragon and escape to victory one after the other he had a thought  ill put them both together i really wished he hadnti just dont understand this film at all it is abysmal the storyline and characters are just plain weird how is this film entertaining the storyline is the usual predictable one used in all of the daft comedies produced by messrs stiller vaughn ferell and wilson guy overcomes difficulties and ends up with the girl with added football the only difference is that they are funny and stephen chow clearly isntthe worst everterrible acting the obvious storyline just plain terribleafter viewing this garbage with 3 other people we all said the same thing  what the hell have we just seen,comedy
ok ladies and gentlemen i am an honest reviewer i saw the first half of this movie and i was in complete outrage the script was very dumb the characters are completely stock and the character who kicked the ball like crazy was the worst idea i would ever think of the first game the team had was on a field with sand sand no team ever not even high school teams play on sand and why were there 5 on 5 it was always 11 vs 11 wasnt it and no coach in the whole history of would let a player who is overweight on the field only if he has no one else to put on the dialogues are stupid the teams suffering before they collect as a team is pathetic including the guy who likes to eat eggs and why are they doing karate on the field they would all be given yellow cards for fighting no human in the world can control a ball like that not even in any computer game again outrageous i am on the team right now and come to think of it there are more than 6 skills to and the third one was never dribbling the first 3 skills would more likely be running passing and controlling the ball my coach is emeka ezeugo who used to be a professional player and anyone who disagrees with me about the last 5 lines either has age of one digit or has no sense at all too much computer effects nonsense bad characters 1 out of 10 i gave it 05 that the characters were beaten up in the beginning and another 05 because they acted out their lines and movements perfectly,comedy
the joe cool review siu lam juk kau2001starring stephen chow as mighty steel leg sing man tat ng as golden leg fung zhao wei as mui and yin tse as team evil coach hungplot years ago golden leg fung was a renowned player he was paid off to botch a game winning shot and then had his leg broken years later he decides to get a team together to challenge team evil for the trophy meanwhile mighty steel leg sing wants to publicize in some way while also trying to reconcile with his brothers they finally come together using n to play can they win the trophy from team evilopeners i had heard good things about stephen chow mostly that his movies were funny i had never dreamed theyd be this funny was a big hit where it was originally created and over here as well chow went on to make hustle which was just as successful i think i know why his movies are really nothing of merit there is no real acting to speak of the plot is basic and without the comedy these would really be bad films but thats not the casethe good this movie is funny theres hardly ever a moment when something isnt happening to make you laugh its secret is its just slapstick theres just moments in here that are just silly for lack of a better word theres no real jokes to speak of but mostly visual gags and stupidity are the norm and it works the main lead played by chow plays his role very well and never over the top the rest are about the same the jokes keep coming and thats this movies strongest point however it does have another one its a visual marvel the effects are breathtaking which you wouldnt expect a movie like this to have effects but it does and they are very well done you would think also that with not being able to take any character too seriously you wouldnt care much for them but thats not the case they are warm characters and the lighthearted tone of the movie helps in that case as wellthe bad well like i mentioned before if this were a straightup film it would be a terrible one i know that it wasnt designed that way there are some cheesy oneliners and bad actingplot etc however i dont think chows intentions were to create a shakespearean masterpiece so one could let it slide in that department it could be said this movie is too goofy for its own good but thats just nitpickingthe ugly zhao weis bald head indeed makes her look like et and that just isnt right but otherwise nothing of note for this categoryfinal verdict is a very funny movie stephen chow does a great job with this movie and its very entertaining its one the whole family can enjoy as well i recommended itrating  of ,comedy
unfortunately by the time i got around to seeing stephen chows 2001 film most of the surprise had been spoiled for me and by surprise i mean the fact that this is a sleeper hit and cult favorite comparable to kung pow in its silliness but exponentially better in terms of film quality and humor tells the story of golden leg fung ng a star player who misses a goal at a championship game the crowd goes wild and proceeds to beat him up essentially crippling him for life hung a teammate who he has belittled in the past takes his place as the star and years later they end up working together only golden leg is now the whipping boy middle aged and a drunk he comes across a man named sing who extols the virtues of the shaolin when golden leg finds out that sing has a golden leg of his own he agrees to coach sing and his shaolin brothers in a team where they strive to beat hung who owns and coaches the best team in chinathe plot is extremely simple and there is no eloquence in the acting or dialogue but is a slapstick film with a brain there are some real groaner gags but i was never without the feeling that chow knew exactly what he was doing or saying in terms of direction and cinematography i was actually pretty impressed with the special effects and there was obviously a huge anime influence to some of the action scenes overall is an entertaining and enjoyable film its not something i would pull out and watch often but it is certainly making me look forward to the american release of hustle 610 shelly,comedy
there is nothing deep and revealing to talk about in regards to shoalin other than the fact that it took too damn long to get to the us granted the final product was cut short and seemed missing some elements within the film at least it still remained true to its original intent on providing a silly movie for the viewing public stephen chow may be considered a hit and miss kind of filmmaker but he caught on to something rather funny and intriguing with this hybrid film sure the dubbing is horrible but then again it makes the movie even funnier and doesnt detract from the final product however i did see this movie in chinese so hearing them speak was still quite a riot to behold i curse the fact that miramax seems to have no respect for asian cinema but they milked kill bill for all its worth and perhaps they should stick to releasing european style films and leave the asian film work to someone else,comedy
before watching this movie i was expecting more than i should that was a common mistake committed by lots of people believe too much on others comments its not a bad movie at all but it sure has some serious flaws this is clearly an oriental work made to their public and was probably a success in there to the average ocidental viewer however it might be a deceptionthe plot is about a poor guy that is also a master in shaolin and he wants to find a way to show to regular people how useful this martial art can be its a simple plot that dont have many twists or surprises which is ok the problem is that sometimes it gets boring to see some clearly useless scenes with no humor at all just to kill some timethe acting is fine although you see some actors does too many gags if you compare to the movies we are used to see the main actor which is also the director stephen chow does a great job with his character being himself the reason to many of the laughs in this movieone of the main problems is the special effects done in a very poor way reminding bmovies sometimes i dont know if this was on purpose to get the film to be more funny but i was very surprised with the bad quality of those effects in the trailer you get to see the best of them and you are tricked to believe they are on the level of the matrix or star wars well there are 2 or 3 nice scenes but the rest is just pure crapi might have been too hard on this comment but i intended to make my point clear if you are not familiar with hong kong movies be careful when watching this one or you might get seriously disappointed,comedy
if you enjoy and you will get a kick out of this moviethis film was cute funny and entertaining there was a lot of the slapstick humor typical of chinese movies though flatulence was mercifully omitted as well as typical effects i guess it could be said that this is a typical chinese movie with as the backdrop the script cinematography editing and sound were acceptable though the acting was goodheck if crouching tiger can get an oscar this should get a golden globe,comedy
why has this movie attained such a high overall score ok the movie must not be taken seriously and this is the way comedy is made in the far east  im aware of this and before you ask yes i watched the original version with subtitles not the dubbed onebut the movie is just plain bad even if you do not disregard these aspects  is anyone in the position to name five occasions whilst the movies running time which displays footballi seriously doubt it football should be played as a team the coach even mentions this when he tries to persuade sings brothers to join the team why for christs sake do we see maybe five passes played in all the football scenes together its always one striker against goalkeeper several players showing off their special move or just stupid violence and humiliation the average and cribbed special effects also get tiresome when you see them for  the 10th time the same camera movements got recycled over and over again as well the football is computer animated for about 90 of its screen presenceetc etc etcthis is not a comedy about its dragonball z  pokemon practizing something which should resemble if you enjoy watching crappy series like these youll love this superhero movieotherwise avoidthe few laughssmirks you get are not worth the pain you have to suffer whilst watching this crapfestthe bottom lineif the creators of this piece of film wanted to create clich rotten annyoing superhero sports comedy then they suceeded if they wanted to make this movie a sports genre persiflage by dint of the fascinating teamwork oriented sport called football they failed miserablyif you want to watch some better executed movies about football watch jimmy grimble or even when saturday comes   escape to victory 310,comedy
i am sorry but this movie is plain stupid i can see where the jokes should come but then it is hardly funny if funny at all the rest is cruel or dumbi seriously strained myself to keep watching this movie it was eventually somewhat worth it as the final cgi are truly nicewith that said i dont suggest you to watch the film it is just not worth it,comedy
the movie is marginally worth seeing if you are a fan of chinese films or the matrix if you are a fan you may be turned off by the lack of research into the sport or how it is played the movie relies on silly characters and ambitious but barely acceptable special effects the pacing of the film is quite poor suggesting that the filmmakers needed to pad the 89 minute film scenes unrelated to the action or story development tend to drag on does have its moments providing momentary flashes of clever writing and does introduce some interesting characters but overall misses the goal of combining an exciting sports movie with matrixlike action 610,comedy
going to see i had absolutely no expectations for this movie and that turned out to be true for 87 minutes i sat with a smile on my face viewing this time waster stephen chows didnt impress me nor did it make me disgusted the story by chow and tsang was a classic underdog sports story with a twistkarate i mean come on karate it may be original but the script just added on stupidity after stupidity the movie was pretty funny but not enough to get me roaring with laughter also though this might be because of the version i watched the brief love story seemed pretty weak though i am not a real good judge on foreign acting i would say the actors did a great job stephen chow and man tat ng really shone zhao and tse also performed well and of course hui li was fantastic slipping on a banana peel i wasnt impressed with the music by lowell lo and raymond wong there was nothing special with the cinematography by kwen and kwong overall a slightly funny but idiotic film,comedy

first of all i like this movie secondly here are points this movie was not released in roc 1 this movie must await certification in china for the film to be released but didnt hence banned 2 i dont know why this movie must endure the long wait of certification in china for this film to be released maybe since vicki zhao was not allowed in china then in which the country was forced to consider whether to release this movie or not 3 speaking of consideration this movie consists of buddhists in whether made fun of or not i dont knowi am not shallow but i have seen lately that china has dropped the ban on her for war reasons whatever it is drop the act china,comedy
it has been twenty years since a penalty miss in a big game saw the crowd attack golden leg fung and break his golden leg ending his career since that day he has worked as an assistant for team mate hung on the allconquering team evil  always with the aim of getting to coach his own team someday when hung refuses to let him rise above the level of a dogsbody fung gives up  after all it was hung that told him to miss that penalty in the first place depressed fung walks the streets where he meets young shaolin follower who shows him how can be applied to everyday life could it possible produce an advantage in football muses fung  hmmmmmmwith the internet buzz around this title a few years ago it looked like it would become one of those films that few get the chance to see but lots of students seem to list as their favourite film however a wide release for this film 3 or 4 years later meant that it wasnt just available to those who have the money for imports or those happy to download films illegally anyway in some respects this film is worthy of the internet heat because parts of it are enjoyably silly and fun to watch if you are used to the excesses of some martial arts films the football scenes are silly quite funny and entertaining for those reasons likewise some of the other scenes are quite amusing at points the problem with it is that it is that even at 90 minutes it feels like it is too long and has too little consistency to keep it going also once youve seen the same basic jokes made a couple of times they do tend to lose their impact  what looks outrageous in a 2 minute trailer soon gets old over 90the special effects are cheesy and silly but then i think that was the point and they do rather add to the humour the cast are ok but in fairness i only had access to a dubbed version so im not the best person to ask chow has a good charisma and he also works well with an amusing tat ng tse makes a good bad guy in a small role while the support cast pretty much do what is required of them although i didnt think a great deal of zhaooverall this is enjoyable on the basis of silly move and the sheer novelty value of the idea it starts to lose its impact a bit after a while as the same basic gag is repeated but the action is still fun i saw the 90 minute version and felt parts of it dragged thanks to the basic story being poor and the characters being really lacking so i cant imagine the full version being better but im sure all the hk snobs will vote me down for saying that silly and fun in parts weak in others but worth seeing for the funny football action,comedy
am i the only one in the world who thought what is this stupid movie and why am i sitting here watching it entirelythis movie makes no sense at all and is incredibly dumb no strike that dumb is too smart of a word for this moviego ahead and waste 90 minutes of your life you will wish you had it backif you are only that lucky watch fists of legend with jet li good martial arts and story line you really care about those characters this one is by far the worst excuse for any sort of martial artssports movies and i did see the original version as well better but not by much,comedy
dont listen to people who comment on movies they havent seen completely or who like the mr bean movie this movie is one of the best examples of martial arts choreography out there and ive seen many and samurai films its also very funny of course one who is not chinese may not understand much of the verbal humor it doesnt always translate well see it if you can find it,comedy
pretty good filmin the vain hollywood style good vs evilwould of suited for an earlier release and a tie in with the football world cup esp as it was held in  japan  south koreathis movie shows just what these nations can add to plain old european footballclassic good guy bad guy routines a sad love twist  great footballbruce lee effects thats if you like football  love twists for that mattercheck it out if you love football in the style with a bit of drunken master this should at least make you smile 8,comedy
combining a perfect eastern with a maximum style puma vehicle lots of beautiful to funny people and weird slapstick this fantasyeasterncomedy mingles the funniest and best of each class in a furious heap of nonsense great fantastic and worth watching it several times,comedy
if you like martial arts movies youll love  it makes fun of all the stereotypes and over the top stunts that youve seen in movies and applies them to playing  the amazing part is that through all of the slap stick and comedy they succeed in making you care for the main characters  unfortunately if you arent a movie fan especially chinese imports youll miss half the jokes,comedy
saw this last night on dvd been bombarded by the trailer at the multiplex all summer then found out it was already available on disc from asia all region dts the trailer is very misleading  it makes the film look like a wildandcrazy goofball comedy while the film does contain a lot of humor at its heart its more of a rockyin a brief prologue a star is brutally crippled by a rival during a match flash forward the former star is a lackey for his old enemy now a team owner when he spots a young man using remarkable kicking skills to beat back a gang he approaches him and convinces him to join in starting a new team based on shaolin principles the young man rounds up the friends he played with as a child  all of them now spectacularly unsuited for sports they train they bond they kick a ball so high into the air it takes hours to come down a love interest is introduced in the form of a poor breadmaker with a bad skin condition but a refined understanding of zen she will be instrumental in the films climax all builds to the obligatory big game against the old nemesis teamall in all betterthanaverage hk action with a nice dose of comedy to lighten things up the dvd looked very nice  better than most hk imports i own  and the dts track was solid though there wasnt a whole lot happening in the surrounds the subtitles though were atrocious  some passages made absolutely no sense it was as though the dialogue was translated by someone with only a phonetic understanding of englishcurious to see how this one turns out when its finally released here i read that miramax reedited it drastically then partially relented and restored some of it likewise they were planning to release it dubbed but now seem to be leaning toward putting out a cantonese version on the arthouse circuit in addition to the english wide release i can see why they are waffling about it  parts of the movie are very chinese in a cultural sense at times i had the feeling i was missing something the translation had something to do with it im sure but often i sensed that i was out of the loop as a nonchinese otherwise an enjoyable evening and recommended to even casual chopsocky fans,comedy
this film is so stupid that you cant not laugh while watching ive never seen such a stupid film even texan chainsaw massacre or braindead dont reach that level but this is an aware stupidity  i dont believe that anyone could make a scene of making bread using shaolin seriously and crossing with is the most stupid of all the players are former masters of shaolin kong fu  iron head golden leg empty hand etc etc  the most stupid you can imagine and the play itself is extremely brutal and cartoonlike have you ever seen 10 players getting into a goal together with the ball after a shot wounded after a half of match deadly serious keepers catching every shot well all of that you can see here if you remember this japanese cartoon kid series  its the same only in an actor filmthis film is so bad that it is good after all,comedy
this movie ruined my whole summer it turned every movie that came after it not as funny i should have protected myself but i unknowingly started laughing from the opening credits and from there on there was no stopping the delirious laughter that kept pouring out of my me shame on me for thinking chinese movies would never get a laugh out of me this movie is a secret weapon i never saw coming or some kind of surprise attack like perry landing in the tokyo bay area and ending 200 yrs of seclusion i felt like i got kicked in the back of the head and did it feel good long live ,comedy
funniest movie that i ever seen awesome effects like matrix you must see this movie i hope sequel will come soon,comedy

this is one of the most richly imaginative creative downright enjoyable movies ive ever seen i havent enjoyed myself this much since pulp fictionit took me a while to figure out who the hero was first i thought it was the barber guy who got himself constantly smacked about by the landlady i suppose its because he looked so dim he therefore had to be a kung fu master in disguise ive read some of the other posts and everyone seems to think the knife scene was the funniest i didnt expect to come to this movie for a laugh but the knife scene almost killed me luckily it was just me and my friend in the movie theatre so i could let it all outif you go to the movies to free your imagination then this is the movie for you stay away from people who say its farfetched and unrealistic if they want realism they should go to the laundromat,comedy
was one of the most visually imaginative and unique movies i have seen in quite some time upon first viewing the trailer i thought we would have another kung pow enter the fist on our hands but boy was i wrong unlike kung pow the jokes did not grow tired on me and the special effects were definitely top notch the scene with the two assassins playing that stringed instrument dont know the name of it in such a way that it kills was incrediblealthough there was not much to the story it was not nonexistent either there was a simple story happening which made sense for what we were watching even the jokes with the subtitles came across as funny and from my experience humor does not translate as easily as this movie would have you believe it borrowed or spoofed a bit from spiderman and the matrix as well which was a bit unexpected for this film initially at least for meto be honest i could enjoy this movie without sound or subtitles too it was that appealing to the eye it would be a good background movie for a party or poker game which could catch your eye at any moment and still hold your attention it could also be great if you feel like a good comedy i was entertained throughout and even though i was dead tired when i saw it in the theater it held my interest all the way to the end 910,comedy
goodness me what a fantastic movie caught the world premiere at the toronto international film festival and the entire theater laughed until they cried amazingly directed hilariously funny it blends a 1930s gangster stylishness into a hong kong kung fu movie to astonishing results who wouldve thought you could top shaolin soccer not me until i saw this movie stephen chow pulled it off chows comedic timing gets better and better with every movie he makes and while his films are depending more and more on cgi these days and makes this movie much more a fantasy kung fu film than a traditional one it hardly detracts from the enjoyable experience make it your mission to see this film  it will be one of the most entertaining you ever see i cant remember the last film i enjoyed myself in more my eyes still hurt from wiping away tears of laughter seriously,comedy
chaplin allen and now actor writer producer and director stephen chow can join the select few whose remarkable talent as a performer matches his ability behind the lens proves it chow is no stranger to direction in 1994 chow codirected love on delivery and since then a number of other self starring projects and many of these projects are considered the best of his acting career however his skills as a comedian  be it his brash physical comedy shaolin soccer his manical scenarios tricky brains or epic historical parodies a chinese oddsey  have never outshined his talents as a director not only reminds us of chows terrific comedic timing it introduces us to his stunning visual eye and exhilarating action direction more importantly this addition to chows superb filmography finally allows us a means of defining his technique a master of blending both comedy and visceral action with artistic integrity and traditional melodrama it has been awhile since a director has been able to take me from quite serious and intense graphic violence to over the top ridiculous spoofing the contrast of atmosphere and mood throughout the film is incredible and even more incredible is chows ability to make it all work when the scene is funny you appreciate the comedy when it switches gears to action you are blown away by the terrific sequences when it switches to melodrama you are on the edge of your seat awaiting character responses and when theyre all fused together you do exactly what chow is hoping youll do you laugh so i liked the film but what is the film exactly like most stephen chow films while the concept is simple to describe the execution is far more complex tells the story of sing a wannabe gangster attempting to join the famous axe gang who during some of the early scenes seem to spoof gangs of new york  look for a firework visual quote a legion of black suits responsible for a series of gruesome murders and complete dominance over a 1940s hong kong sings reasons for wanting to join the gang are simple bad guys are cooler his arrogance causes a war to break out between a poor housing complex that secretly holds a number hidden talents and the murderous axe gang what starts as a relatively small skirmish and i mean relatively explodes into a war of miikes dead or alive proportions the use of digital effects in this film are extreme chow having succumbed to the digital revolutions in shaolin soccer manages once again to use his effects wisely there are a terrific number of effects shots in this film far more then ive ever seen in a hong kong production save maybe the terrible wesleys mysterious file and while i am disappointed at the lack of practical effects the impressive quality of them more then makes up for it this film simply does not look like a hong kong film it rivals hollywood features in every category set costumes cinematography but amazingly enough the cgi is really good you can notice most of the effects but that doesnt matter because they are used for laughs and effectively so some of the effects not only will have you in stitches but also in shock and awe at the sheer incredibility of some of the scenes one scene that sticks out is a terrific spoof of the road runner its not hilarious but also a visual feastthe impressive action is thanks largely to the great choreography talent including both sammo hung and yuen wo ping each working on the film at spate occasions yuen wo ping manages to take a scene that appears to be rehash of the burly brawl hundreds of suits against one guy and manages to make it not only fresh but a thousand times more exciting and intense these fight sequences demand the attention of any cinephile who claims themselves a fan of marital art cinema wachowskis take not this is how you direct yuen wo ping to this artistic peak so everything seems great right this has to be chows best right actually not everything works and is not at all chows best film it is not his funniest film but that is because it takes the risk of exploring the action genre it also relies a bit too much on cgi and while its use is effective it can occasionally bring you out of the film compared to his other films this film ranks 1 for its visuals and action but in terms of laughs and writing it cannot surpass the classics that being said is absolute blast see it if you can at the toronto film festival import it on dvd and catch in theaters when sony classics brings it here in febuary i believe it is action comedy at its finestthree cheers for chow sing chi,comedy
after nearly two decades of avoiding kung fu movies a copy of this one was pressed into my hands by a very dear friend who then extracted a promise from me that id take the time that night to sit and watch it i was less than enthusiastic when i tossed it into the drive of my athlon but a promise is a promise after all five minutes later a nuclear strike warning in my town couldnt have torn me away from the screen and its been watched a dozen times sincetheres always been a certain cheesiness to hong kong cinema but on rare occasions a writer or director will directly tap a nerve and somehow weave that directly into the story is one of those films this piece isnt simply a standard kung fu movie its a romance a sweeping portrait of goodversusevil and a moral lesson on the use of power the comedic bits are so well integrated into the story that it flows smoothly from one tone to another the fight choreography is stellar and special care was taken to make sure that every character in the piece is human therere no perfect people or places and it somehow makes the wire fighting that appears in parts seem believable the acting is excellent and the camera work is all rock steadyfeeling jaded burdened wonder if its possible for one person to make a difference settle in with a copy of this film and believe,comedy
in my opinion this is the best chinese comedy kung fu movie yet to be made im not very familiar with the previous work of the director stephen chow except for shaolin soccer but this flick has everything to entertain any movie fanboth the humor and the drama made me weep like a small girl even thou im a guy almost at my 30s the impressive camera techniques and the story sure made this a phenomenal viewing experiencesorry jet li  jackie chan  none of the hollywood movies has ever touched me like this movie did i recommend this movie to be watched with friends in order to share the feeling of joy and laughter well be waiting for a sequel  dont let us down,comedy
before we went to see this movie we had heard about many good reviews of it after spending approximate 100mins in the movie theater we were extremely satisfied and entertained this movie is even better than we have expected there were full of laughters almost from the beginning to the end in the theater stephen chow displays his talent as both a director and an actor it maintains the previous chows style and humor as in other movies such as xi ju zhi wang and xing yun yi tiao long while those cgis were not expected in chows movie what the chinese people like is that it says no to super heroes it just tells the stories of ordinary people particularly those people leading insignificant and unsuccessful lives several characters in this movie were played by popular kungfu stars in the 1980s  1990s in china stephen chow shows respects to them as the way he respects bruce lee above all kungfu hustle is a movie with great hilarity stunning cgi effects fantastic kungfu and the lives of ordinary people i give it 9 out of 10 highly recommendednow this movie is in theaters in europe and north america the recent comments have shown a good sign alreadybest wishes to stephen chow hope western people like this movie as well,comedy
i saw this movie at the toronto filmfest and i have to say i loved it i really didnt know what to expect as i didnt know the director and had only really seen some pretty bad kung fu many years before there are many pop culture references in there like reservoir dogs and the matrix all done very tongue in cheekthe fight sequences are very well done and keep the movie moving at a frenetic pace the jokes tend to be visual in nature and as such side step the normal translation problemsall in all i thought this was a great movie and suspect this will be a huge hit ,comedy
in general its a movie which puts tribute to all the kung fu moviesome argue that stephen uses a lots of old jokes and routines in this movie that makes it a little bit weak on the script however i think its one of his best he doesnt make as many dirty jokes as usual but you can really learn his philosophy through this twohours movie and have a very good laugh at the same time if you really watch the movie carefully you will know what kungfu is stephen chow truly understands kungfu in my opinion and it a sure thing that he crazies about itits not a common kungfu movie like crouching tiger hidden dragon or hero stephen chow uses his own way to express kungfu i sincerely recommend this movie to those who still has the slightest hesitation whether you should watch this movie or notjust go you wont regret it,comedy
in the wildly imaginative and actionpacked petty thief sing stephen chow aspires to be a ruthless gangster stumbling across a gangcontrolled apartment to extort money from the locals who are actually kung fu masters in disguise sings actions attracts the notorious axe gang and set off a relentless chain of events that brings the clans together in an explosive battlefrom kung fu showdowns to dance sequences featuring tuxedoed mobsters youve never seen martial arts action this outrageous with jawdropping fight sequences by yeun wo ping famed action choreographer of kill bill vol1  2 and the matrix will blow you away chows movie is set in 1940s guangdong province china chow plays ahxing a street rascal who fools around constantly he is good at talking glibly but at the core he is feebleminded and stuck in poverty with an unknown future so it doesnt look good for axing at the beginning of the movieit doesnt get any better either a little later as we discover it is axings goal is to become a member of the notorious axe gang the fiercest cruelest and most widespread gang of the cityone day when axing goes into a slum pig cage town to do his usual extortion he witnesses a real clash between two gangs the axe gang is clearing out a local gang that has not shown allegiance to the axe axing realizes the slum residents  including the plump landlady and her skinny and wimpylooking husband  have each turned into kungfu masters to fight against the large group of gangsaxing then realizes this is a battle between good and evil and that he is called to choose one sidestephen chow continues his unique comedy style twisting the slapstick jokes and reinterpreting them with his composed face in chow intensifies the selftorture sequences and creates more funny points in his suffering for example when chow shows his characters practising kungfu while faced by a middleaged woman in the slum he is quickly kicked in the groin he is also stabbed by three flying daggers which were supposedly aimed at his enemy and is later bitten in the face by two poisonous snakes through all these trials he manages to survive for another dayapart from creativity has also demonstrated a higher quality comedy than his early 1990s works such as fight back to school 1991 and king of beggars 1992 the cinematography is more sophisticated with an authentic 1930s aura and like shaolin soccer heavily adopts computer graphics to present special effects such as the snake daggers and flying axes,comedy
i liked shaolin soccer it was full of laughs and stephen chow has done it again with its not in the same vein as shaolin soccer and it is not a belly full of laughs but it certainly emphasised his love of action movies especially martial art movies the film pays homage to all those hong kong martial arts serials bruce lee and the action genre in general i would even say that is a more refined shoalin soccer in terms of storyline action sequences and actingthe setting is great with some nice scenes of old hong kong and the way people used to live the fight scenes were pretty good especially at the start with the three masters fighting the axe gang okay the story was predictable but that didnt take away the enjoyment one bitoverall it is a highly recommended movie to watch and i cant wait for his next film,comedy
i saw this movie yesterday and it is definitely one of the best movies that was made in the history of hong kong the plot itself is simple and the storyline is all about kung fu yet it is not just a funny comedy about kung fu it is more than that somehow it is similar to harry potter in this case is wizard or animations by hayao miyazaki in which a world of imagination is created the characters in the film are so funny and classic most of them appeared in some of stephen chows movies before but because the context of every movie is different the overall result is hilarious this is a movie that make hong kong people proud i hope it will be a box office success in other countries too i think ill definitely buy the movie dvd for my personal collection,comedy
there is no score high enough for this except stephen chow is a kung fu directorwriterproducer genius mr chow does for movies what jimi hendrix did for guitars my guess is that all hollywood directors are saying you can do thatjust thought of thishollywood director you can do thatmr stephen chow you want to learnhollywood director bowing  yes masterafter this movie the history of movies will have 2 time periods premr chow and postmr chow20 out of 10zafoid,comedy
i dont know where to start with this movie my expectations were blown away in fact i wasnt sure what to expect but let me tell you that the experience was worth more than my disgustingly overpriced admission with the popcorn and drink on top of itperhaps ill start with the least important element of the movie firstly has officially replaced all other overblown martial arts films by a long shot the fighting in this movie is spectacular half the fights are so loaded with creativity it makes fighting movies look like something youve seen for the first time the cg is great the other half are part parodies of other films and they are hilarious as well as spectacular in fact i need to see this a second time because there are a ton of movie references in it i dont think ive caught yet depending on your library of watched films youll catch more of them i got quite a few and they were well doneand heres the most important part about this movie this is where succeeds where so many other martial arts movies fail it has a believable simple touching intertwined and well flowing story i cant tell you how many times where ive walked out of a martial arts  or even action  movie and been immensely disappointed because the fighting and explosions were great but the rest of it simply fell short these movies are typically way unbalancedbut stephen chow is talented enough to take both elements of the movie to their rightful place i dont know how he did it but it worked the acting is incredibly enjoyable the plot is likable the fighting will make your jaw drop and all the fighting actually has something to do with the story its absolutely amazingif youre tired of action movies not making the mark go see this one now 1010,comedy
this movie had me wondering much it was stupid and random yet it spoke to me in such a strange way it was incredibly mixed up and it worked very well its probably one of the most original pieces of movie art ive ever layed my eyes on though i was very optimistic in the first place i didnt really doubt it but i still didnt know what to expect what i got was a totally unpredictable drama comedy i also have to give credit to a chinese director making this great piece of work no offense to other chinese directors i have seen many varieties of great stuff from the orient but absolutely nothing like this great action completely original somewhat beautiful i give it  out of ,comedy
i gave this movie a 10 because i just thoroughly enjoyed this movie i wont go into details about the story because there are plenty of other comments that do that what i will say is that even though i read a couple of good reviews about this movie i wasnt prepared for what a wonderful experience sitting through this movie would give me while the plot was fairly simple and it was definitely an action film there were just so many things that surprised me throughout the movie there were times in the film where i had to applaud  it was such a feel good movie and i left the theater with the same huge smile on my face that was on my face for about 90 of the movieif you havent seen this film yet dont read anything else about it  just go so you can experience it for yourself without anybodys opinions coloring your judgment go and see this film its pure entertainment,comedy
being a complete sourpuss when it comes to most comedic film offerings from the last three decades though i attribute a lot of that to inanity rather than taking full credit for being a wet blanket i find that when there is a film that makes me laugh so hard that i am concerned about the possibility of a stroke i have no choice but to rave about it so having said that consider this a rave review of stephen chows kung fu hustlewhile the film itself was entertaining the prospect of summarizing the scattered plot is not set in 1940s shanghai basically centers on a tenement ruled over by a mean chainsmoking landlady qiu yuen and her whipped husband wah yuen when someone deigns to complain about the fact that they dont have enough water to take a quick shower she pounds them senseless with everyone standing by completely helpless flip to another part of town where the notorious axe gang a deadly bunch of dancing axe wielding guys are wreaking havoc on a city that cant even be protected by the police the two areas of town dont concern themselves with one another until a wannabe member of the axe gang sing stephen chow and his sidekick chi chung lam poses as a member in the tenement to extort money causing a series of events to occur in the tenement that wind up with most of the axe gang either killed or injured and brother sum kwok kuen chan the leader of the gang to do everything in his power to wreak revenge on both the tenement and its occupants particularly those who act as its safeguardsas i mentioned earlier there were a lot of parts that i found so funny that i was either finding myself almost lightheaded from laughing so hard or finding myself obnoxious because i would struggle to recoup in order to read the subtitles in time to not miss anything while there are several movie in jokes even one dedicated to chows prior film shaolin soccer it was the sight gags that really did it for me the chase between landlady and sing and especially the knife scene with sing and his sidekick were brilliant slapstick a lot of the action was extremely over the top and complimented by some pretty decent cgi workwhile anyone who has seen shaolin soccer knows that chow does not employ a normal cast of heroes it was still interesting to see that for the most part almost anyone who could have heroic qualities attributed to them did not fit the normal model as a matter of fact several of the major players in the film were middle aged or even elderly a notion that is both funny and refreshing for anyone who looks for something a little different in their heroes surprisingly there was also a very well conceived scene in the middle of the film involving two professional assassins who are trying to kill the main defenders of the tenement that i found to actually be a pretty kickass action sequence despite a couple of gags here and there until the end when the landlady got involved the scene was playing off like something i would say cooool in an awed tone about in a tarantino film or something so while the film was overall one of the funniest ive seen in recent memory there were a couple of great moments of highly stylized actionwasnt a perfect film by any means but the criticisms i have about it are completely nitpicky for instance the romance between sing and the mute girl was just kind of thrown in though some of it was necessary for background on his character and a purely aesthetic complaint i wanted more dancing by the axe gang chow shouldnt have teased us with the little bit that they danced and then abruptly take it away for the rest of the film hey its a review  ive got to air the good and the badbut since the good outweighs the bad exponentially i highly recommend to just about anyone because of both its action and comedic elements for making me laugh to the point of nearaneurysm gets a solid 810,comedy
move over jackie chan stephen chow is in town yes he is good and way more humorous than jackie i wish i was funny chan the truth is that jackie chan tries to look too adorable in his action flicks he never suffers the way the hero in kung fu shuffle did yes this movie delivered all the good on all cylinders i liked that mean dude who turned into a bull frog a lot that was intense and when he punched the dude in the face super hard and made his face go into the ground that was just plain sick also that lady with the hair curlers was awesome at first she seemed mean but then we learn different how did she become so powerful,comedy
a dream of a kid remember the bum who sell manuals if the story about sing really happens bum shall be some 20 years older than he first showed up when sing was a small kid but at the ending part he looks the same age with before trying to sell some more powerful kung fu manuals there may be other explanations but to read this part in a reallife way it means he is the one who is selling dream manuals and sing is just like normal people who just bought one and thenmade a dreammost importantly the changing age of adult sing and the deaf girl back to young kid at the ending part gave a huge hint that they still at their kid age throughout the movie the butt boy bucktooth jane tailor landlord etc showed in the end also implies that they are not legendary guys in the movie they are just normal people like u and me all the stories are a dream done by young sing he has evil minds indeed but he wishes to be a good guy he wishes greater power will happen to him so that can save at least his girlfriend and then if possible save the world this is a dream not only for him it is a dream for all movie fans and also a dream for people in normal lifewe go to theatres so we also have dreams this film is 10 out of 10 because it gives us many implications one of them is there are many ways to make a dream dont know how here is one,comedy
hi all i started watching kungfu hustle out of sheer boredom on my flight to japan i expected it to be another boring martial arts movie with clichd story lines and bad acting what i found was an amazingly entertaining crazy novel story with slapstick comedy that had me laughing my ss off loud stephen chow is definitely putting china on the world cinema map with his genre of movies the action is of course not real and has used computer effects  but i dont believe chow is trying impress everyone just by having real martial arts a la ongbak he is an entertainer like jackie chan was in his prime he even takes a cheeky punt at western movies like the matrix and spiderman which is pretty cool the story of kungfu hustle itself is set in a sort of 70s china and people like me who love travelling and different cultures get a real feel of being in china the story throws up a lot of crazy surprises like that of a childrens fairy tale and is very funny and refreshing i watched kungfu hustle a few times now and bought it on dvd and cant wait for his next movie kungfu hustle gets a well deserved 910,comedy
i have mostly good things to say about stephen chows latest moviefor the most part is unlike chows previous awardwinning actioncomedy shaolin soccer although he has obviously continued the martial arts theme and expanded massively his repertoire of sfxi am a chow fan beginning from the times when he relied on a deadpan expression toilet humour spoofs of other movies and books and goodending heartwarming smalltownvillage boymakesgood story linessome of those elements are noticeably absent in kfh ng man tat is missing as is the customary female attraction the main female character has little screen time the cast of ss is back excepting ng and the goalkeeper of that movie in particular has a roaring time here as the leader of axe gangbut of course when it comes to kfh one must talk about the sfx in themselves they are creativelydone and quite out of the world as part of the film one might ask has chow stumbled into the cinematic abyss that has caught so many of hollywoods directors who dabble in the black arts of sfx thankfully the answer is no true kfh unlike ss is weak on story and characters which has been characteristic of recent western yawns such as van helsing blade trinity etc in this chow has stepped away from the formula which made ss not just a sfx extravaganza but a successful story in contrast kfh is a bundle of action sequences thrown together to showcase the sfxbut the wit and cheekiness of chow remains it is gratifying that the fun and sarcasm that has been a hallmark of his acting career have translated themselves well into films that he has produced and directedso in kfh we have chow spoofing the clichs of chinese martial arts stories the retired martial arts couple who become petty scrooge and lecher the heroes who save the neighbourhood one of them gay end up getting dispatched soon after and the con beggar who sells a wu ling mi ji to a naive boybecause of the spoofs the sfx dont become spectacles in themselves but help to drive the madness upward highlyskilled sitar players strum out blades and ghouls in battle a pugilist using the toads skill croaks and blows out his lower mouth like one chow ascends into the skies as he masters the buddhas palm with a eagle in the distance the engrossing mass battle with the blackclad axe gangsters lifted from the matrix movies it is all mad irreverent and at times even affectingstill i do yearn for the good o chow the sfx are fun and crazy but surely the funniest bit in the film has got to be the knifethrowing sequence that is good o chow so i dont mind just bring on the chow be it old or new in the next year,comedy
this movie is a highly creative and stylized action film from the hong kong kung fu genrea lot of wit slapstick visual effects killer kung fu and a unique plot offer an incredibly fun and entertaining film wonderful acting and directing has elevated this film to a level on par with with other unique and innovative films like crouching tiger or the matrixat one time i hated all kung fu movies like most i could only tolerate bruce lee and couldnt understand goofy hk kung fu cinema thanks to films like this i now look forward to edgy modern kung fu movies two thumbs up,comedy
i did not know what to expect of this movie other than what the trailer showed but i was completely blown away by this film not only does it pay homage to the matrix and spiderman as well as looney tune cartoons but the opening with the butterfly paid homage to the men in black with the dragonfly flying through the opening credits from that point on i was totally swept up in the movie and the 95 or so minutes seemed to go by in no time at all the effects were well within the atmosphere presented by this actioncomedy and i found myself laughing at all the jokes presented as well as feeling for the character of sing as he blundered his way through trying to be a gangster even though he was way in over his headscene after scene flowed with maybe some exceptions here and there but all in all held together and kept my attention i too could have watched this movie without the subtitles and have enjoyed it just as much the tonal sounds of brother sum the language itself added to the beauty of this film i could close my eyes and listen to it and be swept away if the language was not so hard to master at such a point this far in my life i would love to be able to learn it just to get the true dialogue they were speakingfrom the background story of sing to the rag tag collection of people living in pig sty alley to the seemingly inept but fear in sheer numbers of the axe gang this film has enough characters to satisfy anyone they each have a place in the movie and i dont think it would be the same without themthe story cinematography the effectsat times obviously cg but they fit within the context of the film the characters and even the music all make this a memorable viewing enough to put this in my collection of films that i could watch over and over without growing tired of itthere is so much i actually enjoyed of this film i would love to dig deeper into the career of stephen chow i had not heard of him before this viewing but i would like to see if his other films were as entertainingif you like movies that have martial arts enough action and comedy to spare with a story strong enough to hold it all together i would recommend you catch this movie i cant wait for it to come out on dvd,comedy
this movie has everythingcomedy drama pathos incredible action slapstick great acting a great story wildly inventive absurdity actual thematic threads a long gone element in us films moments of sheer poetry and genuine heart in true hk style it has a bit of everything not only was it a much much better martial arts film than either the more respected hero or house of flying daggers it was a much better film period in fact was one of the best movies of any kind ive seen this yearits great that columbia picturessony classics gave this movie a us release with only minor cuts which now that ive seen the uncut hk version should have been left in but it is obvious that they had no idea how to market it though they spent a lot of money trying they pushed it only for its comedic elements positioning it in the media as a wacky spoof of kung fu movies like blazing saddles was for westernswhich it is notbut i dont really blame columbia for kung fu hustles weak stateside box officei blame those morons at miramax yeah you heard me you two i think that this great movie would have found a much bigger audience if miramax the us distributor of chows previous film shaolin soccer hadnt so utterly botched that films us release showing it heavily cut in only a couple of theatres before dumping it unceremoniously onto video while not all americans are familiar with the conventions of the hk kung fu flicks of the seventies which admittedly does help when viewing everyone in the us knows soccer i think soccer could have been a us smash along the lines of crouching tiger if handled properlyin a perfect world the more easily digestible shaolin soccer would have been chows huge us hit paving the way in the american public imagination for this far superior follow up if chow had become the us star he should have a couple of years ago americans would have lined up for hustle even if they had never seen a kung fu movie in their lives but it was not to be people didnt know who chow was and couldnt tell what kind of film was being marketed they went into the theatres expecting to see a dumbass gross out parody and left disappointedits just not right that more folks in the us havent seen this great film lets hope for a second life in the usa from good dvd salespsand by the way i dont think is really doing parodies of either the matrix or reservoir dogs as is way too often mentioned in reviews both of those flicks borrowed heavily from previous hong kong movies so i think it much more likely that chow was referencing the original hong kong movies with which he and other asians would be most familiar not the american imitators,comedy
my friendly neighbourhood video store manager recommended this film to me and so i rented it since hes never steered me wrong before the packaging claims the film has a tarantinolike quality to it but what decided it for me was that i recognized the choreographer the same man who choreographed crouching tiger hidden dragon woo ping yuen and to my surprise i thoroughly enjoyed this movie it did have a tarantinolike edge to it it also had a touch of the matrix and a pinch of the romance in braveheart and the magical quality we saw in crouching tiger this movie had me bellylaughing it was so funny a selfparody it mixes fantasy comedy and great action sequences very well and has a magical quality as i said that i really appreciated i found it unconventional touching and absolutely hilarious subtitled in english these movies have come a long long way from the chopsake films i used to take in in the seventies in chinese theatres where the subtitling was unintentionally hilarious kungfu hustle wasnt a onenote film it covered a number of territories and covered them surprisingly well if youve never seen a chinese action film before and are used to jackie chan films you may not know what to make of this film but i can almost guarantee that it will make you laugh out loud great cast with uniquely drawn characters great unstereotyped hero sweet heroine flying martial arts shakespearean aside characters fantasy terrific comedy and an abrupt ending i found myself wishing for more all in all completely enjoyable,comedy
gong fu is one of the best movies i have ever seen it is by far the best kung fu movie i have ever seen it is right up there with once upon a time in china first the action the movie starts off slow but gradually picks up the pace with some of the best action sequences ever seen in a movie of its kind other kung fu movies have longer action sequences but it doesnt matter the action sequences are so fun that it makes up for the shortness of the fights i will say though the special effects in this movie almost crossed the line for being mistaken for a cartoonbut im not complaining the acting in the movie is also goodthe best actors in the movie have to be the beast the landlady and stephen chows character finally event that made chows character so powerful at the end of the story was predictable but i loved this movie is so good i am going to see it again a,comedy
stephen chows done it again hes made an entertaining and violently amusing bruce leeinspired kung fu flickthankfully spared from dubbed motion picture hell this received the proper subbing job and it really doesnt affect the story or humor in any way the sight gags are fairly good and the conversations are quite comicalbut this films shinning quality is the violence its quite gory it times but never disturbing not matter how absurd the death is its always funnyplus brother sum has to be the greatest character in motion picture historybruce lee fans will especially recognize references to his films and if you thought kill bill was a marvelous gorecomedy youll dig this 10 blargs out of 10,comedy
this one is a great one that was what i was told by the young lady when i bought the ticket at the window this one is the funniestexcellent and greatest comedy and gongfu movie that i watched in recent years that was what i thought when i walked out of the theater the movie contains wild imagination hilarious story and coolest actions but those are not all about it it also brings sweet love kindness honest and justice i like the music which is quite different from the hero and story in this one seems more meaningful and reasonable than the hero too it is better than kill bill to me i dont like the bloody scene in the kill bill which is neither funny nor cool but in the kong fu hustle there are cool actions not that bloody but more entertaining i think stephen chow is a talented actor and great director he really made a great movie this time i would like to see more of his production all in all this movie is highly recommended and you will be regretted if you miss it,comedy
given the choice between shaolin soccer or kung fu which one i preferi think i will choose kung funot only its cgi is 5 times better than shaolin soccerbut also it affects my feelings about chows past movies  although it is said that he plays a role who appears half of the timei think it doesnt diminish the importance of his role because why did he change his mind to hit the top worlds killerfireclouded devilwith a stickand why did he stop fighting to that crazy guy until he played buddha palm the key is that sing is not really bad and sing in the play always said i am not a good mani want to blahblahbut if someone were a bad guy how can he or she say i want to kill a personand i wanna be a bad person because bad guys kill people without reasons instead of hesitating about that so he can hit top worlds killer right nowhoweversing was struggling with right and wrong as if he was on the edge of darknessand stood on the steel bar where he waited for someone give him a push who did push him at this moment yes what you think is that girlshe told him with sign language hey did you forgetyou saved me in the past butstephen chow told the reporter that mute girls lines should be  hey did you forgetyou are a good personwhy you robbed me  thussing were facing the dilemma of being a good person or a bad guy finallysing said to himself and realised that he is a good man this is why he was for the landlady and landlordlikewiseafter he got hurt badlythe landlady asked him how come you became righteoushave you got something to say thensing drew a stick of candy with his blood in factit shows that he is a good man withinand is ready to do what he has to do and what he is prepared to doit is similar to following his instincts like 6 guys in shaolin soccer who had found their roles after they got punched in the match to sum upevery time i see kung fu i have a different feeling it is worthwhile to pay money to see it again and again stephen chow not only earns our moneybut also makes everyone laugh and cry,comedy
as a film worker in hongkong it is not surprising at all that one day chow summoned up spirit to make a kungfu movie not to mention chow is a big fan of bruce lee and kungfu movies he has been dreaming about fancy combat scenes since he was a kid when he eventually gained enough power in this industry he set out to produce a kungfu movie to visualize all his imaginary fight sequences long haunting in his mindto do this chow needed real kungfu experts he fulfilled a long time wish of finding a martial monk yu xing from shaolinsi temple who played coolie and delivered the top kicks in the movie he wanted a master of cudgel sammo hung recommended zhi hua dong who had been practising beijing opera since 10 years old and majored in martial art at college dongs presence of donut in this movie secured the most exquisite fights chi ling chiu tailor is disciples disciple of wong fei hung a master of hong fist these three masters delivered the most breathtaking scenes indeed the first fighting sequence in the movie tops simply because what they played is solid kungfu check out the sober and elegant stances by donut and the swift and fierce kicks by coolie i like the second fight against the musicians too especially when coolie is killed the leaves are cut off the basin is beat over the cat is sliced up  these help to visualize the precise ambiance and illustration as chi is applied through music to attacking there is not much about real kungfu but chow made a brilliant job to put on screen what kungfu fans had only been able to imagine about scenes like masters fighting against each other using music or howl the cudgel performance from virtuosi dong climaxes the act and matches perfectly the atmosphere elaborated by cgi and music but i dont like the idea of hordes of skeletons delivered by the musician it should be like invisible but powerful chi flow through music which can punch on and cut into objects in distance the lions roar is also well executed in the fight against the musicians i particularly like that rain drops were suspended by the chi flow surging in air this kind of details show how fresh and vivid chows imagination ischow also invited siulung leung to play the bad guy chow was a big fan of leung who once was the most successful substitute for bruce lee but leung didnt get much chance in this movie to show off his kicks as chow relied heavily on cgi in leungs fighting sequences its a dilemma how can you depict a master who is supposed to be much superior to the real masters as dong xing and chiu chows answer is to using cgi to make the beasts moves quick the result is that all the moves turned out to be simple sway and punch it is animation not kungfu though some may say the effect is not bad as a kungfu movie kfh is a compellent try but chows fans are never satisfied if he does not provide a comedy with a quality as from beijing with love or an epic as the chinese odyssey in many fans opinion kfh lacks for many things here after all its not an easy task to make a comedy to exceed the works during his hay day a typical chows movie is usually an extremely selfindulgent one wholly relying on slapstick and nothing else but he wanted more this time he offered other actors much time because he is wise to know that he need kungfu experts to fight in the movie not himself he decided to put kungfu acting and settings in the first place and constrain his gushing waggery a bit the jokes are not original and fierce as usual if you have watched half of chows movies though they are still effective at some points as they are well executedthe great pity is that he left man tat wu out of this movie after being amused by the highly successful pair in most of chows movies we end up with a movie which chow put in all his physical energy and intelligence without man tat wu there are rumours that they have split up because of chows demanding attitude in work the loss is obvious for chi chung lam as the fat sidekick is incompetent at this position which wu used to be at his dull facial expression and pale voice make his part totally insipid there is no chemistry at all between lam and chowthe surprising contribution is from kwokkwan chan who was as incompetent as lam in shaolin soccer but he did the job with skill and ease here its like his chi flow was channelled and he became the one all of sudden his role as the cruel and arrogant gang boss is a brilliant try he prevented it from being a conventional bad buy by playing his voice and body language in an exaggerated way it was very effective for he must be a natural born dance genius but i still confused how he could play his voice so well here while he struggled a lot and made more than 20 ngs for the first lines in shaolin socceri have to applaud the art departments work the image of the apartment complex may be based on chows early life and previous movies like qishier jia fangke it is the most interesting place in the movie providing a wonderful stage to weave intriguing stories and hold interesting characters the idea that some kungfu masters live anonymously in a slum is engaging itself for it is a fancy wish for kungfu fans that some masters are actually living amongst the public not in far mountains and remote temples,comedy
stephen chow has to be one of the funniest men alive i have never seen him in movies before and he was really funny as the small time thief sing when the deadly axe gang captures him and his sidekick after they pretend to be axe gang members he uses his lock picking talent the axe gang leader says if they can kill somebody they will become members of the gangsoon sing and his sidekick split up and sing goes on and finds out he is the one the martial artist chosen to be the best ever and to stop the gang violence meanwhile at a small housing development three martial arts masters fight the axe gang members and are soon killed by assassins then the landlord and his wife go on to eliminate the axe gang but are wounded and sing must defeat the worlds best martial artist and the axe gangthe fight sequences are awesome and the movie is hilariously funny i advise you to get out to the video store and rent this now,comedy
stephen chow has problems hes one of asias biggest stars but he has subject matters that seem too flimsy for his versatile personality so whats the solution make them edgy or garnish his ideas with deep and troubled characters which can sometimes be negative what he does is add zang and plenty of people getting seven shades of asia beaten out of them in his latest offering  kung fu hustlethe man who brought you shaolin soccer the kung fu versus premiership rumble is back with a film that blends immiscible themes akin to an oilwaterfire combo but there is talent here something reminiscent of the coen brothers in their complexity and setting up camp in leftfieldthe multitalented chow directs and he does that well he writes and he does that well as the lead sing he does that very well as he morphs into a comedian that can and will split your sides and im not just talking about laughter set in prerevolution china is a brutal take on gang warfare within a seemingly peaceful community despite matrixesquire choreography and special effects the film remains serene in a childlike way chow clearly had fun writing and performing in what is essentially a comedywe witness a turf war erupt between the axe gang and the residents of pig sty alley neither of which are clever names as the axe gang begin by chopping and scalping and the residents rise from their squalor and use their combat aptitudes to complete the david and goliath analogy sing and his overweight bumbling sidekick are caught in the middle as he pretends to be a member of the axe gang and helps the feud escalatein all succeeds because it does what it says on the tin it is a well envisaged roller coaster of a movie that has nave comedic value and almost lends the film innocence this is blended surprisingly well without glitches as comedy turns to brutal violence in some amazing set pieces that see people hacked kicked slapped and musically destroyed in one of the closing scenes youll see what i meanthe characters are well thought out and lend their own comedy and fighting skills to the setup note the chain smoking landlady and the song and dance routines that on the surface seem ludicrous but add bonus comedy value as you know someone is about to have their teeth cut out or met with the hand of god a brilliant scene that ends the filmanother worthy attempt by mr chow creating 95 minutes of well thought and fought out thoughtless action phew,comedy
when watching stephen chows movies one must not take them too seriously my father watched last year and his comments were merely two words  too exaggeratedto me it is a great movie in almost all aspects comedy melodrama and actionthe humour in this movie are very creative funny and presented in the right timing i laughed so hard that i almost couldnt breathe the fight sequences are very welldone the visual effects are surprisingly good for a hong kong movie last but not least the soundtrack is wonderfully pleasant to listen to it contains scores that reminds you of 70s kung fu flicks as well as scores that are really touching they played in my mind even after a few weeks after the moviego watch this movie you wont regret,comedy
kung fu is a hilarious dark comedy with lots of slapstick and spoofy moments director and actor chows intention was to make the audience laugh and he does succeed however i think the film could have been better had the screenplay been stronger as there is no coherency or even a proper plot while the comedy is very good some of the serious moments seem outofplace and the final action sequence looks very overdone while many fight sequences have been impressively shot some look artificial due to overuse of special effects and slow motion yet that might have been done to create a spoofy feeling were presented with lots of genuine comic scenes and i liked how chow used many classic films as reference source eg the shining casino etcin terms of performances kung fu belongs to the qiu yuen wah yuen and stephen chow the three form a hilarious action team while it would have been more interesting to see how chows character develops as the change in the end seems too abrupt the actor does very well as a wannabe gangster much of the supporting cast add to the humourkung fu is a flawed comedy as there are moments that dont seem funny as they dont seem to fit in the black comedy genre either it also relies a bit too much on computer graphics which as explained above makes some scenes look less realistic yet its a funny action dark comedy that provides several opportunities to laugh,comedy
this movie shows just how far chinese films have come it is very funny and will have you laughing all the way through unlike most chinese films the storyline is good and will have you gripped right the way through to the end and there are moments in this film when you will just have to laugh out loud stephen chow has created a masterpiece which will live on in the memory of most if not all of those people who have seen it if your in to chinese films then you should recognise quite a few actors in the film and if your in to your love stories then theres an element of that particular genre in the film as well the effects in the film are brilliant and it would be hard for anyone to find faults with the effects usedcant wait for more releases like this in the future,comedy
is kill bill with a healthy dose of looney tunes thrown in for good measure its a rip off of about a hundred other films but yet it never feels like a rip off to stephen chows credit it feels totally original and you find yourself as youre watching the movie eagerly waiting for the next bit of insane craziness hes going to throw on to the screenthis movie pokes fun at the earnestness of recent films in the genre like crouching tiger hidden dragon hero and house of flying daggers nothing is taken seriously here and thank god for that this is one bit of nonsense after another and its enormously entertaining film buffs should have a blast ticking off the homages to other films the axe gang brings to mind the crazy 88s of kill bill chow tips his hat to the bloodspurting elevator scene from the shining a poster for top hat is prominently displayed in the background of one scene suggesting that chow draws inspiration for his dazzling fight choreography from the fancy footwork of fred and ginger and the matrix gets its due as wellchow gives himself a fun character to play and hes also written a very clever screenplay pay careful attention to the early scenes because clues that you might be tempted to shrug off as just being silly bits of embellishment actually become quite important later onand lastly this movie has an awesome soundtrackgrade a,comedy
this film received low coverage when first shown in sydney australia and what a shame that was because it beats kill bill and crouching tiger hidden chickens hands down to even compare it to those two does not do it justice the people who made this film were awake because of the action and good sound this is best seen on the big screen but if you cant see it on the big screen just make sure you see it  good music good humour big characters good choreography plenty of surprises and a story set at a fun pacethe people who made this used many of their own ideas not something you see that often these days in mainstream cinema and that is why i found this so refreshing i hear that stephen chows other film shaolin soccer is very good if you can find the uncut version,comedy
this is one of the better movies of 2005 and its not even in english i though the framing of jokes in this movie were top notchthe movie takes you on a journey of street gang called the axes who have established their domiance in society they even dance after they kill someone that is so coolthe movie takes a lot of risks and use a lot of expected comedy in a whole new way this movie is really good i laughed the whole way through you forget about the subtitles after about 5 minutes there is so much nonverbal acting that you dont even need the subtitles at point to understand what they are sayingsteven chow is well on his way to being the next big thing in america he is already big in asia look out america this is a fresh new addition to our cinema goers,comedy
wow this movie really made my day its very rare that i can say that about a movie but today i left the theater with a smile on my face thinking that was money well spent movies are normally 1820 usd here in japan but the first of the month is 12 price making that normal price for me as a former new yorker this movie is really something special and i wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who likes kungfu slapstick action and everything in between its got characters you can love unrelenting action sequences an appropriate amount of weirdness great cgi heartwarming moments even a tiny romance element the fight choreography is done by none other than the masters yuen wo ping and sammo hung together its a fun lighthearted actioncomedy thats got something for everyone if youve seen shaolin soccer or earlier films like god of cookery you may have scratched your head at the bizarre references in chows movies if youre not chinese or dont understand cantonese you probably wont get many of the jokes no matter how hard the translators try you wont find that in kfh the story here has been much more sanitized for a larger nonchinese audience chow eschewed a lot of the quirkiness and culturallyspecific jokes in favor of a movie that is more accessible to a wider audience using more universal themes visual gags and a whole lotta arsebeatings shaolin soccer really blew the doors off hk actioncomedy cinema when it came out but i dont think chow had any idea it would become so big outside of hk it had a cult following in japan and the us and was big here for a little while but many people just didnt get it due to the many cultural jokes none of that in kfh chow just concentrated on giving everyone a good time the 40ish japanese man sitting next to me in the theatre laughed as much as i did throughout the movie and i grew up speaking cantonese of course its stupid its unbelievable its a little weird but its fun got great action great cg even a few sad moments i loved the heroes especially the old couple go watch it for yourself if you hate it then someones gotta check to make sure you still have a sense of humor,comedy
this film is maybe not a laughy like chows works agobut we have no any doubt of its excellent quality there are so much powerful expressive force of vision mind in this movie it takes us not only moving or laughingbut also a deeply touch about great development of chinese movie business this is a normal mans dream of super gongfu hero its a real heros story in truelifewe are personally on the scene of movie worldyou can feel the happiness or the sadness of chow hits friend i think you have enough reason to pay your new years holiday in the cinema to watch the gongfu movie with a big barrel of popcorn  cola,comedy

you can read from others about the basic nature of this and how widely it is admired and enjoyed i myself admire and enjoy itits a movie about movies its something between a scary movie style parody and a charlies angels  whats called an homage but is really more of an annotation at a distance with a tinge of mystery science thrown inwhats here is all the stuff youd see in serious movies assembled and recreated with a quirky space between it and its references there are some actual jokes in the thing but the big joke is the that it does what all the serious kung fu movies do but with a wink i believe jackie chan invented the mode but i think i like this sort of excess better ill take one of these over a matrixstyle morality play any daybecause you are already inwardly giggling at the nature of the thing when actual sight gags happen you just cant help but burst out laughingbut that aside the pacing of the thing is phenomenal chow knows how to reach the inner rhythm of the visual mind this is an enormously complex story with few things explained in words its mostly visual when you put together something like this the motions across the screen the busy and quiet moments the brutal and the sweetly comic all have to be modulated he does this with a quarter beat faster than everything he quoteshe does it in the large with the action sequences but in the small too look closely at the blood in the corridor inspired by the shining then go look at the original both slow motion but chows is faster than what we expect to seei always throw up my hands when i see masterful filmmaking skills that are obvious and powerful and turned only to the goal of eliciting laughter anyway terrific skill in the art is rare and you should see this and laughteds evaluation  3 of 3 worth watching,comedy
is clearly one of the silliest funny genuinely wellproduced comedies to come around for a long time it is so very refreshing to lose yourself in this farce knowing that the entire purpose of the film is to entertain but as in all good comedy there is also a messagetalented directorwriter with tsang kan cheongstar stephen chow has the whole concept of kung fu as entertainment down pat with the brilliant choreography of yuen wo ping as partner chow tells a skeletal tale of two wannabe criminals chow himself and his obese sidekick chi chung lam who will stop at nothing to become members of the canton mafia axe gang they blunder into a hick town run by a smarmy landlord and his bellicose wife to find someone to kill as that is the only way they can join the axe gang but this sleepy little town is unafraid of gangs why  because they happen to be the home of some expert kung fu practitioners after some absurd events the axe gang happens into the town only to come up against impossible odds and a lot of hilarious surprisesthe choreography and setting parodies everything in the hollywood repertoire the spaghetti westerns of sergio leone high noon antics busby berkeley type staging keystone cops zany shenanigans marital arts films  name it the film takes a shot and the shot outdoes the original the color and cinematography are terrific the musical score to which chow also contributed is a little masterwork of ancient chinese instruments garnished with contemporary sounds and the actors when not engaged in the nonstop fighting sequences just seem to be having the best time being silly for pure diversion and giggling entertainment spend an evening in the company of stephen chow and crew recommended even for serious movie aficionados grady harp,comedy
this film is freaking hilarious i cant remember the last time i laughed so hard afterwards i wanted to tell people how funny it was but every time i tried i would start laughing again simply from thinking about it stephen chow is incredibly funny and talented its hard to write why the film is funny without spoiling it but ill give it my best shot because kong fu hustle deserves to be seen without having any preconceived notions about itthe principal actors are all very funny and have great sense of timing and even though i saw the film subtitled it didnt make it any worse especially stephen chow is funny and both his posture facial expressions and general timing is high above average i also like the fact that he has a high degree of selfirony and is not afraid to let the joke be on him which pretty much all the jokes in the film are among other actors worth mentioning are wah yuen who plays the landlord and qiu yuen who plays the landlady they both seem enthusiastic about the project the supporting cast is pretty good as wellthe acting is not in the high seat however obviously the main attraction is the action and all action scenes are brilliant they are executed in a very stylish and aesthetic manner and are also very very funny there are scenes that were just beautiful and left me breathless but they never lose the selfirony which is so incredibly well executed and are therefore also incredibly entertaining much more than in other hong kong action movies like hero which in my opinion could have done with a dose of selfirony the computer effects are blatantly obvious but they still seem pretty believable within the confines of the film universe and they are generally very well done also i found the burly brawl sequence to be incredible and it had me in stitches overall the effects and fight scenes make the film very worthwhile and therefore highly recommendableoverall kong fu hustle is an incredible achievement in film making and everyone who is not afraid to see the hong kong action genre spoofed should definitely watch it810,comedy
stephen chow demonstrates once again that hes the master of the kung fu comedy flick i havent been this entertained in a movie theatre since the last time i sat in the back rownot content to use any basic choreographers stephen receives help from the legendary sammo hung and wu ping yuen these two experts of the genre deliver the finest martial arts fight scenes ive seen from any movie stephen enhances their choreography with astounding special effects and beautiful camera angles the wire acting is flawless and blends seamlessly with the cgibut this isnt just a boring action flick the script is chock full of sight gags and slapstick even the action comes with a sideserving of humour the characters are overthetop parodies of kung fu stereotypes  the bumbling fool the evil villain the mysterious assassin the serene master  and are played to perfection by the cast this movie is pure entertainment from beginning to end hollywood should start paying attention  this is what movies are all about,comedy
i cant remember a film that was as much of a joy to watch in recent memory as it is an entertaining riotous comedy that combines action and humor flawlessly to provide for a great two hours in the movie theaterdirected by stephen chow who is also the star is in some ways very much in the vein of the martial arts films of jackie chan in that it is not afraid to play as a comedy while featuring some outstanding stunt work and impressive stunt sequences unlike some martial arts films which seem a bit two full of themselves knows its ridiculous and revels in this factfor the uninitiated is a foreign film full of subtitles but that doesnt stop it from being entertaining to american audiences it is set in a city where the downtown is ruled by a vicious gang known as the axe gang whos leader brother sum kwok kuen chang has an affinity for executing anyone in his path to total control and power on the outskirts of the city in a slum run by an overbearing landlady qiu yuen two strangers sing chow and his slowwitted friend chi chung lam arrive posing as members of the axe gang they quickly find themselves in the midst of a brawl between the people living in the slum and the real axe gang it is only with the assistance of three martial arts masters who are living in anonymity and peace in the slum that the axe gang is fought off not content in accepting defeat brother sum seeks the help of outside killers including two deadly musicians and finally as a test of sings desire to enter into the axe gang he is forced to free the beast siu lung leung the greatest killer ever from a mental asylum to fight off the kung fu masters at the slumis a wild mixture of styles meshed together at some points it is almost a straight martial arts film at other moments it is a slapstickstyle comedy and at yet other times is a borderline live action cartoon as with many other martial arts films it often operates outside of the boundaries of the real world with actors defying gravity and the laws of physics with their wild acrobatics however unlike films such as crouching tiger hidden dragon which progress as if existing in the real world makes no excuses for its outrageousness and doesnt even really try to pretend to be realistic yet at the same time much of what goes on has an internal logic that works in the film and doesnt leave the audience scratching their heads and walking away with a feeling that the film is just too silly to be believedisnt afraid to reference many films that it is obviously borrowing from there are pieces of the matrix superhero stories gangster pictures and other martial arts films thrown in here but its willingness to wink at the audience makes its use of this material acceptable it isnt intended to be original merely entertaining by working with formulas and situations that most members of the audience should already be familiar withon the comedy front is outstanding it features a number of great moments including a hilarious scene where sing is trying to bait the members of the slum to fight him and quickly realizing that everyone he chooses to fight has some advantage over him it plays with many stereotypes and uses them to great comic effect although i wonder how the homosexual community will react to certain moments in the film and as with any martial arts film worth its salt the fight scenes are well choreographed and exciting unlike recent american action movies that overdo editing during fights kung fun hustle manages these scenes very well allowing us to get into the materialwhile i know this type of film is not everyones bag of tea especially with its subtitled nature i would heartily recommend this film to anyone looking for a good time and wanting to finish with a smile on their face,comedy
one name appears in the credit list of all these three movies  yuen wooping this brilliant kungfu action director is credited under three slightly different titlesaction director for fight choreographer  kung fu for kill bill kung fu choreographer for matrixthe latter two are better descriptions as there is indeed a strong element of choreography even for a movie there is a subtle difference between real martial art and choreographed martial art this is not to say that actors do not need martial art training many of the actors in kfh have had years of martial art training and some are even experts still most of the martial art action in the movie is choreographedfor real martial arts in a movie there is one legendary sequence that unfortunately is unlikely to be matched again in bruce lees fist of fury 1972 those who have seen this movie will never forget the crane shot of lee knocking down eight opponents with eight separate kicks but in one continuous flow of motion no cutting no editing no camera tricks here and not even taking a tricky angle  but one clear birdseye view shot where nothing can be hidden from the audience that is real martial art in a moviein recent movies the best martial art sequence is in hero a movie with crafty contrivances that i dont particularly care for but great cinematography that i admire here we have probably two of the best real martial arts actors today jet li and donnie yen and the scene pitching them against each other is marvelous that mind you is still a far cry from bruce lee but the best we can get todaythe first half of kfh does have some reasonably good martial art sequences but it soon becomes more like a video game than a movie as well the purportedly martial art elements are from excellent but completely fictional martial art novels with absolutely no resemblance whatsoever to what real martial art is like all told kfh is an entertaining cgi action flick but not a movie about martial arts despite what the title suggestsfootnote interesting to note the references to two very well known movies the shinning 1980 and ghostbusters 1984 to those who have seen these two movies it is impossible to miss these references these two are undoubtedly among stephen chows favorite movies,comedy
aka kung fu is actually the type of martial arts comedy that you can watch again and again it is very reminiscent of the numerous and enjoyable jackie chan movies in spirit and that is solely because it is stephen chow that is at the helm because he is every bit as good and funny as jackie chan just havent achieved half the fame outside asia unfortunatelythe story told in is good it is funny and it is fully and wholeheartedly entertaining there are so many aspects to the movie that it is hard for anyone not to find something to like here ranging from characters places events and suchis crammed with a great cast whom all performed remarkably well with their each individual role and character the movie is definitely superbly carried by the director and star himself stephen chowthe characters in the movie are half the movie because they are all so very interesting and colorful almost every character comes with a good backstory that lets you delve deeper in to the character and the character progression throughout the movie is definitely good as wellthere is a heap of action in the entire movie and the choreography is really good everything is fast paced and well executed on the screen making it all look phenomenally well on the screenif you havent already seen you should jump at the chance when you are given because this is definitely a remarkable movie lots of action and fun something for everyone,comedy
i saw this movie in the theater with my hard of hearing wife at the time movie theaters did not have closed caption devices like they do now so i would drag her to pretty much ever subtitled movie that came to town i knew nothing about what we were walking into we walked into greatness unfortunately none of the other stephen chow films that ive seen have done it for me to me hes a one hit wonder but what a hit maybe top 10 of all time,comedy
there has been no movie like this none period shoalin soccer was brilliantbut this is something elsethe character development is so rich that you will be wanting more from the lecherous landlord to the side kick of the bad guy and the side kick of the hero from the mega villain to the local juliet from the land lady to the 2 vile playing the piano even if they got a few scenes everyone stole the limelight in fact stephen chows character probably looked less interesting at timesthe scene where his sidekick accidentally hits him with a knife followed by kissing a cobra is the ultimate funny scenethee are so so so many good to better to brilliant scenes from all the characters that you would probably see it nth number of timesthe slapstick is bang on the overthetop scenes are even more bang on everyone is in top notch formit is mostly overthetop but what a balance stephen chow has maintained not even once does it cross the line to become even remotely senseless this is miles ahead of anything you have seen in fact a different genre needs to be specially made just to fit this movie this one shaolin soccer and cj7 are proof enough that chow is a superior director but i doubt he can top this there is just no equal it is like the psycho of thrillers the enter the dragon of martial arts the terminator 2 of action movies with this movie alone chow should be ranked as an all time great,comedy
this is my second viewingthe movie is unique because it has comedy kung fu and fantasy though predictable but still good not a scene is wasted characters are developed well and fighting scene is entertainingi wish for a sequel although unlikely,comedy
ok this is a very short review normally i prefer very hard and brutal fighting movies like the raid or the new dredd movie i cant explaine why but i love this movie so so so so much cause of its style i hope the maker of this this movie will do anothter one with the same style normally i watch a movie only one time but this one i have have seen now ten times or more please more of it and yes its 5 am in the morning and iam a little drunkt  ,comedy
is a movie about kung fu masters facing one another protecting one another and battling the axe gang i have never heard of this movie and i was told to watch it for my final for my perspectives class and i truly did not have high hopes for this movie but i was wrong this movie was absolutely great and i enjoyed watching it so much it was such a good mix of feelings for the viewer as well you felt sad at some points you felt happy in others and the rest of it was just plain exciting i can not tell you how much i laughed during this movie and i was watching it with my mother as well she thought it was weird but she laughed multiple times the movie also has an interesting mixture of time periods and mixing of different cultures it was sort of like a western film mixed with roaring 20s mixed with old school gangs and mafias like in the godfather mixed with a goofy stephen chow movie i thought the story line was goofy yet exciting and i would totally recommend this to anyone who wants to watch a goofy chinese kung fu movie i honestly wish there was a remake of this movie,comedy
this is a great movie in so many levels i didnt expected much about it i supposed it would be another goofy comedy that involved martial arts i was so wrong this film can be compared with those old time kungfu movies only that this has the advantage of special effects thing that make it even more spectacular and that the movie is intended in a satirical way it has a great story about a guy who only wish is to be a a member of the axe gang and when he finally have the chance to be part of it he has the chance to redeem himself i has a perfect ambientation of the post revolutionary china of the 30s great costume design the direction from stephen cow is excellent he gives the movie the perfect rhythm to make it enjoyable and to keep you on the edge of your seat it has a lot of funny moments the action and adventure is unstoppable it also has the necessary drama and even a little romance at the end the special effects are simply awesome the fights are perfectly choreographed that it seems real everyone in the cast delivers a very decent performance specially from stephen chow that begins as a bad guy and end as the hero of the movie in conclusion this is a very enjoyable and entertaining movie that has it all comedy action and adventure drama romance and even dancing such an epic martial arts film,comedy
while the name stephen chow might barely elicit a hint of recognition among western audiences theres no denying hes a legend back in his home turf of hong kong his films are often characterized by their zany characters overthetop action scenes and eyepopping sometimes literally special effects his earlier works such as god of cookery and shaolin soccer were uneven escapist fluffpieces that were weighed down by a tinge of superfluousness with however chow managed to find his footing creating a film that manages to rise above its genre conventions to become a veritable piece of cinematic artistry part action film part love story part loving homage hustle is a pitchperfect example of the best that hong kong cinema has to offer effortlessly mixing digital wizardry with oldschool martial arts stunts while never skipping a comedic beat starring chow himself as a hapless wannabe gangster embroiled in a headspinning battle between the notoriously violent axe gang and the highflying residents of a slum called pig sty the kung fu masters from the ramshackle village are faced with the task of thwarting the dastardly attacks of the axe gang which include a band of suited axewielding mercenaries a pair of stringstrumming assassins and a prisonabducted supervillain known as the beast fast enough to catch a speeding bullet all this climaxes into an goforbroke showdown between the newly enlightened chow and the malevolent beast and if thats not reason enough for you to rush to your nearest video store chow peppers the film with nods to everything from looney tunes slapstick to kubrickian surrealism as well as an inspired reimagining of the burly brawl sequence from the matrix reloaded a true gem,comedy
is a movie for those who like their kung fu films as over the top as possible this film succeeds in introducing every kung fu and wuxia clich imaginable and makes fun of them as often as it can the cast of characters is wonderfully cartoony as is much of the comedyon the other hand the film has a very severe story which helps it cling on to credibility unfortunately it also leads to the films rather sluggish endingim tempted to say that this is the hong kong equivalent to kill bill but its not as gory or even that serious its still an excellent movie by any measure,comedy
i saw this movie some time after the matrix fever settled hugely disappointed at the last two movies i didnt think wire fu movies could ever be truly magnificentand along came i was amazed and in awe there was comedy plenty of cgi action drama and even a bit of horror stephen chow really explores each and every bit of the action genre and even dares to mix in cartoonish actionthe playfulness and honesty portrayed in this movie blends together perfectly one part never play out the other its never too serious and never too silly its just right and youll probably sit with a quirky smile and feelgood notion in your belly at the end of this beautiful moviechows main character is probably one of the funniest portrays in a while its hard to describe last time we saw such presence both in acting and action sequences its not fair to compare him with bruce lee but that is the amount of presence he delivers in this movie bruce may have proved himself as a fighter but stephen chow proves himself as a creator and actorultimately is a movie that you have to see ive introduced it among friends and family and not one person so far has disliked it its a movie with a little bit of everything that anyone can enjoygo rent and watch it today im serious dont miss out on this one,comedy
i expected a lot from this since i loved shaolin soccers brand of humor not to mention brilliant cgi but man oh man chow did it again impressing me even more this is totally insane hilarious and just pure fun and entertainment i dont know about some people but if you dont find that throwing of 3 knives scene hilarious then you got some issues dont take the movie too seriously expecting philosophical idealistic projection of lifes depth because if you are run along fortunately im one of the millions of people who perceive chows humor to be funny but of course not everyone can understand the style and brand of his comic performance nevertheless all we ask is to put your critical minds aside and enjoy this kung fu masterpiecei love the martial arts the insane take on superfu slap stick comedy mixed along with showing the reality of average peoples lives cultural barriers may occur when people from all over the world see this but as i said dont take it critical nor seriously and your guaranteed to enjoy this gem truly another amazing entertaining fun flick from chowim looking forward to his next projects,comedy
absolutely awesome it left me breathless with laughter  blinded with tears thank goodness id been to the toilet before i started watching this movie highly recommended as it is on of the bestfunniest movies i have ever seen hollywood can really learn from stephen instead of doing remakes of classics they should something original this movie ticks every box for me as it so refreshing usually have to watch big blockbusters of hollywood that either have too much smooching or too much limbs flying about with siblings this is the first movie that i enjoyed with them in a very long time without 1 squabble i know its a miracle  thanks for saving a saturday night stephen owe you,comedy
good acting good special effects nonstop storyi caught this movie by chance last night on encore channel at first i was rolling my eyes thinking that it would be yet another tired overwrought martial arts story wherein some guy doesnt want to use his abilities until his love interest is captured by the bad guys blah blah blahhappily i was surprised with a masterpiece that parodies the ridiculously impossible fight sequences so common these days and does so without taking itself seriously instead of a love interest causing conflict it is a more realistic setting of a group of people resisting gangster strongarm tactics something that rings true in many placesalthough not a pure comedy you will chuckle and guffaw through much of this film i highly recommend it,comedy
but even presented in the shamefaced fullscreen ratio of a library dvd is a triumph of visual storytelling stephen chow is one auteur actorfilmmaker im glad i finally discovered has the noir stylishness of a sin city the spectacular sets and coloring and at one point choreography of a west side story the giddy antics and action of a chuck jones cartoon and the fantastic imagination of a chinese fairy tale all wrapped into one wildly entertaining movie you cant ask for a better cinematic experience ill be adding a widescreen copy of this one to my dvd collection post haste and making certain to experience its followup in the theateri havent laughed out loud at a film in who knows how long but did the trick kudos to everyone involved but mostly to mr chow who crafted his film so carefully that even the butchery of fullscreen presentation cant harm it if you dont like you simply dont like movies,comedy
while flipping through the satellite stations i seen and was totally amazed by the whole production this is by far the most enjoyable kung fu movie i seen with over the edge action comedy everything from the action wexcellent surround sound to the surprised but intensely funny comedy has me still smiling way after the credits i really do not like comedy because to me there is more stupidity than humor for my taste this action comedy really got me going and want to see more movies in this style this movie also brings into play the matrix style of entertainment that fits nicely from start to finish if you love kung fu and like to laugh than do your self a favor and see this movie i signed up with imbd because of this movie and to let others benefit in a superb production,comedy
trying to think of how to put a summary of into any long winded analysis is utterly impossible this film is severely cool this film is cooler than a polar bear with an intergalactic passport trying to get to pluto on an ice propelled icicle the film manages to work on so many levels necessitating for all those viewing it the essence of humanity and nobility is encapsulated throughout this story in a truly creative yet very simple manner this is in turn fused with comic moments throughout the film which give it a traditional and very effective feel good factor which is exactly the wonderful thing about this film is that it hits its targets plotwise precisely what you expect to happens does happen but perhaps in a different way than you thought stephen chow always elongates the plot revelation for a little longer than were used to in this part of the world and it is that which provides for engrossing cinema kungfu contains that zany feel of shaolin soccer with mr chow amiable and convincing as his usual buffoonish characters and yet also able to carry the serious side ensuring the viewing audience connect with this film utter brilliance shaolin was very entertaining but in a different way to this outing shoalin was out and out humour its subsidiary plot not as strong as the encapsulating football or rather soccer for some leaving it to be more of a tradition comedyfilm kungfu is an actioncomedy in many senses of the word but thats not enough it contains the utter height of coolness in a very die hardish sense yet leaves you emotive much like the first time you finished watching episode i in tears there arent enough alliterative puns to make about this films its far too enjoyable to simply dissect which makes it very hard to end a summary its just good very good,comedy
sing a young man who tried to be good as a child and got bullied and now decides that he wants to be bad and wants to join the evil axe gang that his terrorising an alley housing complex and killing many of the residents the axe gang finds out that the landlady and the landlord both are great martial arts fighters and they plan on protecting their housing territory so they get a legendary martial arts fighter as well named the beast to kill them in the end sing has to decide whether or not he wants to be good or bad the film blends action comedy and even romance together while using cartoon like martial arts moves winner of the hong kong film award for best action choreography best editing best picture best sound effects best supporting actor wah yuen who plays the landlord and best visual effects at the hong kong film awards and the hkfcs award for film of merit at the hong kong film critics society awards has good direction a good script good comedic performances by everyone involved good original music good cinematography good film editing good production design good art direction good set decoration and good martial arts choreography and visual effects blends together action comedy and romance and it all comes together and works very well the martial arts scenes are like watching classic childrens cartoons and the fight scenes along with the rest of the film are clever inspired and very imaginative the film is also a very good looking film and is nice to look at and the film has an entertaining story and is a lot of fun the film is like a big popcorn movie but it is made much better than your average popcorn movies and as of this year it was the foreign film with the highest cinematic release in north america even though the film has subtitles i think this film will appeal to a lot of people just because it is very fun and entertaining and very creative one of the most original films of the year and one of the best,comedy
this movie is fantastic and extremely funnyit is a brilliant comedy because its very funnythis is a parody to martial arts movies like matrix reloadedstephen chow is confirmed as a genius with this film and his previous filmshaolin soccerwas excellent tooi went to the cinema to see this without waiting great thing but i took a great surprisethis is an extraordinary comedyby my point of viewand i totally recommend this fantastic filmbecause movies like this deserve to be seeni die to see 2 but i will have to waitthis is a greatfantastic and superb filma must seerating  10,comedy
absolutely cool movie with action filled comedy blended fight scenes the stunt choreography is done to a level next to complete perfection  the movie however has some impact from matrix sequel of movies with the gangsters cladding themselves in black suite but reenacts all the superb action of a chinese shaolin movie that has its imperious stand over all other action moviesthe story outline is quite simple where the hero tries to redefine his kung fu image which he thinks he acquired in his child hood but failing to do so tries to join the evil force but in the end joins hands with the good force and fight the evilthe movie however fails in the scene  the turning point  to clearly throw light that stirs the hero to realize and defer from evil men to help the good ,comedy
from walking disaster to kung fu master the axe gang rules even the slums but sing chow comes in and finds some eccentric landlords who are king fu masters in disguise this is both a parody and a homage to kung fu classics which makes ample use of modern digitalization techniques to create hilarious visual puns and games imagine a film in which jackie chan and buster keaton meet quentin tarantino and bugs bunny says ebert kevin b lees review in the chicago reader will discuss the context of this movie in learned fashion for you explaining how chow puts ordinary everyday chinese characters back into a genre whose elements have degenerated into global clich i dont know that i appreciated all that but i could see this would be huge fun for the intense kung fu fan and i also could see the link lee notes with sergio leone,comedy
if you see this movie without knowing anything about it you may be thinkingwhat was this guy on when he wrote it however even if you know the whole story around it before seeing it you will be probably asking the same question the fact is he wasnt on anything he thought out of the box and rewrote the clich rules of the kung fu genre you really shouldnt think of this as a comedy it is full out kung fu action film with its tongue firmly in its cheek it is utterly hilarious and yet so breathtaking that its almost an art film the plot is simple a young man who wants to be evil starts a feud inadvertently between the reknown and dangerous axe gang and the poor district of pig sty ally however without really knowing it the axe gang has their hands full with the residents because they are more skilled than they are this movie is beautifully shot and the music hits the right notes it leaves you feeling accomplished at the end a feeling no movie has given me lately many critics have been saying this is looney tunes meet quentin tarantnoyou cant do that because this surpasses all of their work by 100 ,comedy
i was thoroughly blown away with how much i enjoyed this movie it has a full range of comic moments ranging from the wry smile to the full out belly laugh the laughs are a mixture of witty dialogue and the visualisation of farcical momentsthe plot centres on various martial arts masters protecting a village from a bunch of gangsters embroiled in this battle is sing stephen chow who at first instigates the violence but eventually comes to the aid of the villagersinbetween the stunning fight scenes and the great humour there are some moments of genuine pathos sings story with the deaf girl is particularly touching as is the moment when he tells his clumsy sidekick to stay away from himthis film has reawakened my interest in east asian cinema and i intend to pursue it i would recommend this film to anybody who likes to laugh out loud,comedy
i liked this movie  i liked it a lot pretty much from the outset i could tell i was in for something a bit different and it didnt let me downwithout going into detail or revealing any specifics about the action this is a little like a live action cartoon filled with outrageous action sequences and entertaining dialogue this film glides along merrily keeping your attention from start to finish with some genuinely funny moments and some stunning visuals i think you could find this deeply entertaining whether youre a fan of the genre or notdont go watch this film if youre looking for gritty realistic fight scenes because youll be disappointed think more along the lines of the matrix meets roadrunner meets iron monkey and youll be somewhere close to the marka good time to be had by all,comedy
was released in 2005 in india there was no hype no notion of what the film was like the trailers discouraged me a martial arts film with special effects phooey but the movie had me hooked it is the movie i enjoyed most that year it is truly as fresh and new a movie that has been made in the action comedy genrestephen chow has used himself effectively not allowing his character to overshadow the movie as a result other endearing characters are brought into light savage humor and imaginative fight direction makes the movie enthralling the background music fits right in as the end suggests a sequel is in the plans which is unnecessaryfor is a movie to be seen again and again,comedy
martial arts and comedy rarely go together unless youre laughing at a steven seagal movie only jackie chan seems able to get the mix right and to be frank most chan movies are fairly similar anyway but now there is a new judochopping comedian on the scene  stephen chow having given us a taster of his films with the amusing but bizarre shaolin soccer chow goes well and truly overboard with which is possibly the most overblown chopsocky action film in existence but unlike some this film is a great deal of funthe film take place in 1940s china where the police are powerless to stop the vicious axe gang from ruling the city but down in pig sty alley things are much more peaceful at least until petty thief sing director chow and his overweight companion bone chi chung lam begin masquerading as axe gang members and begin panicking the locals soon real axe gang members arrive and chaos ensues before long a fullscale riot is on the cards between the gangsters and their prize fighter the beast siulung leung and the residents with their assorted fighters but where will sings loyalties lie with the axe gang or the citizens of pig sty alley let me just say that although storytelling isnt the strong point of martial arts movies is one that bucks the trend it is at times hilarious as well as being one of the most visually stunning films ive seen imagine matrixstyle violence and kungfu with looney tunes touches such as the banter between sing and bone the moment where they try to assassinate the landlady qiu yuen is just brilliant this is probably the best asian film ive seen since house of flying daggers and is probably even better  i enjoyed watching this film more than i did watching daggers despite more cg being usedso whats not to like there are more moments that confuse than annoy such as the dance scene involving hundreds of axe wielding tophat wearing gangsters that feels more like bollywood than hong kong cinema there are a lot of people who like their kungfu films and who wouldnt like this  this is not your traditional martial arts film not by a long way but i love this film because it is different because its not sticking to the formula and is daring to do something original in a genre that has been stagnant for too long chow is to be commended for producing a brilliant witty and exciting film that will delight fans bored with seeing the likes of seagal grunting through various setpieces watch it and enjoy  i just did,comedy
i vote it a 10 for what it is aims to be  the epitome of the genre that stephen chow makes all his films in  a kungfu fantasy this is stated first as i understand it was badly panned in the us for being shallow in contrast to crouching tiger hidden dragon by tapping yuen wo pings experience from the matrix he finally achieves the effects to a very large extent of the kungfu novels we read his previous attempts to imbue effects into kungfus movies were quite good without any of the japanisation of design that seem to prevail in the other hk movies he uses anime gags true but his movies references will not alienate the older audiences watching kungfu made me excited it was like watching the genre finally getting the ultimate blockbuster treatment on a cg level it was satisfying but i am personally a nitpickler for realism it was the choreographed scenes that made it shine if youd watched matrix 2 and this youd draw the easy comparison in the groupfight scene of hero vs suits except where in m2 it was all badlydone cg here it was a true dance between stuntmen and cg i suspect yuen was the driving force for this human aspect and their choice of exkungfu movie actors was not only to draw the older audiences  but to enable realistic kungfu moves enhanced with cg compare the fight scenes here with those in the hk idolfantasy flicks and you can really tell the immersion near the end there was a brilliantly executed series of leaps by stephen chow it really looked like he was leaping than dragged on wires or cg like the frog scenes well done stephen keep it up explore the rest of the moves,comedy
was really funny and entertaining it was really exaggerated but not in a corny way i would definitely recommend it its a good movie to watch with friends its like napoleon dynamite with more plot and energy in chinese its not only fighting but romance and comedy i only saw one scene the scene with the harpists and i had to see it i knew it would be good the violence isnt gruesome either so its a fun movie to watch its not very predictable either if you liked kill bill 1 or 2 then you should definitely see i cant wait for the second one to come out it should be in theaters in spring 2006 its called 2,comedy
this film really surprised me in a good way i didnt know what i was getting into when i saw the film on dvd i thought it would be another crouching tiger hidden dragon but instead turned out to be an animatedlike comedy whats amazing is that this movie is dependent on cgi but the cgi is only there is move the story along not be the story it blended perfectly with the action sequences which were ingenious and believable and the fact that in this cgi environment the acting was natural is even more surprising kudos to director stephen chow for giving us a perfect blend i really also enjoyed how the story progressively gets out of hand and by the end of the film the action sequences are so enormous and spectacular you feel like you just want more and more hopefully theres a sequel brewing i definitely would see it,comedy
he may not be orson welles but asian wunderkind stephen chow isnt about to let that slow him down he wrote produced directed and even opted to star in the film which pays homage to the very genre it spoofs delivers this typically stagnant spring movie season a desperately needed kick to the funny bone while chow received minor acclaim with his last directorial effort shaolin soccer it is hustle that will likely make moviegoers around the world stand up and take notice of his myriad talents chow plays sing a wayward young adult trying his hand at mischief he longs to become a member of the widely feared axe gang a routine grift in pig sty alley leads to a huge brawl between the axe gang and a band of local kung fu masters pandemonium ensuesthe script while inventive is hardly the driving force of this wickedly maniacal picture chow has created what could best be described as a living cartoon the theatrical scenery musical numbers and outlandish camerawork somehow fuse together perfectly leaving the audience both startled and riddled with laughter the fight scenes are a bit lengthy especially during the last act of the film but thats to be expected and while the jokes dont always hit home the ones that do are truly hilarious while technically a foreign film will likely speak to most audience members through its universal languages of humor innocence and unbridled zaninessrating b,comedy
in his 7th directing effort stephen chow has created a exciting moving nostalgic ride that leaves you reeling from beginning to end one of chows primary objectives in this film seems visually stun the audiences filled to the brim with exciting action dramatic violence sophisticated camerawork and some of the best sight gags ive seen is no doubt a feast for the eyes so much visual action seems to be possible because at its core this film tells a very simple story it is deep and emotional but simple nonetheless the only part i found visually inadequate were the cgi sight gags their comic timing was right on but the quality wasnt as good as it could be pulling me out of my engagement with the storyif visual beauty was chows primary objective in this film his secondary certainly seems to be to pay homage to his favorite films contains countless references to american culture and films stretching from the 30s and 40s top hat 1934 and casablanca 1942all the way up to blockbusters of the past few years spiderman2004 and matrix reloaded 2003 this is not to mention the roadrunner legs that sing and landlady dawn and the assassins striking resemblance to the blues brothers this film is simultaneously like nothing ive ever seen and a highlight reel of great moments and references to movies i have seen and love stephen chow loves american film and he knows we do tooit should be said here that anyone can create a montage of their favorite movie moments clump them together and call it a movie what chow does in exemplary fashion is incorporate these moments and reference together into a story keeps us emotionally invested from beginning to end with plans for a sequel in the works chow may well prove to be a master of blending comedy action and drama together all while maintaining artistic integrity and keeping the audience nostalgic and loving it,comedy
i dont think i have seen a movie this funny in a long time in this day  age it is hard to have humor action  twists all in one that can be pulled offbut has it all the landlady makes this entire film a delight the story follows the axe gang vs pig sty valley the axe gang is one of those gangs who is fighting for territoryonce they arrive at pig sty things take an interesting turn of events i cant wait for 2 i will be sure to run just like the chase scene all the way to the theatre in order to be the first to see it if you see any movie on the big screen on dvd or on tivo make sure it is kung fu hustle,comedy
this movie is now my favourite movie of all time what a great movie it doesnt happen very often that a movie makes me feel this way for a long time i had three favourite movies which were fight club requiem for a dream andmomento now has stolen that title this movie has everything in it great humor action and a little bit of love thrown in for good measure i was laughing so hard at the knife scene my eyes were watering ill admit it started a little bit slow but then it definitely turned it up a notch and never looked back id like to thank stephen chow for making such a great film a have you ever killed anyone before ive always thought about it,comedy
only my reluctance to give anything a perfect ten out of ten stops me from rating this film ten what an absolutely awesome flick i just saw it with my husband and i cant think when i last saw a movie i enjoyed this much it had the whole package  style innovation solid and often sympathetic characterisation romance martial arts good guys bad guys comedy great cinematography pathos go see it now god i loved this movie i thought hard trying to come up with a single criticism and this is the best i can do  on occasions the incongruous sound effects are more distracting than effective thats it theres nothing else wrong with this movie,comedy
i have to confess to being a little perplexed and intrigued by the trailer for this film and was certain that it had to be checked out what an original and amazing film it was rejuvenating the kungfu genre in its totally out there form funning startling and at times plain cute this really was an adventure at the cinema go see if for yourself chow uses special effects in a masterly fashion like a painter with a vast and varied palette the cast are spectacular and their puny looking bodies make the stunts that much more exciting the landladys facial expressions are the stuff of acting genius in fact the whole look and feel of this film are truly wondrous,comedy
when i bought this movie i was expecting a chuckle or two and to see some pretty good fight scenes this movie went beyond my expectations and has to be one of the best movies i have seen all year the comedy had me laughing out loud the fight scenes were jaw dropping and to top it all off it even had some touching emotional scenes as well this movie has it all and it comes not from the united states but rather the far east where they seem to keep making movies that i thoroughly enjoy this movie has a gang known as the axe gang terrorizing nearly every corner of the city save for the areas that are poor that is until an aspiring man who wishes to join the gang literally brings the gang violence to this peaceful little slum town with its many colorful characters which a few of the residents are kind of well versed in kung fu we get to see this young man make several stupid mistakes and he seems sort of a klutz but there also seems to be a hint of greater things assassines are sent to deal with those who fought the axe gang and we get a very strange musical combo and a man who is so well versed in martial arts he is known as the beast great fights ensue but as for the comedy the best part has to be sings the man who wants to join the axe gang assassination attempt of the landlady of the poor town so if you like asian cinema and are in the mood for a movie that basically has a lot of laughs and action then this is definitely the one to check out,comedy
is a chinese film in cantonese and mandarin with english subtitles the film is set in the 1930s in china and is about sing a young man who tried to be good as a child and got bullied and now decides that he wants to be bad and wants to join the evil axe gang that his terrorizing an alley housing complex and killing many of the residents the axe gang finds out that the landlady and the landlord both are great martial arts fighters and they plan on protecting their housing territory so they get a legendary martial arts fighter as well named the beast to kill them in the end sing has to decide whether or not he wants to be good or bad the film blends action comedy and even romance together while using cartoon like martial arts moves winner of the hong kong film award for best action choreography best editing best picture best sound effects best supporting actor wah yuen who plays the landlord and best visual effects at the hong kong film awards and the hkfcs award for film of merit at the hong kong film critics society awards has good direction a good script good comedic performances by everyone involved good original music good cinematography good film editing good production design good art direction good set decoration and good martial arts choreography and visual effects blends together action comedy and romance and it all comes together and works very well the martial arts scenes are like watching classic childrens cartoons and the fight scenes along with the rest of the film are clever inspired and very imaginative the film is also a very good looking film and is nice to look at and the film has an entertaining story and is a lot of fun the film is like a big popcorn movie but it is made much better than your average popcorn movies and as of this year it was the foreign film with the highest cinematic release in north america even though the film has subtitles i think this film will appeal to a lot of people just because it is very fun and entertaining and very creative one of the most original films of the year and one of the best,comedy
are you bored do you live a boring life do you want something different in your life i recommend this go to the movies oh dont fret i know that lately the movies have been nothing more than a lot of disappointments mind numbing horror flicks and romantic comedies starring grade a actors of course if you live a boring life that means you do not have that significant other as of now dont fret watch yes i know it looks totally weird different and stupid but there is one sure thing this is one of the most entertaining movies in a very long time you do not need to actually think much but just sit there and be blown away by the visuals laugh your butt off at the physical comedy admire the jawdropping fight scenes and also get tearyeyed at the sentimental scenes is 95 minutes of fastpaced inyourface action that leaves you with a smile on your face throughout the entire filmfrom the first scene to the last you will be seeing things that you do not see in regular films for starters the beginning of the movie features a dance sequence involving a gang of professionally dressed axecarrying assassins is about a wannabe gangster trying to join the axe gang while the axe gang is having trouble with the strong citizens of a certain deserted area outside the city throughout the film you see the main character try whatever to join the gang and you will see the gang go to extraordinary lengths to teach the landlady and the landladys husband a lesson what makes this movie so great is that the movie combines good oldschool kung fu action with excellent visual and special effects and also a few action and chase sequences that look like they were ripped off of old warner brothers cartoons the plot is very simple and easy to follow but it will be all the chaos that will lure you into the filmfighting more fighting countless fighting it is all there whether it is one man against an entire gang a few citizens against blind assassins wielding a deadly musical instrument an insane man against a powerful couple a very loud lady against her husband or an oldfashioned brawl amongst the citizens just for the sake of fighting will deliver so much action it parallels the actionpacked kill bill volumes 1 and 2 and then there are the looney tunesstyle scenes the visuals shine during these scenes especially the chase between the landlady and the main character sing played by the directorwriter of the film stephen chow mostly the cartoonish action is for humorous moments but at other times the style of fighting also became serious at one point it even resembled dragonball z the infamous anime that stretched a plot to incredible lengths 20 episodes it took just to show one fightwith most good allaround films you also get your sentimental moments as well with this film there is this sad scene with sing and his bitter past and how it shapes up his personality there are other moments but id rather not spoil them for you the acting is not the worlds greatest but like most actionpacked films it is not necessary as long as there is enough going on to keep you on your feet there is a lot of slapstick and physical humor that makes up for the lack of jokes involving dialogue so if you are the kind that does not laugh at a typical businessman beating down two wannabe assassins or a guy throwing a knife at a woman only to have it bounce back and stab him then you are not going to find this movie as funny as other people wouldbottom line one of the best films in a very long time very well directed plenty of effort was put into this and it pays off plenty of action comedy and also with a dab of good music and drama fills the bill as the 95 minutes watching this is much better than just watching the typical twohour movie i had a lot of fun watching this reminds me of the old days when i would watch cartoons that have no plot whatsoever but did not matter because they were just fun to watch over and over again surely this film will not get the box office success that it deserves because it is too goofy for people and some teenagers and adults will fear that their ego will be tainted if they are caught watching this come on everyone watch this foreign masterpiece and do the hustle score 1010,comedy
stephen chow managed to blend irreverance and poignancy action and introspection violence and comedy satire and personal belief very very well in and this movie doesnt play like your mainstream fare some real thought and imagination went into the making of this movieone of the best and oddest bits was the scene introducing the axe gang seeing the axe gang members dancing showgirl style in tails and top hats was a unusual eloquent amusing way to express the power arrogance money and style they possessed at that stage in the movie the fact that the hero is not the main focus of half of the movie was also very refreshing looney toons style hyperbolic action scenes havent been used that humorously since blazing saddles and the resolution of the final battle was so different and cool from any other action movie i almost fell out of my seatlastly i enjoyed the political commentary embedded in the movie the riff by the bad guys if youre not with us youre against us as well as the lifestyle choices made by the heroes were notsosubtle jabs at current us foreign policy,comedy
as a movie viewer i am very hard to please there were maybe 6 films out last year that i liked so you can tell im not just saying this when i tell you that was awesome its funny its entertaining its exciting its a stephen chow movie like chows other films the plot is a typical good guys must fight bad guys story but the plot isnt what youll remember the cartoony slapstick and parody is topnotch stuff anyway the people in pigsty alley must defend themselves against the axe gang and its seemingly endless supply of assassins like a buster keaton film this thin plot is used to set up as many gags as possibleand for those who loved this check out chows shoulin soccer in america dubbed as kung fu soccer and god of cookery,comedy
while heading to the washroom during a storyline in the movie i was asked by the attendee how the movie was i replied like matrix meets crouching tiger and the three stooges it was everything merged into this new kung fu style dancing bad guys in the style of the sinatra era fantastic visual effects and just the right amount of comedy to morph it into what could already be considered a classic in its genre theres nothing more fun than a chow movie in this respect id love to see him continue to reinvent the classic style into something new like this more people will be turned on to a new brand of filmmaking mixed with an old style,comedy
the story about a village in china a group of black men and a man named sing to start kungfu hustle begins with some gruesome action which makes you chocked although it is a comedy it has blood in it but honestly  this movie is completely outstanding if theres one as fantastic as this one its got to be shaolin soccer while this movie blows your mind totally it is the cause of stephen chows inspiring directing and variate acting every scene in this movie are wellperformed laughable but in a good way of course  and totally astonishing its awesome that you automatically feel youre sucked in to the blending story with kungfu action comedy and almost crying cutscenes in other words a good mix of imaginative and wicked fights are round the corner all the time an theres always sumthin to look forward to a definite 1010 scorerating by me enjoy the masterpiece,comedy
chow uses a celebration of classic genres to take his viewers on a farce of truly epic proportions from serigio leonne to warner brothers cartoonsnothing is left out and you really do not mind being taken along for the ride it does not take a psychic to see where the road in this movie is going yet though the scenery may be obvious it is very enjoyable hilarious comedy mixed with action kung fu mastery road runner styled chases and unfortunately all to short dance scenes saw this with my 18 year old son and though he was reluctant to go see this particular film he was nearly choking on his popcorn from laughter though this is a film very unique these days i am afraid that it may receive limited screen time as you do have to read the movie as it is done entirely in chinese,comedy
its time hollywood and the public stand up and realise what a genius stephen chow really isa vibrant comedy with beautiful colours and cinematography i loved every second of it the action is out of this world very similar to the final fantasy games with special moves and what not but the movies winner is the movies charm and endearing characters each one has there own individual flawsand dare i say it better than shaolin soccer which i never thought was possibleif we had more talents like stephen chow in the western world i probably wouldnt have to sit through churn like boogeyman and be coolsought yourselves out hollywood you have a lot of catching up to do,comedy
stephen chow sing chis may be the most satisfying filmgoing experience that hong kong film enthusiasts have dreamed for in recent years some viewers may attribute kf hustles greatness to hong kong film industrys lack of quality production in recent years thus enabling kf hustle to shine through i dont see it this way i believe the films success owes mostly if not entirely to its own meritsi grew up watching hong kong hk movies when i was a kid i cherished what i saw on the screenbeing a child was great and hk cinema was larger than life to me as i entered adolescence i lost most of what i cherished action sequences that once took my breath away started looking cheesy compared to the latest blockbuster revered performances started to pale as they were mimicked as i understood more about life and how movies were made i never saw movies the same way again i became more critical and i thought the joy of becoming one with the movie would be lost foreveryet i rediscovered this joy in perhaps for the first time since childhood why is kf hustle able to deliver the joy of pure entertainment to a broad range of audiences from innocent kids to mature grownups that is to say how could watching kf hustle enable an adult such as myself to take a trip back to childhood remembering what it was like to truly cherish a film i believe this is the result of several important elements employed by the film firstly stephen chow in making a film in the new millennium has not forgotten the old ways the scenes in pig sty alley employ a background score reminiscent to those in traditional martial arts films from decades before in addition chow selects several classic kung fu actors as homage to the golden days of the genre including bruce liang beastone of several bruce lee clones in the 70s who is perhaps most remembered for his roles in fist of fury and legendary fok tv series and longtime sidekick yuen wah landlord these slick blast from the past strike a chord with older audiences while still managing to be refreshing to the younganother element that makes this movie such a tourdeforce is the transcendence above genre conventions kf hustle embodies the quality of a martial arts feature a comedy an action flick and occasionally borderlines a scififantasyspecial effects extravaganza in fact kf hustle is all of this and none of it what it is is nonstop exciting and unpredictable entertainment the whole way through never letting audience involvement slip when theres action you never want to blink for a second when the action isnt on there is always comedy suspense or complex drama to keep us involvedin my book stephen chow in crafting has reached the peak of perfection in filmmaking in the ride i was able to suspend my belief and feel chows magical world the very same way i entered the universe of my fondest childhood films without critiquing little details and that is just what we need sometimes1010,comedy
ok i dont usual post comments or my own opinions here but this movie definitely deserved my songs of praisei loved every single aspect of this movie the slapstick humour was at times unbearably funny the cgi and action sequences were on a par with the matrix just looked better in kfh to me with the amazing asian art direction the characters and acting were just awesome i loved this moviemy dad recommended i watch chows previous films god of cookery shaolin soccer etc which i did at the first opportunity and i have to say im now chows number 1 fan i really hope this gets the useu release it deservesfirst movie ever on imdb to get a solid 1010 from me,comedy
slow to start because of buildup  background this quickly moves from gory gangster flick  becomes the true comedy it really is the characters are often a little typed to standard but this is a spoof so that is to be expected  actually part of the mockery of the gangsters  martial arts fighters at which it is poking fun the gags are never tiresome some are hard to catch unless you are paying attention especially one where a character says something in english  the subtitle is in chinese i was sorry that it got the limited play in my area st louis mo  that it got an r rating i would let 13 yr old children watch this should have been pg13 the minute this one hit the stores i went out and got a copy if you like to laugh this one wont disappoint,comedy
and this one too i love this film ive recently watched this and boy was it hilarious and full of surprises and cool characters and their funny moves i like especially the ones done by the tailor and the old man and not to mention the fighting and action everything youd expect in a kung fu movie the main character who is a kung fu gangster wannabe is funny especially at the beginning when he challenges everyone at the slums they were all ready to fight but they denied him and i like the way the landlady who runs fast her moves were outrageous and the gay guy and the coolie they were all cool and they also have cheesy names as well such as coolie donut the beast etc recommended for all kung fu action fans all around and to fans of stephen chow watch it you know you want to and not to mention the funny references and movies they spoof expect to see references to the matrix the matrix reloaded the matrix revolutions top hat the shining spiderman kill bill shaolin soccer grand theft auto vice city and many more,comedy
there is a dish in south east asian countries called the rojak a mix of sliced greens fried fritters squid and eggs and topped with a thick peanut gravy it doesnt sound particularly promising looks much worse but locals justifiably pick their plates clean every time this much can be said of stephen chows erstwhile effort the dodgy cornball humour of shaolin soccer and now the chowster is back for another dose of shenanigans with already a huge hit in this region just like the rojak hong kong cinema and movies like kungfu hustle would never be mistaken for high art with subtlety thrown further out the window than the protagonists are during the action sequences and slapstick jarringly pitched at hysterical levels wedged in between dramatic sequences there is a feeble plot about finding ones true self and being the chosen one as the denizens of a local town must fight against the powerful axes gangsters but one cant seriously discuss narrative possibilities when the lead in the film uses such gifts as the hurricane power palm blow its a kung fu move diametrically opposed to david carradines exploding palm technique in kill bill one strike and a 50 foot palm print appears on the side of buildings you get the driftstephen chow is already a veteran in his native hong kong where he first started out in collaboration with or in imitation of that other master of lowbrow humour wong jing one dimensional caricatures feature prominently in these movies and chow puts on the same deadpan expression and parochial cantonese drone in literally dozens of bestselling films it is nice to see him maturing somewhat just like tom hanks did currently chow is already a reliable male lead in dramatic roles not that his role in kungfu hustle would stretch any reasonably seasoned thespianit is interesting to note the role slapstick in hong kong films it is similar to the recitativo in italian opera and the singing sequences in bollywood films they are interludes in the narrative designed to play to the audiences which says a lot about audience tastes western viewers not familiar with hong kong cinema have generally been perplexed but those of us in the know take it with a groan and quickly wait for the next kung fu sequence there are however several laugh out loud slapstick sequences in that comes as a nice surprise the surprise being that it was actually funny and reasonably inoffensivethe action choreography is first rate the special effects are hugely imaginative all in all the technical credits are above par for a hong kong filmthe references to the matrix are courtesy of great wirekung fu fights choreographed by the inestimable yuen wo ping but it is the less obvious references to terry gilliams the adventures of baron munchausen that truly bring a chuckle one of the characters is as fleet of feet as berthold while the ending is a nice touch a small boy leads a girl by hand towards a movie theatre and on the streets a peddler sells a series of kung fu adventure comics to another urchin as most young asian boys will know a kung fu comic promises fantastical adventures on the cheap very much in the spirit of this often low brow but nonetheless exuberant movie just like the baron on his horse at the end of adventures chow seems to wink its silly but fun hope you enjoyed the show and yes i did,comedy
ive seen many reviews about this movie and heard from my friends on how good the movie is but i have never had the chance to see it for myself until last night the movie is absolutely a piece of art representing many of the chinese wuxia culture this is actually the point of my summary about this movie this time instead of the overall this is because many people had already given enough appreciations to the movies storyline and slapstick humorthat i feel i can move onto something that many people havent talked about and that is the wuxia culture within in the beginning we see the three man fighting the army of the axe gang and from there we see their different kung fu techniques if one knows of huang fei hung the old man with the rings around his fist represent the metal wire fist a renowned technique the man with amazing kicks has the kung fu called tam legs while the man who mastered the stick techniques is actually the famous yeung family halberd techniques of china back during the song dynasty the trio represented their techniques and the spirit of chinese wuxia and kung fu culture modesty and righteousness how about stephen chow he knows the buddha palm which is in the story yu lai shen jiang ironically his archenemy fire god devil would be his master in the original story how about the couples the loudmouth landowner actually knows the lion roar while her husband knows the tai chi techniques both couples are extraordinary in the movie as they revealed that their disgusting image given to the audiences in the beginning had merely been only a disguise to their true selves as extraordinary as they are in real life the husband yuen wah is actually the colleague of bruce lee true kung fu masters he is how about the archenemy his desire to seek defeat was satire to jinyongs shao au jiang wu and shen diao xia lus the alone seeks defeat where in these two stories the winner traveled far and wide to look for challenges near the end the toad attack used by the archenemy was ouyengfungs attack in the condor trilogy the character was evil and his attack was known to be notorious in the trilogy same as in kungfu for those who understand the chinese wuxia this attack would seem not only funny but knowing its origin and how it fits the role of the fire cloud devil as hes evil here how about in the end when the beggar shows another kid several of his manuals i laughed hard at the sight all the manuals were of a very powerful kungfu in a certain wuxia story such as jiu yingyang jenggong and the yi yang ji which are from jinyongs condor trilogy just to name a few why are these so funny and significant this is because not only is the movie done so well the story so well written but also that it uses these kungfu techniques from various wuxia series to decorate the movie into a piece of art heavily saturated with wuxia theme and culture to many non wuxia readers and common foreigners they seem like nothing but to those who read wuxia and understand a bit of chinese culture this is a magnificent work of art to express chinese culture once again stephen chow has once again overwhelmed jackie chan and show what is true kung fu heroes are never required,comedy
i will give a ten out of ten its a movie that is impossible not to laugh the funniest film since dumb and dumber most funniest this decade in the ultimate comedy spoof with mixes of martial arts kung fu comedy crime gangster related cartoonic violence and lots of adventure the fight scenes are unrealistic but like kill bill vol 1 it entertains to the max stephen chow gives us a great movie once again after the funny shoalin soccer the movie is directed and also stars the same actor stephen chow if you like martial arts whether in movies are generally you have to enjoy this movie its unpredicatable just as you see a gang of 1000 axe gangsters you know it will be tough to defeat them but no there are better fighters one ofter another with their own skill non stop entertainer well worth the watch,comedy
is a movielovers movie it is also a nearly perfect film a terrific parody of actionfilm makingpast and presentwhile at the same time being just as slick and glossy as those modern films themselves there are plenty of computer generated special effects but chow choreographs some brilliant straightahead stuff as well with plain old stopaction and clever cutting to thrill us not just with the slam bam but with the pleasure of a subtly used camera as wellsome but by no means all of the films and film styles that chow simultaneously roasts and pays homage too include in order of most heavily drawn from include sergio leones once upon a time in the west the italian directors broad operatic and slightly surreal epic of good evil and revenge in frontier americathe socalled chinese sword movie of the late 60s and early 70s this genre is not to be confused with the pale and anemic contemporary versions such as crouching tiger hidden dragon the taiwanese productions of the earlier era were meant strictly for chinese audiences only a few dedicated art houses and the public theaters in the chinatowns of americas big cities ever showed these films they had plenty of razzle dazzle and fantasystyle fight scenes but the plots of these early asian films were complex and clearly drawn from the rich chinese mythology with literaryquality characterizations themes and plot constructionthe slapstick and pratfallladen action comedies of the silent eratypified best of course by the films of chaplin keaton and lloydchuck jones and his classic roadrunner cartoonsbrilliantly recreated in a liveaction sequence that had me doubled over on the floorcontemporary humorless overlyspecialeffectsdriven drivel like the matrix and the aforementioned crouching tiger the wonderful musicals of fred astair and if the homage isnt clear there is actually a scene where two actors are locked in a villainvictim embrace in front of a poster advertising an astairrogers flick in which the postures of the two dancers parallel the ones in the foregrounda treat of directorial reference that lasts but a few secondsthe films of independent director hal hartleywhere characters are suddenly and inexplicably and briefly placed in a chorus line for a brief dance that is essentially unrelated to the filmgangster movies of the forties andat least in once scenethe godfather chow even manages to work some heart not to say sentimentality into a story that is mostly satiric stephen chow wrote directed produced and starred in this thinga real wonder boy and a true heir to chaplin keaton and harold lloydif you dont like this film you havent been to the movies enough,comedy
is without a doubt one of the best ever foreign film ever made we all thought that stephen chow did enough of a great job with shaolin soccer but we certainly never expected this masterpiece is hilarious with very funny scenes this film was perfectly well set in the 1930s scene the fight sequences absolutely pummels the matrix trilogy into a puddle the fight sequence are jaw dropping with added comedy makes this film absolutely brilliant in many ways i was a bit surprised that this film didnt win any awards in the oscars golden globe or baftas as this could well be the best foreign film ever made i cant wait till 2 comes out this will be greatly anticipated stephen chow is a genius,comedy
my best friend said when i told him id seen this film wasnt it written by italo calvino thats one of the best descriptions i can think of for how deeply imaginative sly and intellectually hep really is im not usually the action flick kind in the same night i also rented the farewell a german film about the last days of bertolt brecht thats more my typical fare the quiet european character study of a great artist and the women who love him i twiddled my thumbs through it after having seen chows mindbending visual insights aside from the sincerity of the storyits good guy thinks hes a bad guy but becomes the best guyhero themehustle is a nonstop feast of turned tables of the literal and figurative varieties this is a wild and crazy action flick for people who dont like wild and crazy action flicks,comedy
forgive an old westerner for the iconoclasm of comparing a chinese movie to a japanese cultural phenomenon im roundeyed i cant help it but this movie reminded me of the good old days when i used to read dragonball the manga  before the same manga became overly stupid and boring and went too far with the whole theres always a stronger enemy thing back in the day dragonball was a quirky funny cartoony romp through martial arts and so is this movie its a pleasure to watch just dont expect realism the movie had a strange impact on me  it seemed predictable in retrospect but it was nothing of the sort while i was watching it in fact it effortlessly turned corners i didnt really see were there all the while regularly introducing new interesting and colorful characters for our entertainment,comedy
i think americans should see this movie if for no other reason than to get a better sense of chinese culture values and spirituality this movie could be the first major chinese film to compete with hollywood films cinema could be the new armsspace raceif i had to summarize the movie in one line id say its the story of a once criminals spiritual journey to enlightenment that redefines the notion of a kung fu movie youll laugh youll root for the good guys and you may cry at the end i did and i am a guyand if youre concerned about violence for your children theres plenty of it for them jk but seriously read some of the threads on the message board about that,comedy
it not very often that i go to the same movie twice while its in the theaters but this one was so good i almost stayed through another showing of it on the same night the opening dance sequence is worth the price of admission alonethe funny cgi effects are pretty cartoon like but theres also plenty of action scenes to keep you going its almost like roger rabbit sometimes with the over the top effects youre just waiting for someone to hit on the head with a frying pan and then have their head look like a frying panjust about every face on the screen has at least one funny moment theres the disgruntled tenant with perpetual plumbers butt the bucktooth and trampy local girl the chainsmoking landlady and silent and ineffective sidekick who can only grr timidly when asked for backupthe action doesnt let up much but you still you want more and more ive got to get this as soon as it comes to dvd its something you can watch over and over again,comedy
with most hollywood garbage these days being so formulaic and clich we can all be thankful for those making movies outside of la combines humor creativity imagination way out the box when compared to most us movies epic fight scenes and wonderful cinematography the references it makes are sidesplitting and the bugs bunny and shining examples stand out as two that are remarkably timed i think if you go see this movie and check all your expectations and disbelief at the door you will have the fantastic movie experience of being whisked away to another world the reason we see movies in the first place right,comedy
i dont have much to add to what has already been reviewed except that this movie is the one  a heck of a potboiler of a movie with a touch of class sheer entertainment all the way truly amazing imagination on the part of the directors mortal kombat meets the good the bad the ugly meets pulp fiction meets dumb and dumber meets 36th chamber of shaolin meets crouching tiger hidden dragon meets  what a blast full marks for originality full marks for copycat spoofing full marks for grace elegance superb acting special effects and entertainment valueoh and full marks for kungfu ,comedy
steven chow has become one of my favorite directors this somewhat dark comedy pays homage to citizen kane the godfather the shining and the bugs bunny roadrunner movie the film has virtually the same theme and setting of gangs of new york and still managed to create likable characters even though this is seemingly a more serious film than shaolin soccer it still has the playful humor that made it such a fun movie is a great mix of action cinematography and cartoon like special effects chows brand of humor and understanding of new and classic cinema techniques makes him a truly great director writer and actor i havent laughed this hard in a long time is what gangs of new york should have been,comedy
i feel like i do not need to see another fight or action scene in a movie ever again nothing could top this not the matrix not star wars not spielberg not even the most expensive hollywood block buster but theres a big difference in the originality creativity and subliminal nature of this action in a story with lots of heart and humanity at its center i am amazed didnt do better on its opening weekend in wide syndication in the us it took fifth place even behind new ashton kutchner dribble but i think wordofmouth will build and this one will be around for awhile in theaters people will eventually get over going to a subtitled asian film to recognize they could not find a more entertaining movie  anywhere there are scenes jawdropping and breathtaking in their sheer magnificence they build and build and build until a majestic climax i saw this in a theater in queens ny where the crowd laughed throughout and stood up and applauded at the end i am also shocked at the rrating beyond a few bloody scenes mostly at the beginning there is nothing at all to offend the kids most of the violence is cartoonish fun and with a few exceptions no one actually gets hurt they could edit out the few lessor violent scenes in order to expose this to a wider audience especially kids who should open their mind to the real potential of film beyond the stale clichd forgettable hollywood tripe sure to infiltrate the multiplexes this summer,comedy
a masterpiece of cinema takes everything from everywhere and mixes it up into a new breed of film this is a film that sets the bar on what can be done to amaze us at a new level its not all amazing visuals but great story telling as well something that will probably allow this film to live on for the next hundred yearsthe film has been compared to a looney tunes version of a quentin tarantino film and while its partly true it has to be remembered that tarantino has been raiding the work of filmmakers like stephen chow for years and telling people its his own stuff here we have the real deal and the action in this blows anything that tarantino has done in particular the house of blue leaves sequence in kill bill off the mapthis is simply a great film,comedy
whoahohohooooooooooooo whoahohohoooooooooooooooooooooooo everybody was kung fu fighting those cats were fast as lightning though it was a little bit frightening man this movie was off the wall i mean i would have to sing this carl douglas song to show my appreciation to the choreography was outstanding the plot was magnificent and the characters were out of sight its like partmatrix partcrouching tiger hidden dragon partlooney toons and all the slapsticks you can get out of this movie i just laughed my head off when i laid eyes on it stephen chow really did his thing here in this movie he laid the plans down flat and bam a terrific hit playing this wannabe member of the axe gang would be the ticket for him nope the landladyqiu yuen would be the person i could just pop her in the mouth but pig sty alley isnt as bad as the axe gang thought it would be having singchow set the fireworks on the gang would be bad enough his fat sidekick wannabe was even worse he stabs him dump snakes on him and worse yet annoys sing all the time and for the landlord and lady they would be experts in kung fu i was surprised when the landlady had the power of the lions roar no one could ever withstand that might even the beast could stand up to that except when the bell was used as a speaker hey there were no speakers in the 1940s were they sing wises up after the beating he endured and i think he should have been more wary of con men when he was younger i think he should have been giving a big bop in a few areas this movie was indeed a lot of fun and it very well made this would put jackie chans movies to shame forgive me jackie but this movie is great for all martial arts buffs in the world warning this movie is not for people with weak bladders and call 911 if your sides split hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha rating 5 stars,comedy
ok so youve seen a lot of movies if thats true you know most of the genres just keep imitating each other and there is a serious lack of originality however when watching kung fu hussle the only thing i can use to describe it is original it takes from a lot of different ideas but the overall feel of the movie is nonstop fun to the end its more like a warner bros classic cartoon in liveaction than anything complete with road runnerwile e coyote style chases with the feet blurred into a swirl as the chase heads down highways the actual look of this in the film is hilarious theres all kinds of cartoon like violence and such but in the end it just gives the film more heartthe film is a lot like watching a japanese anime animated more than watching an old martial arts film it has a surreal feel to itbut it really doesnt matter what i think of it i just say go see it it does have subtitles but the audience i was with did not care and i never do anyway there was laughter abound it is one of the funniest movies ive seen in a long time the acting is superb if they dubbed it it would have only taken away from itkung fu hussle is worth every penny go see it with some friends together for maximum enjoyment,comedy
i was lucky enough to catch a free preview screening of this masterpiece of slap stick kung fu genius and i feel that i should now pay the theater anyways let me explainsuppose god had a bad day and decided to cheer himself up by creating a new man this man was one part charlie chaplin one part bruce lee a half a teaspoon jackie chan and an injection of every looney toon ever createdthis is quite likely how stephen chow came into existencenow imagine that after creating this man god bestow on him an army of stuntmen a type writer a movie camera a hefty special effects budget and a eighty wardrobes worth of axes black suits and top hatsthis is quite likely how came into existenceebert has already said that this a movie where jackie chan and buster keaton meet bugs bunny and quentin tarantino but i think that needs to be amended  imagine a movie where jackie chan and buster keaton meet bugs bunny and quentin tarantino and then the whole crew go to a opium bar for 36 hours this movie was great at least as good if not a little better than shaolin soccer the smash hit chow made back into two thousand you never doubt the abilities of any random person to be a master of kungfu or completely not a master of kung fualso the cartoonish beating and contortions that every character seem to be able to endure are so brilliantly installed in the film that despite their utter impossibility no one ever questions their validity characters and fly through the atmosphere surrounded in an aura of flame and not even have a scratch when they reach the groundwhere sin city was a living comic book kung fu huslte a living cartoon and no one stops laughing for the entire time,comedy
there isnt much to say about this one is has everything if you like hong kong action movies you will love this one it ridicules everything in a hong kong action movie and it does it with style and very nice special effectsthere is a scene where the landlord is chasing a guy down a road in very very high speed that made me laugh so hard i almost wet myself and oh the landlord happens to be a martial arts specialist like so many other are in this movie actually most of the persons that have a story in this movie are martial arts specialists with their own moves and techniquesyou have to see it you will love it,comedy
this is a comedy but its deep if you have no idea at all about kung fu or if you understand everything about kung fu this movie will change your lifei have never laughed so hard yet come away feeling as if i had been uplifted and now understand more about the meaning of lifethe effects are fierce and yet organic the characters are strong vivid and effective the imagery and magic of the story and scenery and amazing overwhelmingly inspired soundtrack blend its like this film picks you up and never puts you down doesnt miss a beat and never spends a fraction of a second too long in any one spoti was absolutely captivated and immediately at home in this very foreign place so strangely retro and yet tangible its gorgeous and hilariousthe film has a release in the us limited next week beg borrow steal get to a theater  this is not for the small screen you must see this in a good theater house11 out of 10,comedy
wow what a feast for the eyes total eye candy from start to finish this movie does one thing entertain stephen chow brings back the same eye popping effects and cinematography as in shoalin soccer but wraps a story of a misguided hood that becomes saviour to a small block of people against a local gang this movie has it all from story characters action and plot you cant help feeling why arent there more movies like this the build up during the end of this movie is fantastic i wont spoil any of this fan for anyone but i highly recommend this movie if you want something totally out of this world at the end of this movie you are wanting more thank you stephen chow for this classic,comedy
stephen chow has finally come homefor sure this is the movie he always wanted to make a dazzling inyourgonads kick of a mindblowing kung fu flick i watched this about a month ago and im still ranting about it to friends and familydescriptions are pointless words useless if you like kung fu movies hell just movies go see this go now almost no aspect of the moviemaking craft is left unmastered an object lesson in how to push the boundaries of art and technology and yet still make a funnyashell kung fu movietotal respectmu,comedy
nowadays movies containing elements like kung fu which are originated from chinese culture seems getting popular in western worldthis movie is the latest one you can see fantastic kung fu fighting almost from beginning to end many actors and actresses have real kung fu skills taking the landlady as an example she learned kung fu with jacky chan from the same masterthe director stephen chow is a very famous comedy actor in china he is wellknown in asia as jim carrey in america this movie can also make you laughanother important thing should be mentioned is that the action director is wooping yuen who had directed in matrixthe visual effects of this movie is excellenttoo i guess youll never imagine how cool kung fu is before you watch the movie of course fighting with each others may involve some moderate violence if you think its ok take your children to the theater with you and you will have a good show,comedy
stephen chows name has been around the chinese cinema for a little more than twenty years his special style of dry humor is not only known but also recognized by chinese viewers as his trademark and uniqueness its only until recently with the release of shaolin soccer did people around the world started to take notice of this asian pop icon but when we thought it couldnt get any better he surprised us with his latest masterpiece being a diehard chow fan myself i must say this is by far the best work hes done combining kung fu with comedy is something that has been done since the 70s in hong kong cinema but very few is as entertaining and spectacular as the story is simple starting with chow a street nobody trying to be a member of the infamous axe gang which pretty much owns everything in shanghai except a few local small towns that quietly lays outside the city but it is in one of these small districts that hides the best kung fu fighters in this case its district of pig cage with the goal of extending their territories the axe gang found themselves in deep trouble as they stumble upon this small town of martial art masters viewers will find themselves drawn into the fantasy world of kung fu with funny fascinating characters that blow peoples mind away references to forrest gump the matrix silence of the lambs traditional chinese woosha novels can be found in many scenes i also find myself laughing so hard in several parts most of the jokes are easy to understand for they are usually short phrases or body movements this allows general audiences around the world to get pass the cultural or language barrier and enjoy the atmosphere its creating the action scenes are also visually stunning according to the design by famous action designer yuen ho ping responsible for crouching tiger hidden dragon and the matrix trilogy but being a long time kung fu watcher i personally thought it wouldve been even more superior with less cgi overall i give it a 9 out of 10 its probably the most entertaining chinese film to date this one will sure save a spot for steven chow in the history of asian cinema i think the movie comes out worldwide somewhere in march hope people around the world can also enjoy this film as much,comedy

wow sorry world but theres no need to ever make another kungfu movie gong fu or combines every classic element of the genre and takes it farther than humanly imaginable with mindblowing cg effects wire work fight choreography acting editing score and ultimately directing the film is able to be absolutely hysterical yet certifiably epic and moving if you dont believe me just look at the whoppingly disproportionate amount of 10s this flick received from obviously hardcore kungfu mavens whove seen it already personally i thought matrix one set a new precedent for the action movie and was vastly disappointed with the sequels gong fu properly fulfills the destiny of actionmovie evolution as well as make you wet your pants with laughter,comedy
stephen chow is without doubt the greatest comedy actor alive having grown up with his nonsense hes my constant source of inspiration for deadpan humour silly slapstick and dry wit so it comes as no surprise that i entered the cinema with mad anticipation it has been 3 long years since i caught the scintillating shaolin soccersc has long idolized bruce lee and so being the director himself is able to fulfill his childhood dreams to pay homage to his late idol and the legend of kung fu the endproduct is a cgi effects laden martial arts comedy fest that leaves nothing for the imagination which is of course not a necessarily good commentthe fighting scenes are topnotch no arguments about it a generous amount of screen time is dedicated to past kung fu legends who really do bring out the beauty of fist fights wooden staff wielding and amazing footwork added to the effects it is one hell of a kung fu film herein lies the problem there is simply not enough of sc and his brand of madcap nonsense that hes so capable of producing the limited times when he flexed his comedic muscles were the most brilliant moments of the film and not those when he ripped off his shirt to reveal his impressive sixpac or his littleknown martial arts skills i only wish i could laugh as hard and as much as in his previous efforts still sc should be respected and admired for putting himself in a backseat and let his love of kung fu take centrestagehowever to the nonsc fanatics this is a lovable film that will guarantee a great time in the cinema credit must be given to the incredible supporting cast like the wonderfully casted yuen qiu as the colourful loudmouthed literally landlady who give the film the extra edge in entertainment value there is no better way to enjoy comedies than to experience the joy of laughing heartily together with fellow audiences in the cinemawho should watch kung fu fans and anyone who is dying for some quick laughs who shouldnt watch sc fanatics wholl kill themselves if this isnt as good as shaolin soccer rating 77,comedy
i like this movie this movie is funny and has a lot of right moves of gong fu stephen chow has did a great job on acting a thief called sing also stephen chow is also a great director when i saw the funny parts i laughed so hard that my stomach feels pain when the final fighting sequence has come i really enjoy watching stephen chows performance now time for the plot and the performance in the movieplot1010 performaceacting1010 fighting sequence1010 laughter1010this is the greatest chinesei know chinese movie with comedy and jampacked with action when you wanted chinese action movies this movie is the one you would wanted to watch,comedy
stephen chow has done it again however this time better than the lastshao lin soccerthis is by far the best hongkie comedy ive ever seen even though it has a lot when i say a lot i mean a lot of computer generated graphics and it is very much fiction it is so artfully composed and directed that it makes the movie real goodit features many of the old cast of shao lin soccer but hey if it aint broken why fix it the acting is superb the plot is nicely molded it has a satisfying endingi havent laughed so much in months even though it is mostly comedy it has a touching scene where my eyes got a little misty it even has a little of romance the action wonderfullike most movies the bad guys will get what they deserve in the endremember kids crime never pays d,comedy
part of what makes a stephen chow comedy special is his ability to deliver a combination of nonsequitur humor while reminding us the harshrealities in life theres the betrayal by his apprentice chef in god of cookery the hardship of an aspiring actor in king of comedy and the lostcause martial artists in shaolin soccer what is missing with kungfu hustle is exactly that ingredient that made his past films so successful and what would turn stephen chow into a local hero both in china and hong kongto be fair chow had all the ingredients ready on the table but somehow they just werent fully utilized as they should have been what results is a very cgheavy film thats a cross between matrix volcano high 2001 a korean film directed by kim taegyun and kill billthere is greatness to homages when they are done in the right way and seems to be full of tributes whether it is the tarantino tribute with the axegang scenes kinghu with the dragons inn setdesign volcano highs cgtexture and feel or even scenes reminding us of keanu reeves fightsequence with over a hundred blacksuited villains in matrix reloaded the list goes on and he even throws in a stanley kubrick shot from the shining at one point its almost as if were asked to name the movies certain scenes or shots were inspired byinnovations chow brokeaway from the typical directoractorscreenwriter formula of having the lead ie chow take up all major scenes in the story eg ask yourself if youve ever watched a jacky chan film where hes not in almost every scene instead he gives ample time to the support cast of longtimenosee martial arts experts who were at the top of their game during the 70s and early 80s the villain leung siulung in was one of the top b film stars known for his bruce leetype roles 20 years ago we havent seen him since then and chow gave him a big homecoming in this film the same also applies to the land lady yuen chao she was one of the few stuntwomen in hong kongs film industry during the 70s if youve watched the man with the golden gunyes a bond film you would remember her as the buttkicking school girl who saved roger moores behind we all know of sammo hung  jacky chan but few of us know that she was actually trained under the same martial arts teacher as these guys since childhoodchow had the opportunity to follow his sentimentallead early on in the film in the scenes when we find out who the real kungfu masters were at pigsty and how they explain theyve moved to the village to get away from all the fighting and reminisce over their faded past those were some of the best scenes in but sadly all the potential gave way to special effects soon after what follows is a combination of 3dcartoon with contrived humoras a chow fan like most of the audience whom i shared the theatre with we all went to be entertained  to laugh to feel the melancholy but quoting a middleaged housewife as she leaves with her husband at the end of the movie its no shaolin soccer was this film made this way to make a better export the minimal dialogue after the 1st act all cgaction basically you could turn the volume off after 30 minutes and still get whats going on i wonder if this is a marketing decision so the film will be more easily digested overseasoh well what began as the most feared competitor in hk theatres during the xmas holidays no other hk film wanted to be released at the same time is at best a couldhavebeenbetter chow film hopefully his next films will once again have more weight on story and clever dialoguethats the stuff dreams are made of and we expect nothing less,comedy
this movie is one of the most funny and most entertaining karate movies i have ever seen the best the animations and the karate and stories keep you at the edge of your seat and you cant go 10 minutes without laughing until your stomach burns you have to watch this if you like movies at all ive watched it 4 times now and each time its just as goodbe sure to get some popcorn and some snacks and it has english subtitles which are by far one of the best subtitles ive seen to date its very clear and descriptive,comedy
omg omg omfg i went to the screening in chicago last nightstephen chow is a comedic genius  i cannot praise this movie enoughno spoilers from me but the full house was enthralled laughing and had a fantastic time the storytelling was wonderful the cgi was not too obnoxious there were just enough fight scenes and the soundtrack was perfect every chowcrony was tailormade for hisher role and what a treat to see the oldschool kung fu stars stephen chows 3 years of work on this film totally paid offgo go go to see this hilarious exciting touching action masterpiece ,comedy
this is absolutely the best stephen chows movie prior to shaoling soccer people were writing him ie his unique style of moviemaking off as a hasbeen but shaolin soccer proved that he remains current and relevant to cinemakungfu hustle perfects stephen chows unique blend of farcical action and heartwarming story telling perfect use of cgi technology plus plenty of real kunfu fighting tookungfu hustle is greater than a mere parody and spoof of martial arts film stephen chows characteristical mo lei tow rough translation without rhyme or reasonis toned down in this movie but still shines where it matters eg the dagger throwing scene the final scene was a illuminating mix of mo lei tow and zen like wisdom  ie when the villain asked stephens character what awesome kungfu was that stephen flippantly replied you want to learn i will teach youwhat a intriguing end to this excellent movie ps a previous reader was wondering how did stephens character acquire such powerful martial arts in the first place it was mentioned in the film by the landlady and her husband that the punches the villain threw at stephen opened up the latters chi and released his innate kungfuness again this sort of plot device is not uncommon in classic kungfu shows,comedy
im not a great fan of stephen chows but i must say this one really made me change my mindwell one can say kung fu kf is slapstick or owe too much to cgi and special effects what really captivated me were the characters in the movie most of them are outright weird but they are so uniquely comical and memorable in their own ways from the shabby dwellers to the blind killers to the sloppy fight masterthe fight sequence easily rivals that of the matrix and yuen wooping did it again im totally immersed in this surreal imaginary world for the entire 90min worth every penny of the tickets but i did leave the cinema with a serious cough for laughing too hard too much,comedy
is one of many high rated modern chinese movies where i dont understand how comes its so well received and critically acclaimed in the whole wide worldi must admit that the movie kicks off with a couple of solid jokes and some sympathetic characters that may addict you the first twenty minutes or so are entertaining and promisingbut the downward spiral starts soon after the lazy stereotypical but somewhat sympathetic character of the main heros corpulent friend almost disappears the fight scenes move away from aesthetics and get more and more random ridiculous and unreal the plot development is strange but not in a good sense the dialogues are thin and seem as if they were written in a hurry we get some horrible special effects towards the end that add the little cherry on the top of your cheese cakeim aware of the fact that this movie somewhat wants to parody the stereotypes of classic chinese and hongkong kung fu movies im a big fan of these old films and i have no problem with a good comedy or a solid homage to them this movie is not an original parody with many djvu moments but a very childish attempt to attract a larger public the jokes work in the beginning but the same ideas are repeated all the time and we get to see more and more exaggerated fighting techniques with over the top slapstick moments throughout the whole movie many movies that mix martial arts with comedy fail to find a good balance between both styles and i dont like most of these attempts but this film here is one of the worst attempts to combine these two genres i usually adore asian humour a lot especially in many south korean movies but this one is comparable to the bunch of hollywood parodies that came out when scary movie rose to famein the end i would only recommend this movie to somebody that laughs about anything and almost only watches any kind of comedy movies any fan of the artistic side of martial arts or modern chinese cinema should stay away from this superficial embarrassment,comedy
i saw this movie in theaters and it was the funniest movie ive seen in years it was extremely well done and i was quite surprised that the humor translated so well form chinese to english subtitles the compositing was masterful and the kung fu was very entertaining overall this was my top movie of 20042005unfortunately the same does not ring true of the recent dvd release rife with anticipation i bought the dvd the day it was released sadly enough it has apparently been reedited into an inferior version several shots were altered or removed completely and the subtitles were changed into less funny dialogue its amazing what a few tweaks can do to ruin a great filmif you can find a copy of the theatrical release i highly recommend it but if all you can find is the dvd release dont bother its simply not as enjoyable,comedy
i have to say this movie is very entertainedunfortunately i feel this movie a little chinese say that tiger head snake tail which means big starting small ending the ending of this movie is too soon chow is extremely weak before never learns kungfu from others before even an old lady can beat him and then he changes to be superman suddenly the story actually still works but you might feel everything goes too quick finally therefore i am thinking chow is going to release a directorcut version later just like what he did for shaolin soccer in hongkong this is businessand compared it to chows other productions this movie almost depends on action even the funny stuffs so it lacks much language fun i saw all of his other movies many times i dont blame him because i know he wants to enter hollywood i just want to say chow has changed not just this in the movie his style has changedanyway this movie is really entertained exciting and funny you wont want to miss it i give it 810,comedy
the movies plot is pretty basic with a guy named sing he does no singing wanting to become a member of the axe gang thats really all you need to know about this what matters is that the effects are gorgeous and theres so much going on all the time at least i could remember the main characters name we get one awesome kung fu scene after the other are kung fu movies the only chinese films that have ever been released in the united statesi literally cant think of a single one ive seen that wasnt a kung fu movie theres always ways this movie tops itself adding more insanity to the mix its hard to even pick a specific fight scene that was my favorite we even get some great jokes along the way it probably does help that a film so over the top doesnt take itself seriously let me just say youre on a roller coaster ride of a movie 12,comedy
i will limit my review to one scene as many people here have given very in depth and concise reviews of the film as a wholemy scene of choice is the blind lire assassin one of the two fighters that use stringed instrumentsfirstly there is a scene that primes you for the sort of skill these guys have a man walks past one of the players as he tunes his instrument what happens next is what i would class as one of the top primes for an upcoming scene ever as the music plays you see various subtle interactions between the music and the power it holds twigs and leaves are cut eves are disturbed and foliage is russelled this ends with a fatal chordlet me just review this the setting for this scene is awesome the colours and lighting in combination with the cgi and camera angles are something to aspire to the music is given a physical presence by the magic of film just the concept realisation that a musical instrument when played can be a deadly weapon is something the western world would never conceive of nor dare to use in a film makes this scene and the main musical battle scene one of the best realised moments in film everi have never seen 30 seconds of better designed film in my life unless i discount the main musical battle scene the main scene i just will not describe you will have to see it to understand how near to perfection it ishollywood has a long way to go to match what hongkong is doing with cgi and 35mm now the only difference is that hollywood can out hype all other production communities in the world lets face it what america produces in film it has already sold by ramming it down our throats for the months leading up to the releasehk will some day outstrip the us in the film world it has only to master the english language this film is a sharp poke in the ribs for all of those fat yanks raking in your money for any film part 1 thru 8 the sequel,comedy
some self styled uber sophisticates would easily dismiss this movie without even seeing the preview i was an unfortunate victim of such idiots who ended up preventing me from seeing this movie in the cinemas when it released while i still had the impression from those clods that this movie wasnt so great i did notice that everyone who did see this movie were raving about it i finally got to catch it on the small screen and it rocked at times the movie can strangely go over the top and cartoony and then settle back right down into seriousness there are just so many cool ideas within this movie which have been so effectively implemented the kung fu choreography is great the story is quite nice enough said go see this movie again,comedy
the stylish and stylized is as its name implies a goofy martial arts parody done with rare good humor and a keen sense of the absurd it is a tale of gangsters and wannabe gangsters going up against a half dozen or so of the finest fighters in the lower class part of town however the plot is merely a framing device for a series of amazing fight sequences that showcase not only the performers incredible skills as stunt men and women but the filmmaking prowess of those behind the camera as well writerdirector stephen chow who also plays the main role turns his fleshandblood actors into the equivalent of cartoon characters unaffected by the laws of gravity and physics as they are stabbed repeatedly fall from impossible heights and suffer incredible bodily abuse only to pick themselves up dust themselves off and continue on fighting as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened the razor sharp editing and multispeed camerawork  ranging from fastmotion to freeze framing  also contribute immeasurably to the surrealistic tone of the filmits true that is definitely an acquired taste and to those who are not aficionados of the art form much of the movie can seem repetitive and silly and even for the most passionate of devotees it can still be too much of a good thing the plot is frequently incoherent and the characters waferthin but the stunning look and extraordinary energy level of the film make it a mustsee for diehard fans of the martial arts,comedy
the best entertainment film of the year up to now comes from a very unexpected source  for me at least i am no fan of the kungfu films genre and i am not sure if i have ever survived such a movie for its whole duration certainly films like crouching tiger hidden dragon hero and house of flying daggers may be mentioned here but i do not believe that they belong to the category they are rather more like historical legends with the martial arts part of the artistic fabric same as the camera work or the musichere we deal with a very different approach director stephen chow takes the popular entertainment genre of kung fu action and a very basic melodramatic story and immerses it in a sea of fun creating an extravaganza of color images effects and gravity defying ballet the film is both violent and funny it has some of the gruesome violence of terentino and the innocence of the mute comedies at the same time the supreme master of fight effects yuen wo ping crouching tiger matrix kill bill is at his bestsuperbe entertainment by any scale,comedy
my brother in law rented this movie and i never really a big fan of stephen chow but nonetheless i knew his movies are funny or expect to be funny so i watched it and it turned out to be a funny movie forget about the lack of whatever just enjoy the movie and all minuses will be forgotten because we are not critics and we go to the movies to be entertained and thats what this movie does its entertaining and thats what matters its not about a movie with top notch special fx or a movie with gorgeous girls and handsome guys but its about stephen chows effort to combine martial arts with a bit of laughter and he succeeded at the end of the movie youd know you already spent your money wisely cause it made you laugh theres another movie of his that is also very funny its about him looking for the 9th wife and hoping shes not a gambler like all his 8 wives cant remember the title but its extremely funny from the beginning to the end hope you guys can find it,comedy
is a good film about kung fu and also involves comedy love and buddhist philosophy i feel stephen chow did an great job with the pacing and story line those of you who are matrix fans will instantly recognize the choreography and wire work of yuen wo ping in the fight scenesa lot of characters in the film could be taken at face value but you can also get a deeper meaning for instance on the surface the axe gang is just a mob but they could also represent the oppression of working class people or the brutality of oppression ingeneral sing chow represents the desire of humans to transform and better themselves even if that means joining a gang because he wants respect the idea of fate also weighs heavily in the movie fate had 5 kung fu masters living in the same place but no one knew it sing a mugger is really a kung fu master the film also speaks to standing up and doing the right thing sing makes a decision to help the landlordlandlady and fight against the beast and winds up changing his destiny as far as the kung fu the martial arts is used to protect and defend which is a great contrast to the violent murders committed by the axe gang the movie also speaks to the chi concept an inner power or force that all individuals are supposed to possess for examplethe villains who use the lyre musical instrument which looks like a harp for the lap to fight against the masters never physically touch them yet they are using chithough in a negative sense to destroy the masters their negative energy is represented as a force that is used for evil contrast that with sing who uses the buddhist palm for good and eventually tames the beast the love story between fong and sing represents the strong protecting the weak there was a lot of slap stick comedy in the movieeyeglasses guyrunning at high speedswhich was effective the movie is entertaining and it was cool to see the axe gang get their dance on looking forward to the sequel,comedy
i thought this film was absolutely immense it is quite possibly the best overall martial arts film ive seen i sat there for minutes after the end just dribblingmetaphorically  when i was younger i was a big bruce lee fan still am of course his films were my yardstick for measuring good martial arts action jackie chan raised the bar in terms of taking the art forward in the medium of film and i am still hugely impressed by the fact he does his own crazy stuntswith the major advances in special effects in the last few years there has been an explosion of kung fu related films a lot of them in the crouching tiger ilk which goes back to the old school of fantasy fighting flying through the woods etc i love these kind of films but they were missing something that i longed for from the bruce lee filmscombines all the things i like about martial arts films great special effects superb fighting skills a little bit of a love interest thrown in the revenge aspect the always a bigger fish idea comedy and a good mix of cartoon and brutal violenceanybody who likes martial arts is gonna love this film of that i have no doubts i cant wait for the sequel,comedy
i laughed hard this i believe is a very good sign when you watch a comedyis partly a movie parody as it takes lots of element from other movies spiredman the shining to name a few but it mostly concentrates on doing impressive yet so over the top action scenes that you cant do nothing else but to laugh out loudin 1940s china the streets are ruled by the gangs and the most notorious of all are the axes sing stephen chow is a petty criminal who wants to be a member of the axe gang so he decides to rough up a slum area in hopes to impress the gang leader too bad the slums are home for the legendary kung fu masters and they wont give up their home that easilyas said the script takes lots of elements from other movies as it is a parody i found this movie to be lots of fun even though im not an expert in the field of kung fu films im rather sure that the experts in that field will find more familiar elements from the film than i did as the main element of parody is martial arts films but there really isnt any expertise required in that genre to fully enjoy the film,comedy
this movie was the 2 movie to ever made laugh and later laugh more first with its parodies and moments of rip offs from other movies which made laugh almost uncontrollable the effects in the movie are riveting with the hyperbole and endless amount of an obvious sense of irony its something artistically wonderful and very funnyits storyline is very good one with allot of elements of the prequel and also allot of details of sings life when a kidthe fat sidekick with problems of sweat and his companion on his endless quest of entering the axe gang that sees him as scumthe super powers of the people in this movie are like bugs bunny with jackie chan with special effectsbut in the bottom line its a very very good movie,comedy
this not just a mustsee this is a must buy movie here is an amazing film about love respect class memories and most of all kung fu funny even hysterical at times is nonstop action and incredible filmmaking the fight sequences are richly choreographed the action while violent is never grotesque but rather beautiful thanks to the phenomenal cinematography a standing ovation for writerdirector stephen chow in delivering the film of a lifetime  even the dialogue is smart and intelligent i understand this film was a testament or tribute to the classic films of hong kong past and future if so does the genre right celebrating what all of us love about the greatest films from hong kong have you noticed by now i have not really told you anything about the films plot or premise thats because can be a lot of things for different viewers  i dont want to say the film is this or that it is multidimensional weaving so much intelligence and human emotion in just 98 minutes,comedy
all right  stephen chow is extremely clever and i understand and appreciate what he was trying to do this was one of the most creatively derivative films ive seen in a very long time and once you get into the looney tunes frame of mind the slapstick humor does workthe biggest problem for me was that the first six or so minutes of the film were not only unnecessary but incongruous with this frame of mind and made it nearly impossible for me to make the switch for the next twenty minutes since there was a written preface on screen about the gang wars before the viewer was transported to pig sty why were the unfunny and brutal opening scenes needed i found myself wondering if the beginning was the last thing added on the advice of an executive steveo you should do a gangs of new york sendup im no tarantino fan i cover my eyes during scorsese films and seeing an unarmed woman shot in the back body and blood flying isnt exactly my idea of a good time it made it kind of hard for me to get into jackie chan mode i may be sensitive but i dont think thats such a bad thingi also had to comment on the dumbeddown infusion of buddhism in the filmits disappointing to see such a simplistic western john wayne representation of a religion i admire but in a story like this where you have to have good guys and bad guys and the bad guys must be destroyed i guess you have to have a cosmology closer to the more fundamentalist of the biblebased religions chows lostboy character was the only indication that good and bad are more complicated than that,comedy
recently the chinese basketball player yao ming took some issue with his exotic image in the american media we are all living on this planet i did not come from space americans sent people to the moon 40 years ago the moon is much farther than china to me that seems nicely observed and not unrelated to what makes or any foreign film successful how it lets us see how much we all have in common i waited until id seen this one twice before commenting on it to see if it would hold up as more than a kind of liveaction asian roadrunner cartoon it was even more impressive the second time and its hard to imagine it would work as well without the landlord and landlady characters especially the latterqiu yuen like the rest of the cast was unknown to me i was kinda stunned upon looking her up in imdb to learn that in 30 years she only has two movie credits the other being the man with the golden gun quite possibly the lamest james bond flick ever made as horrible as that one was i may need to rent it just for a glimpse of the young qiu yuen whom i confess i dont remember from my cinema viewing of it but maybe i was in the bathroom when she was on screen in hustle she fleshes out her twodimensional character who gets called fat by everyone but i wouldnt have said so zoftig maybe with equally deep reserves of bitterness and compassion holding sway over a slum neighborhood in depressionera shanghai her rule is authoritarian but not cruel or capricious shes been letting the residents slide on the rent and even when she makes a drastic move like shutting off the water its measured the water will be available not every day but every other day working an omnipresent cigarette like bogart in his prime her expression seldom shifting she more than holds her own with the residents her philandering husband and various criminal types who happen along as the movie unfolds ever more surprising aspects of her background come to the fore but i think its the early slum scenes that will hold the fondest place in my memory whats the chinese for you go girl i havent yet mentioned the films protagonist played by directorcowriter steven chow mainly cause he didnt make much of an impression on me he seemed mostly a plot device although his underplaying was effective in hustles funniest scene a botched assassination attempt involving knives and snakes that reminded me of a scene in woody allens sendup of russian period epics the blandness of the lead character undercuts the effectiveness of the reunion scenes with the mute icecream salesgirl this aint exactly charlie chaplin in city lights i enjoyed the entire cast especially brother sum who came off as a kind of chinese will smith equally adept at dancing or murderits an absolute mystery why hustle got an r rating theres no sex in it no profanity unless it was omitted from the subtitles and as for the violence after the gritty opening scene featuring a guy getting his lower leg chopped off and a woman getting shotgunned in the back i defy anyone to show me what would disturb any young kid whos played at least one video game or watched cartoons on tv hell spongebob squarepants has violence thats more disturbing if one wants to see it that way if hustle deserved an r then the recent sin city deserved an xxxxxxx feel free to add more xs i admit part of hustles appeal to me was the tonic effect it had after the relentlessly sick and nasty city seems a shame we keep discovering these asian stars relatively late in their careers but then again maybe things happen when and as theyre meant to to echo a theme from hustle god bless facets rentals for keeping that retrospective window open i dont know how else i could have seen zatoichi the outlaw among many othersspoiler for animals loverstheres a sequence in hustle involving some hired killers who wield a stringed musical instrument that generates flying daggers and in a possible nod to lord of the rings a squad of ghosts wielding daggers in one mostly silent scene that conjures up jacques tourneur at his poetic best a targeted victim walks along at night while objects around him get silently cut in half at one point a cat leaps off a wall then as the camera pans along we see the cats shadow get cut in half and then some blood spatters against the wall it is what it is and ive been a cat fan for decades ive walked out on movies if i thought anticat violence was imminent but here if taken in context it shouldnt bend anyone out of shape just thought id mention itanyone whos read a few of my reviews should be aware i often seem to slide past the main point of a given film but just for the record yeah theres lots of kung fu  its fun  lots of movie references the shining etc etc  theyre fun even the ostensible homophobia directed at the character of the tailorkung fu master shouldnt put anyone out if taken in context when the landlady asks him whats with the red underwear if one cant chuckle at that ones probably watching the wrong movie,comedy
this is a one of a kind movie a friend who saw it with me had never seen a stephen chow movie prior to this one and was shocked just shocked at how great he and the movie both were he says this is just a brilliant movie over the top yes but in a great way oh those unforgettable characters like the landlady the martial artists living ordinary lives the poverty stricken hong kong that we rememberincidentally this movie puts other ones to shame because although there are lots and lots of cgi the martial artists are real masters who need no cgi at all not flimsy actors who rely solely on cgi to do anything the acting was just right veering from comedic deadpan to pitiful pathos we laughed from start to finish and then laughed for another 30 minutes after the movie finished everyone vows to see it again for us jaded movie goers this is a first,comedy
i saw this movie with my husband in los angeles a couple of days ago i loved it my husband thought it was awesome too we thought it is one of the funniest movie of the year a lot of other audience were laughing the whole time as well the movie is not a typical kong fu action movie it is more like a comedy plus action i am more impressed with stephen chows humor than the action scenes i think the movie has a good story line and an unpredictable ending which is very rare for comedies i would recommend this movie to all my friends i saw this movie with my husband in los angeles a couple of days ago i loved it my husband thought it was awesome too we thought it is one of the funniest movie of the year a lot of other audience were laughing the whole time as well the movie is not a typical kong fu action movie it is more like a comedy plus action ipersonally am more impressed with stephen chows humor than the action scenes i think the movie has a good story line and an unpredictable ending which is very rare for comedies i would recommend this movie to all my friends,comedy
i have only recently found out about stephen chow i watched shaolin soccer on tv then i found a copy of both great movies they are unlike anything i have ever seen i would recommend them to anybody who is into asian comedyaction movies i hope to see more of stephen i enjoy to watch a movie and have my ribs hurt from laughing then to be wowd by the excellent martial arts and special effects again i am dazzled by the way that stephen finds ways to pull the audience in the movie and as well lighten the mood by instantly forcing you to break out in laughter even at a point where you have become totally enthralled so i end with this stephen if you ever come across this comment coudos keep up the good work,comedy
saw this movie in chinese and loved it im not sure if americans will get all of the jokes because the subtitles are never as accurate as they should be im sorry to say i dont think stephen chows movies should be meant for an american audience there are a lot of chinese references that americans wont understand and they wont be able to appreciate the ingenuity of the plot as muchnonetheless i thought the parodies were hilarious and the martial arts again is superb this movie should not be advertised as a sequel to shaolin soccer because it really has no relation to it it is an enjoyable movie by itself,comedy
i saw this movie today at the talkcinema screening in northbrook illinois i absolutely loved it this is a clever entertaining movie made by someone who loves american movies every scene references some movie tv show or cartoon except that the film is a kung fu movie in chinesewith subtitles i recognized hilarious homages to touch of evil roadrunner the untouchables la confidential pulp fiction tex avery west side story and in my favorite sequence the shining i was the only person at this talkcinema showing who actually liked this movie please please please go see so stephen chow will make a ton of money and all those obnoxious sophisticates who insist that there is no audience for this movie will have to eat their words,comedy
what happens when chuck jones meets charlie chaplin in a bar in shanghai yea i think you know how this endsgong fu is an incredibly entertaining film that improves on all the conventions set in chows previous work shaolin soccer while at times it may feel like chow isnt quite sure which genre to stay in they tend to flesh themselves out with the wacky humour and great action sequences its rare that i can watch a film now and just be flatout entertained is made with so much love of the medium that its hard not to sit there and accept it in all its wackinessstephen chow is slowly developing himself in to this centurys tramp and i couldnt be happier,comedy
one of the best if not the best movies ive seen for a long time i must admit i was precarious in my approach about this film but what a blast yep there is some elements of other films in here but i wont put any spoilers ini reckon it was easy enough to followi cant express how good this film isimport it never mind wait for general releasesnobody and i mean nobody does these sort of films better than whence they camegreat special effects put to good use maybe overboard at times but not outlandish well directed well thought out piece of kung fu madnessfight scenes are well thought out and great to watchtheres even elements of video games hereu will notice them even done to the ying yang signs on the floor even done to the way people are sorted out shall we say mortal kombat springs to mind even good old street fighter moves in here a defiant blast for kung fu nutters like myselffinal word outstanding loved every minute of it,comedy
im not a much of martial arts fan though i have enjoyed a few now and thenbut i do love a fun film like this the action was excellent and fun to watch but it was the comedy that had me laughing out loud like i havent laughed in a long time dont be put off by having to watch this movie with subtitles once this film gets rolling you wont notice youre reading them  and it even somehow enhanced the humor of the film for me what a treat the animation of the musical fight scene the subtle jokes mixed in with the outright guffaws the playful use and satirizing of stereotypes from all the walks of life is so well done that id find it hard to believe anyone could watch this and not walk away almost tired of laughing,comedy
this movie proves stephen chow is no onehit wonder with shaolin soccer in this movie he paid tribute to old school hk kungfu movie with its comical style and music the movie is well pace and full of funny scenes and characters the only reason i didnt give it a ten for the rating is due to the fact that they used outdated cg in this film tho i dont blame them its not like theyre hollywood from what i can see stephen chow is just going to get better since he became director himself he has done what few comic actors has done by becoming the story teller and director as well as actor this movie deserves to be shown in america,comedy
ive watched this movie more times than i can count and i always come back to the very first fight scene in the movie where coolie catches the lit lighter mid air in tune with the music he then proceeds to demolish the axe gang members one by one while his brothers in arms join him in the fightwithout further knowledge one would think that these 3 and especially coolie was our main protagonists only later to find out this wasnt the caseeven though the movie takes lots of liberties when it comes to the laws of physics the movie still portrays accurate martial arts when it comes to fighting which i loveall in all i strongly encourage you to watch this movie and make and set an opinion of your own enjoy ,comedy
wow the best this director ever madevery creativelots of characters awesome soundtrackgood balance overallworth at least 8in my top 5 best fantasy kung fue wt comedy if not number 1,comedy
just seen it again with my whole family we all enjoyed the great action comedy from this masterpiece,comedy
21 august 2005 is one of those few movie that is able to capture the elements of various diverse movie genres and successfully balance them to produce a viable intact movie experience that an audience can relate to in the tradition of kill bill and crouching tiger hidden dragon brings together elements of the old martial arts movies the contemporary retro feel of drama and comedy in a way that singes the senses the blatant visceral murders and killings along with the slapstick comedy bounces the audience in a tumultuous emotional cosmic ride while the leading characters are both intriguing compelling but in their own ways despicable the eclectic use of special effects along with the uncertainty of who will live or die sets up the movie in a delicious way there were some disconcerting elements with a few scenes left hanging the jerky jump between scenes abrupt that left little time for the audience to react the tone of the movie shifted between the first third of confusion and disorientation and the last twothirds of the movie that required the audience to remold their perception where the separate threads seem to be tied together awkwardly as this was no mystery thriller or detective movie however overall was one of the best movies to come out in 2004,comedy
,comedy
this movie was an absolute blast to watch great characters storyline and effects a must watch peeps,comedy
i could watch this all day and never get sick of it one of the classics eversuper creative and intense but still funny,comedy
kungfu hustle one of the more satrical takes on chinese martial arts not it only contains martial arts but comedy yet the movie strikes a balance between this comedy and seriousness of the movie and this was this balance of extremeites which made it more enjoyable for me too much comedy would reuin the dark story of the movie while too much seriousness would destroy the point of watching this satire overall the movie is nice would give it a 810 being a statrical film this movie aims to critize the actions of the axe gang however at the start of the film it exemplifies the axe gangs brutality as they killed a rival gang of mobsters but at the introduction of our main protagonists and the arrival of the martial artists come to mock the idea of the axe gang are untouchable with the martial artists to distrupt thier deeds they now turn to bounty hunters and mr beast to silence these challengers however at the end of the movie their whole position in social hierarchy is distrupted by their own descions to intervene in such a petty residential block,comedy
satirical to classic or western action filmshardly knows where it is goingshift of characters hard to connectstill funny confusingsuperpower cgi cartooni despite being a lover of films with strong messages and deep disturbing themes still enjoyed having to watch i know this because even if this happened to be the fourth time i have watched it i still found myself laughing and enjoying its many comedic elements and shallow jokes though the movie in itself is quite simple such that it did not choose to delve into deeper themes and symbolisms but made use of slapstick comedy as well as the idiocy of the characters as a means to tell a story that captivates the audiences attention through a constant flow of comic relief not much thinking and analysis is needed by the audience to understand and appreciate the movie thus even the most shallow moviegoers could be won over by the charm and the appeal of this film at the same time if one were to observe how the director chose to present the film he or she did not go for the approach of being realistic but mainly used their strength of going all out to make the film fiction this is highly evident in how cgi was used to overexaggerate blows facial expressions features deaths fightscenes and transitions they even gave characters superpowers to make normal traditional chinese kungfu action scenes more appealing to western audience with all these together it does not only create the definition of comedy in both aspects of vfx sfx and their characters but the overall lighthearted atmosphere it gives off even in dramatic scenes is extremely entertaining altogether earning around 67 stars in my opinionbut it is also this innocent vibe which hides a greater satire to what the entire movie actually chooses to mock upon observing the film one could notice that the film hardly knew where it was going even to myself i felt the abrupt shift of characters and scenes far too confusing to be fully invested into the storyline in one segment we see the axe gang terrorizing the locals in another the conflict between the residents of pig sty and later on randomly the main character shows up with a backstory and thus commences a standard heros journey plotline the flow of the movie could have been more organized but from this observation i learned to see how this film chose to use satire and its jumbled up plotline to mimic and criticize the the nature of western media films having to start with the main character he deviates from the standard story of a asian heros film from other movies by stripping his or her motivation of doing justice based on the commonly darker themes ex revenge honor etc found in many eastern literature or films instead we see the common western ideals of being strongest in the hierarchy of power shown by the competition amongst kung fu masters to be the best in the martial arts the beast leung siulung bowing to sing sing wanting to feel powerful or selfconfident by joining the axe gang due to a traumatic experience of being overpowered by bullies etc this western idea of power is repeated all throughout a film and there is a rivalry between the characters to be on top at the same time there are also many factors that were added in the film to further appeal to the taste of western audiences these include such usages of cgi which was not common in chinese films produced in the years around when was made there were the use of superpowers and superhuman abilities that brought taste to the overly used handtohand combat which the chinese have been so used in incorporating in their action films and may look quite bland in the eyes of the west lastly the director tried to fit as much stories and events possible in the span of the 1 hour and 40 minute film because it took at movie quite a long time before the main character was introduced it was evident of how rushed the character development of sing was all at once we get the memory of how sing tried to defend fong before one knows it he gets beaten to a pulp gains a mentor landlady and landlord becomes the supreme master of kung fu and returns back to a normal life pursuing a humble goal of love altogether this shows a clear resemblance to the heros journey a patterned plotline that is commonly used in movies such as those created by marvel dc and western action movies all of which are generally accepted by the public i believe that this way of presenting the movie in a comedic crammed and shallow fashion was all intentional in having to criticize western films today the director made use of many tropes clich events and comedic elements that are taken from western genres to further enhance the appeal of this asian chinese film even to foreigners it gave taste to ordinary chinese films but also was satirical in order to exaggerate the western qualities it shared this was even done to the other works of stephen chow such as shaolin soccer or journey to the west conquering the demons this strategy at the end was successful as it not only opened the minds for people to give more attention to the films created by the east but also helped him garner around 78 stars to many of his works,comedy
i never got the chance to watch this movie and have been wanting to do so im very happy with my decision to finally take the time to see what ive been missing the blend of action and comedy is spot on as some people have already said the ending is of course predictable but this will not hinder you from enjoying the film nevertheless stephen chow is a very talented director and storyteller and never takes himself too seriously if you wanted to watch an entertaining movie that will take your mind off of your troubles for a little while give this awesome gem an hour and thirty minutes of your life and i promise you wont regret it,comedy
although the 3d effects are real bad this feature shines in unconventional places the characters are quirky and lovable except for stephen chows the humor is enjoyable and some shots are surprisingly ambitious a film with a lot of care put into it,comedy
is a comedic triumph the high point of actordirector stephen chows career over the decades before the international hit he spent years refining his trade as the wacky roughlyhewn rascal with just the right amount of gold in his heart chow plays the bad guy well enough a bit of stubble ragged sleeves rolled up and just a hint of manic crazy in those eyes when he brandishes his little pocket knife that suggests hell do anything to make it big in this uncaring world his goal is to ascend to the top of the criminal underworld and join the ranks of the legendary axe gang  and chows opening scene is a testament to the sort of style and status that he admires the word here is cool the top hats the black suits the jazz backing the sashay of brother sum as he approaches another victim think the goofy kkk clansmen in the coens o brother where art thou only without the uncomfortable historical baggage chow blends touches of class the slow pull out from within the police headquarters the inhabitants frozen in fear realistic grit black and white newspaper headlines documenting their reign of terror in 1930s china and pure chopsocky fun the operatic ridiculousness in the slow motion axe taking off a leg effortlessly but while the cities are under constant fear the slums of pig sty alley live so sloppily they are practically immune from all the outside whizbang the setting is built up like an old style hollywood set on the studio backlot a towering structure with a life of its own reminiscent of that in irma la douce or rear window we find the beating heart of a community that becomes a character in itself  here money is immaterial luxury is a foreign language and its petty squabbles are only surface conflict chow riffs off traditional wuxia stories by plucking legendary heroes out of the ordinary village fabric martial arts masters for one day and then back to their modest living even with the buddhiststeeped redemption arc of his own character sing its clear that chow is attempting to undo some of the mythos surrounding these action figures they fight out of sheer necessity to protect those who cant but in the meantime theyre tailors and cooks and labourers the story is the proof that sing needs to see that good guys can come from any walk of life whereas ambition without restraint can often lead one down darker pathschows always had a penchant for goofy unrestricted action with liberal use of wirework that doubles as slapstick comedy flirting scholar comes to mind he would hit his creative peak with in which a quaint village becomes the arena for an increasingly zany series of martial arts battles the set design is there to be a battered and collapsible playground walls crack with relish and stone banisters go flying in bits so regularly its surprising there are any stairs left by the end of the film chow enlisted the best to choreograph his fighting sequences among them kung fu royalty in yuen wooping who brings the same rapid weightless intensity that the wachowskis asked for in the matrix his sequences verge on the edge of realism as if real life had merged with a cartoon elsewhere theres more of the same slapstick in the way that cgi and sound design lift the live action motion with puffs of dust trails legs whipping up into a blur and axe gang cronies dropping like flies from up above and splattering onto the ground hear sing rack up hits like an arcade game in the climatic melee and the machine gun rattle of the toes broken by his fast feet and listen to how the traditional chinese instrumentation like erhu and the guzheng build to thrilling crescendos and in one scene become the actual weapon in a stylised martial arts showdown its not every movie that has slapstick and pathos all rolled into one and leaves us satisfied by the end that the protagonist has come of age and finally realised his place in the world this is broad stuff but chow has always excelled at the scruffy everyman the rascal and although i mention he plays the bad guy well enough hes not good enough for a pure villain he doesnt have that snarl or the complete mean streak there has always been good in him theres nothing in those cheap manuals worth a damn but its what inside that counts and in the final scene where the camera swings around and takes us back into the past we once again glimpse the little boy who believed he could save the world,comedy
this action comedy from hong kong is set in the thirties and gangs particularly the axe gang dominate usually such gangs ignore the poor as they have nothing worth stealing and no money to extort that changes when two wannabe gangsters sing and his friend bone start trying to intimidate the poor inhabitants of pig sty alley while claiming to be members of the axe gang it is immediately obvious that they have picked on the wrong neighbourhood and they are chased off soon the real axe gang turn up hoping repair damage to their reputation they dont know there are many old martial arts masters living there and they too are beaten after that they bring in assassins including the beast reportedly the most dangerous man in the world by now sing is with the gang but will he remain with them or will he become the protector of the helpless he dreamt of being as a childif you like your kung fu action to feel at least a little bit realistic you might be disappointed but if you want a good laugh and really overthetop action then this film is a delight the action is a mix of standard slightly exaggerated martial arts kung fu that is more like a superpower and a ridiculously sped up chase the characters are a lot of fun most notably the landlady and her husband sing and the beast the cast does a solid job the situations may be comic and the characters over the top but they are played straighter than one might expect most of the comedy worked for me although i must admit the speeded up chase was a little too silly for my taste there are also quite a few references to other films such as the shining and the matrix overall id certainly recommend this to anybody who likes good slapstick comedy combined with exciting martial arts action,comedy
creative wellchoreographed and funny by chinesecantonese director stephen chow was an international 100 million hitthe pros the pace and charm of the movie the homage it makes to older martial arts flicks the stylish and nicelooking scenes its composed bythe cons its not quite enough a story in itself to make me fully engaged rather its a collection of nice pictures and fighting scenes,comedy
a vicious axewielding chinese gang attempts to intimidate the working class residents of a housing complex but are unprepared for the kung fu skills of not only the residents but their sullen landlord and landlady in this offbeat action comedy not only is the fight choreography impressive the battles become more insane in the best possible way as the movie progresses with mindblowing special effects as all concerned perform stunts as if they are keanu reeves in the matrix it is an incredibly funny film too with the best moments had by a deadpan qiu yuen as the nononsense landlady with a gift for speed not all of the humour works with some silly stereotype supporting characters but there is a lot of fun to be had in the wannabe gangster character that director stephen chow has written for himself comically stabbed multiple times by his own knives at one point  throw in a fun reference to the shining and camerawork that never sits stills and this is a pretty appealing concoction the character arc of chows character leaves a little to be desired but this a film in which the images reign supreme over the story there is a delightful weirdness to all the axewielding gang members running about in top hats and tuxedossuits and qiu yens kung fu powers turn her into the very epitome of a moody landlady who you dont want to mess with,comedy
this film is all over the place but even if you are just a film buff with no interest in kung fu films this is worth a watch with tons of references and homages to other movies from fred and ginger to bruce lee and from the shining to the matrix its kind of fun just to look for themit has both comedy and serious elements but you have to look fast for them because this movie is fairly relentless with the action this has a huge budget for a chinese kung fu film too and you can see right where it goes because there is cgi mayhem aplenty and that leads to the only group of filmgoers who will not enjoy at all those who do not like action films this is not a real talky film and seems to let the action do most of the talking for it you might not like it but it never gives you much of a chance to get bored,comedy
from the creators of shaolin soccer comes another rollicking roisterous  batshit crazy feature that presents its filmmaker in tremendous form brings more craziness to the screen than his previous effort  packs a ridiculous yet riveting premise that brims with genuine warmth to finish as one of the zaniest examples of its genretells the story of a wannabe gangster who aspires to join the most notorious gang in the city but when he  his friend stumble into a slum ruled by eccentric landlords their action eventually leads to an allout war between the slumlords who are kung fu masters in disguise and the very gang he hopes to be a part ofcowritten coproduced  directed by stephen chow brims with all the ingredients that made his previous work an instant classic and this time delivers a far more absurd  comical tale the action segments are extremely outlandish  nonsensical but also incessantly fun  joy to watch thanks to its cartoonish visualslike before chow manages to add a subplot that forms the emotional core of the story and it stays constant even when everything around it is pushing out of orbit its exaggerated moments of action are surprisingly captivating even if you burst out laughing the next moment and its entire cast chips in with hilarious performances to bring their oddball characters to lifeon an overall scale is another crazy weird  eccentric comedy thats filled with idiosyncratic characters is jampacked with overthetop moments and is another winning material from stephen chow a wild rambunctious  demented rollercoaster ride thats enjoyable entertaining  unexpectedly gratifying is an action comedy of maddening proportions,comedy
is stephen chows comedic followup to shaolin soccer and enjoyed a massive success around the world on first release im sorry to say that i didnt enjoy it as much as shaolin soccer this is a slightly weaker film with an overreliance on silly cgi effects and a sometimes boring meandering plot line that refuses to give the viewer any character to really root for this time around chow  who directed as well as acted  is an unappealing lowlife criminal for most of the plot before turning into an obvious neo impersonator for the climax which heavily rips off the matrix reloadedunlike shaolin soccer there are no obvious good guys or bad guys instead most of the characters are ruthless or selfish or get what they deserve chow is unlikeable his fat buddy barely gets a look in and while the kung fufighting landlady is supposed to be a character that viewers love and find hilarious im afraid she didnt impress me for a second better is yuen wah better known as the baddie in dragons forever enjoying a fine new taste of cinematic success after languishing in the doldrums for a decade wah who doesnt seem to have aged at all since his bad guy days is a brilliant fighter and a good actor to boot and i wish he had more screen timeelements of the film are obvious from shaolin soccer  indeed some of them havent changed at all like the tackedon romance with the mute girl theres also a ton of the special effects work we saw in the football flick except its not novel here anymore and its overused throughout when most of the fight scenes rely on crazy effects you know youre in trouble pretty much all the attempts at humour fall flat  watching characters race at impossible speeds through the countryside like theyre in a disney cartoon just doesnt work for me the script is limited and the fact that there are too many different characters means its impossible to focus your attention on any one bit instead this is a mishmash of old jokes new tricks and one too many matrix jokes which dont really seem to understand what parody means  simply repeating scenes we saw in the hollywood blockbusters isnt funnythe other good thing in the film  aside from yuen wah  is the bad guy the beast played by siulung leung better known as the 70s bruce lee impersonator bruce liang who appeared in the likes of magnificent bodyguards leung  who hasnt acted in twenty years  has a ball as the supreme bad guy and hes impossible to dislike elsewhere while the plethora of fight scenes are always entertaining making this a film to be enjoyed despite the myriad flaws,comedy
good almost everything i love it all from the crazy slapstick humor to the wild kungfu fantasy fighting to the insane villains and incredible heroes stephen chow is not a man who does things by halves when he does things he does it all the way is physical evidence of this is not a film for the meek everything about it is completely over the top from the beginning where a mans leg is sliced clean in two by an axe to the end a kungfu style called the toad which emulates the croaking and hopping of its namesake another amazing aspect is the soundtrack inspired by classic shaolin music its incredibly fitting to the scenes in this movie i actually went out of my way to find the soundtrack to listen by itself the special effects are a bit too much but thats just part of its charm and humor this is my favorite movie of all time in terms of sheer entertainment ive watched it 4 times alreadybad character development the protagonist sing isnt a hero until 34ths of the movie is through and for no apparent reason or explanation other than the lollipop the landlady and landlord are also cowards until the movie is halfway through also for no apparent reasonverdict i highly recommend watching this movie at least once or twice or thrice or four times like i did,comedy
ive seen all of stephens movies all of the 1990s one are his funniest movies but is what his heart truly wants all of those people who said that he did not put his heart into making this movie are basically shallow all of his ridiculous comedy movies were not written by him he just acted because he liked acting not because he liked the plots that those writers wrote he wanted to earn enough money so that he could make his own movies which reflected what he truly loved he loves and respects kung fu this is the reason why did not include lots of funny scenes like other movies that he starred in he wanted to focus more on kung fu and less on slapstick i respect stephen chow for what he has done this movie totally got me it teaches me that being the strongest means being able to inspire others asian movie cannot surpass western movie in term of cgi but it definitely has more meaningful lessons that the audience can learn from,comedy
is pretty much what youd get if you took the most outlandish martial arts anime and turned it into a live action movie and it is amazing everyone and i mean everyone knows kung fu the stunts and powers get crazier and crazier with each fight the bad guys are sleek beyond believe the good guys are humble and hardworking the music accompanies everything perfectly and luckily the special effects can keep up with all this madnesswhat really makes this film work though is the fact that it doesnt take itself too seriously its a comedy at its heart gently mocking and parodying the kung fu movies and anime series that have so clearly inspired it yet at the same time it pays homage to them it respects its genre and it shows but in the end its here to have some fun which is great because itd be so easy for a movie such as this to be unbearable if it tried to have you buy all of its outlandishness as a straight up actionthe actors are also very talented beautifully straddling the line of being just badass enough to be taken seriously and still lighthearted enough to garner the laughs needed special mention to stephen chow as sing the cowardly main character and qiu yuen as the frumpy landlady that holds the whole block in terror under her dainty slipper shoeis over the top its ridiculous its loud and bombastic its unbelievable its funny and groaninducing and for what it is its absolutely perfect,comedy
is about a man who dreams of being a ruthless gang member in his childhood he tried to be good by trying to help a deaf girl he quickly learned though that good guys never win in a world where evil triumphs as hard as he tries he has no aptitude in evil he finds his calling turns on the bad guys and with his power delivers justicethe fighting scenes and special effects are the highlight of this movie but there are times when chow seems to overdo the computer effects the film has a unique humor and doesnt take itself too seriously even when women get shot and people get hacked to death the film maintains an upbeat tonewhen the main character sing gives up on morality it mirrors the way many people grow up lose their innocence and compromise their morals for the sake of amassing power and wealth,comedy
sing and his good buddy really want to join the citys main gang  the axe gang their only problem is that they are a pair of bumbling guys that cant do anything gangrelated but they decide that at least they can pretend to be in the gang which leads to them being confronted by the real gangwho would have ever thought that a thin plot line and extensive special effects could actually make a good movie stephen chow must have figured that problem out and my best guess as to what he did here was just add some good humor and stir in addition to the fact that the special effects are very imaginative but even this alone often makes bad movies but once again there is plenty of wacky humor here all the best comic timing anyone can remember from watching cartoons in elementary school is here in good doses a chase scene as as our hero sing escapes from an angry landlady is reminiscent of the roadrunner and wile e coyote cartoon and it is positively hilarious the stylized comic extravaganza gets only better from therethe film also critically spares the viewer excess there is plenty of action and lots of obvious computer effects but nothing is really overdone as is typical of many hollywood movies the action and special effects dont seem reused throughout the movie each stunteffect is given just enough screen time to be enjoyed but then something new is shown a scene where two musicians fight two ninja masters really shows this  nothing is repeated in that scene each attackfight movestunt real or magical is always fresh the scene is one of the most inventive fight scenes ever and a good high point in inventiveness and special effects use  810rated r kind of unfairly for mainly comic violence and cartoonish mayhem,comedy
this movie is a pure fun ride it doesnt take itself seriously and stays true to that throughout so dont watch the movie if you want a movie with a philosophical background you will be disappointed for nothing although it is an eastern movie it does also resemble a hollywood kind of flair as well the special effects the thin characters and so fourth or some innuendos or homages if you will like a scene that will have road runnerwile e coyote fans on their toes of course there is much more here than that and the other comic likeness you get here could also be a mangaanime similarity and i wouldnt be surprised if the whole thing was based on a manga japanese comic book editors note to be true o,comedy
would be a definite favorite of those who like highfantasy movies the movie is very hilarious being a parody and action packed the stunts go beyond our imagination can you ever imagine someone using a buddhas palm as a deadly weapon sequences like these would be liked by many wushu loversfun is when we see the most ordinary of the people turning out to be real kungfu mastersthe story is about a wannabe kungfu maestro who uses up his pocket money saved to become a lawyer to purchase a kungfu book from a street vendor he puts in a sincere effort to learn the technique from the book but is unable to learn the art his hardships as a child makes him lose faith in being a good citizen and so he wants to become bad he tries to join the axegang which is the most notorious gang in that locality in order to impress the leader of the gang he is asked to secure a kungfu master called beast from the prison beast is being brought by the axegang as they fail to destroy the people in a particular housingcomplex who insult the gang the landlady of the complex and her husband are also kungfu masters but we come to know about it only during the middle of the movie all the fight sequences are interspersed with a lot of humor all in all a great movie to watch for the entire family,comedy
i was blown away seeing this movie i rented it without any expectations you should also probably do that but the screenplay and the build up is great the music and special effects are top notch the land lord and land lady have done great not to mention the axe gang boss and his side kicki particularly enjoyed the sequence where the musicians use the musical instrument to fight the background score and the special effect combination in this sequence is great you should definitely appreciate the directors imagination in this sequence the movie is also very funny consider the comment by beast when he exclaims  i do not know lions roar could be done with the speakerthis is a great entertainer,comedy
this is a true kung fu movie i know therere a lot of kungfu movies out there but imo and thats coming from someone who read hundreds of kung fu novels multiple times this one finally got it right crouching tiger hidden dragon may have got the physical form right hero may have got the mood right house of flying daggers may have got the romance right but got the kung fu right or rather the wu xia right youll probably have to wikipedia the word  since it holds a lot of meanings the movie has some brilliant scenes with exquisite form and style like the three masters face the two musicians scene and toad fight scene however its the other parts that shows they truly understand kung fu like how the true masters would rather live in pig sty alley than going out showing the world what theyre good at how a boy with humble backgrounds can eventually become the best martial artist and especially the ending when the beast asks what is the name of your technique and he answers you want to learn i will teach you that is a very taoist thing to say just that one line could win me over kung fu may seem like its about fighting and winning but actually its also about teaching preserving and spreading and in kung fu tradition the latter may be more important than the former mortal enemies dont have to stay as enemies they are really on the same side in the pursuit of great martial art provided they no longer run around trying to kill people its an art form first fighting skill second what impressed me most is they delivered this rather serious topic in a simple fun and cool way i highly recommend this movie,comedy
stephen chow has been a thorn in the side of hong kong critics for more than a decade now  his main claim to fame is his ability to resurrect cantonese comedy in the era of the increased sophistication of the hong kong new wave cantonese comedy is a style of low slapstick  benny hill is a good western equivalent  lots of lockerroom humor and farting in chow has managed to increase his general level of sophistication and at the same time use computer graphics to construct a film that is totally fantasy i found it amusing fu purists will object that there is naught but wireworks in the fight sequences but this isnt really a kung fu film its really a comic fantasy similar to mel brooks blazing saddles in the lightness with which it treats its subjects not for all tastes but as i am hardly a chow fan i think the fact that even soeone who doesnt like chows brand of comedy could like this film says something positive about italso there are enough references to classic fu films to satisfy the purists  as long as theyre looking for a comedy and not a fu filmlook the special fx are good and its a funny film really grows on you with repeated viewings,comedy
fun moviereally goofy and silly but thats what theyre trying for so no complaints the actor who played beast the old evil master with a wife beater tee shirt is an oldie but goody i remember watching him in some of the old kung fu movies from the late 70s and early 80s he was obviously a lot younger then if you like this guy then check out my kung fu 12 kicks or iron fingersthe rest of the cast was fun it almost seemed as if they were poking gentle fun at the old shaw brothers kung fu movies with a bit of modern day lingo mixed in for good measure if youre in the mood for a funny combination of matrix five deadly venoms and bugs bunny then this one might be a winner,comedy
this movie is really cool the basic plot involves a guy stephen chow who wants to get into the axe gang in circa 1930 shanghai by impressing them with how much of an arch criminal he is he decides to pick on an apartment block inhabited by the working poor and triggers a massive confrontation between the landlady of the block and the working poor on one side and the axe gang and their hired thugs on the other both sides turn out to be more than they seem and the confrontation quickly escalates into a battle filled with chinese magic and fighting artswah yuen steals the show as the ironfisted landlady marching around in a silk house robe hair in curlers puffing away on her ever present cigarette while shouting orders really a fun fun movie to watchmy only complaint is that some of it is a little hard to follow and i would blame that on the translation the movie was made in chinese and i generally watch foreign language films with the subtitles rather than dubbed because i like to hear the way the actors sound when they are saying something while i read the subtitle but the subtitles didnt quite seem right so i switched to the dubbed version and that didnt seem quite right either so i watched it dubbed with the subtitles and half the time the dubbed spoken english didnt agree with the english subtitles so a really crappy job of translation makes this a 9 instead of a tenother than that the acting the visual effects the camera work the choreography the comedy the story are all first rate and make for a spectacular show,comedy
i am no big kungfu movie fan but this really doesnt matter as this is not a kungfu movie  at least not in the sense that hero or the tiger and the dragon were this movie is pure joy and the kungfu setting is merely incidental i watched this movie on the plane and it was so much fun that i think i kept the other people in my row awake because i was laughing aloud the whole time the gags are very well made the whole tone of the film is very tongue in cheek but absolutely not pretentious and although the humor is unpretentious and very visual it is by no means slapstick there are clear goodnatured references to other recent movies but this movie is not a parody or a satire in fact i find it hard to classify this movie it is neither highbrow nor lowbrow it is neither steve martin nor leslie nielsen this is john candy and steve martin together as in planes trains and automobiles with action scenes directed by james cameron it is one of the funniest action movies i have ever watched i highly recommend it to goodnatured funloving people i would watch it again over and over i believe this is going to become a cult movie in the future it is utterly original intelligent and lovingly made,comedy
stephen chow eh i was to be convinced having read so many good reviews of shaolin soccer i got the dvd what a disappointment i thought it was terrible not funny not enough football and terrible special effects how surprised was i when a friend convinced me to get on dvd expecting it to be rubbish i sat cynically money wasted what a surprise  funny and entertaining the kung fu was spectacular the bad guys interesting the fights were masterful  i have been convertedfantastic  maybe this stephen chow has some talent after allan entertaining couple of hours 810,comedy
this stylized kung fu kicker by stephen chow shaolin soccer features chow as a hapless gangster wannabe who seems to be unlucky in any endeavor or scheme that his warped mind can come up with he aspires to join the axe gang a notorious syndicate making a move on a local neighborhood but the crazy tenants have a bit of kung fu magic up their sleevesis a wildly imaginative and engaging actioncomedy whether knocking you dead with its slapstick comedy or making your ryes bugout with its amazing highly energetic action sequences hustle will surely please anyone fond of this brand of film most of the sequences must be seen to be believed the outlandish visual style makes for many exciting sequences i almost passed this one up due to poor trailers but am really glad i gave it a shot is a really fun flick,comedy
kung fu movies are inherently ridiculous with their balletic indulgences this movie exploits that constant over the top action with slapstick and looney tunes gags i laughed out loud during the husband beating the inept knife throwing the road runner chase and the pinball battle scenes everybody knows some kung fu from the frumpy landlady and her wussy man to the beast who looks more like a florida resident than a master but like all great comedies this movie pays tribute to the same movies it jabs at the fight scenes in this movie are better than any american knockoff the special effects and sound effects are quite good because action needs sound and those stylish snapping noises are here whenever anyone is hit this belongs in the same class as the princess bride and shaun of the dead,comedy
im bill springer and heres my final thoughti wanted to see this in the theaters like really bad but im poor in the fact this economy sucks and my parents hate me enough to not give a crap about me seeking entertainment at the cost of 850 soooo long story short im raking in the cash now and i bought the dvdalright my expectations were greatly exceeded it is a perfect mesh of kung fu comedy and it even threw in a back story or twoa purpose which is always good just imagine this dragonball zminus the the shiny kamehamehas mixed with and gang related movie wrapped in a loony tunesque shell thingy its worth the buy if your into the whole being entertained thing i know who in the world would want to be entertainedsarcasm now go to sleep right now or im taking away your toys and giving them to the boogyman in your closet sweet dreams,comedy
kungfu hustle where to begin well for starters actor and director stephen chow is quickly becoming one of asias most beloved screen comedians at 42 and already a veteran of numerous comedies chow finally broke through to american audiences with shaolin soccer in 2001 now he brings forth this comedic vehicle kungfu hustlethis movie has it all slapstick comedy thats right out of a looney tunes short martial arts and dazzling spinkicks and armtwists that are all courtesy of yuen wo ping the matrix crouching tiger hidden dragon in this picture which is set in 1940s shanghai china before the revolution chow stars as sing an aspiring gangster who wishes to join the notoriously lethal axe gang the axe gang rules much of the citys underground with an iron fist and their demands are absolute but the accidentprone sing and his chubby companion played by chi chung lam wander into pig sty alley posing as axe gang members the axe gang doesnt bother with this slum very much because its so poor and plus its already under the tyranny of the vicious chainsmoking landlady qiu yuen who runs things along with her husband landlord wah yuenthings become complicated when the real axe gang shows up and the gang is attacked by a trio of kungfu masters who had been living there the axe gang members are quickly defeated in the ensuing chaos while sing and his companion are captured by the fleeing gangsters the two are allowed to join but are demanded a deed of loyalty  kill someone for the next 45 minutes or so chow is off the screen and we focus mostly on the tenants of pig sty alley as the kungfu masters square off in dazzling skirmishes with axe gang acolytes who are masters themselves landlady and landlord are also later revealed to be masters toochow reenters the picture and remains on the screen until the closing credits where he donning a white outfit a la bruce lee himself takes on the remaining gangsters in a freeforall reminiscent of the crazy 88s scene from kill bill as it turns out he is a kungfu genius in that hes had the power to master martial arts since birth i must say chow does display some impressive moves of his own he then does battle in the films most overthetop sequence with the beast hsiao liang who is the most feared kungfu master of them allthis is a brilliant actioncomedy from a mind that seemed destined to bring forth something like this to the masses the film plays out a lot like a collision between every great martial arts movie weve ever seen and then adds a heavy dose of slapstick and chows sly wit youll laugh at chows comedic antics as every great kungfu flick gets its fair share of comedy its just kind of funny since i was watching enter the dragon 1973 last night which is considered the greatest martial arts movie ever and then today i watch kungfu hustle which could be called one of the greatest parodies of the genrethough some of the humor might be lost on american audiences i found myself laughing quite a bit it definitely caught on to me as chow also pays sly homage to his heroes both bruce lee and jackie chan who made the genres chow pays respect to its all done in a deliriously comic fashion that also doubles as a visual feast for the eyes the film also contains a rather touching subplot with a mute girl sing once saved from bullies and it really got to me because of the cheesy music that cues up whenever they are on the screen togetherkungfu hustle is one of the best pictures ive seen this year so far i expect well see a lot more of these types of pictures that are going to be cherished by a devoted following in the future stephen chow has crafted a funny brash and actionpacked picture thats sure to remain with the masses in the coming years1010,comedy
its somewhat difficult to regard this film as a black comedy so to speak since the humor is far too light and abundant however in it very little are some rather serious and touching moments steven chow does a fine job of directing and manages to make this hodgepodge of looney tunes humor added with a touch of tarantino and matrix work in addition he plays the part as sing  the neerdowell who finds his calling but wah yuen and qiu yuen steal the show the action and laughs are aplenty disregard the films defiance for the law of physics just sit back and enjoy what may be one of our finest in quite some timetruly a gem how i wish it would have found its audience,comedy
hilarious plot i really dig stephen chows sense of humor this movie has matrixs special effects but with lot more funny scenes it might appear a little stupid if you are new to stephen chows style but no worries once you get a hang of his dark humor you will really enjoy it after all he is ranked way up there in hong kong entertainment arena along with jackie chen and jet li as far as popularity and gross income are concerned i enjoyed this movie a lot more than house of flying daggers which is a little confusing and characters motives are unclear this movie however makes everybodys intentions every clear it just makes you anxious to find out who is gonna kick whose ass in the end i also like the love story briefly intertwined with the action scenes the quick flashback of stephen chows character wins you on his side at early stage of the movie so that you like his character despite of all the bad things he does it especially makes you feel good when you see him kicking someone elses ass for a change in conclusion i love the movie i guess i better clean up my dvd shelf and find a spot for a new member of my collections,comedy
its a whole new set a whole new look at a movie a whole new genrei dont think its action adventure or comedy no it has its own genreand damn did i liked it  10 superior no more to say if u like jackie chan jet li and u expect that this is the same kind of movie youre wrongit contains everything that u wouldnt expect in the beginning you would think damn what a strange movie and you will laugh at the scenes but at the end it will make you think like what a masterpiece,comedy
the last few years have seen many excellent chinese movies ranging from historical dramas as in the emperor and the assassin to brilliant action movies hero house of flying daggers comedies like shaolin soccer thrillers like infernal affairs and moreis the next step of what i consider the growing up of the chinese film industry gong fu is an action film full of some of the finest martial arts you can find but it does not stop there latest cgi and cinematic effects are deployed with ease to make the experience truly magnificent this part could describe a well made but typical hollywood action production but gong fu grows beyond that incorporating very satirical elements that make this movie a treat if you are a fan of kung fu movies or if you are a critic this film can entice both as it presents a delectable parody of the genre without taking itself too seriously in so far it accomplishes what hollywood has lost somewhere along the way the ability to make a funny and inventive movie that is filled with little thoughtful vignettes to discover while still appealing to a broad publicthere are scenes which are so overdrawn that they become surreal moments when you can not believe what is happening on screen typical clichs like bad synchronization so common in past chinese movies are delightfully played upon in parts of the movie i was even reminded of scenes from dragonball z and other anime but underneath it all gong fu does not hide its social critique and puts the finger on several points that might hurt if you think about themoverall this is a movie for nearly everyone providing gags and entertainment if you just want to relax and little hints and thoughts to contemplate if you are of the thoughtful persuasion in my opinion it is one of this years top movies recommended,comedy
right from the start i was under pressure to like it the cast the director and everything thats already been said not to mention that its an asian film and im a huge fan the other reason i was under pressure was that my girlfriend loves the sun and this was the hottest day weve had in edinburgh all year it was the peak of a hot week and she let me take her inside to a movie an asian movie no less the cinema was empty the two of us and the projectionist  although it was all digital so who knows if someone was there and when the movie began i just wasnt surethe movie opens strong with a wonderful mix of visual styles and periods the sets give the feel of a western and the gang clothes give the impression of 50s america with the police looking just like police today these opening scenes are pretty strong loud and violent and so my expectations were whipped in the opposite direction as an axe murder and shooting rivet you to the spot thats when the dance number begins and youre whipped in another direction nervous laughter ensuesi think that paragraph defines the film quite well not that you really can define it but if you imagine genres and styles as straight lines traditional movies will pick one at the start and pretty much stick to it yes it might flip back and forth from its neighbour but what it wont do is weave a crisscross path back and forth between them all thats what appears to do it grabs from different styles genres and movies and pulls them together in a rich weave of a movie something youre not really used toafter that the movie comes to the current period and begins the story in earnest the laughs start from the beginning but to be honest we were still reeling from the opening and being thrown back and forth at this point i wasnt sure whether i was laughing because i thought i should be or because it really was funny i didnt know what mode or genre i was supposed to be inwhat quickly happens though is that you forget that standard youve been conditioned to expect by those endless reams of movies youve watched and suddenly out of nowhere youre enjoying the ride then you really do start laughingafter all i would really describe this as a comedy but it also brings you some amazing kung fu mixed with hollywood blockbuster effects a smidgen of a love story and a tiny bit of thriller its also a huge tale of good and evil and what it does take to be truly one or the other yeah but its still a comedy and one that pokes a finger at hollywood in the processmost of the humour is bizarre and off the wall and im not sure thats entirely down to the culture difference i wonder if even asian viewers would be feeling some of what we did during the early parts of the movie however it works it really does it grabbed me and made me laugh and i was often laughing at the movie itself and not the storythe story is great fun and its a massive story at that not just some small tale but an epic this is as the young boy is told about saving the world its that big with that im afraid thats all im going to say if you want more on the story read someone elses review and have it all given away or go and see the movie and revel in the first time viewingthe fight sequences are something else theyve done an amazing job to make the fights so seamless and to be able to visualise the effects during the choreography the fight scenes coupled with the stylistic effects they provide some breathtaking scenes all fantastically choreographed by sammo hung kambo and managing to keep a good feeling of fun throughoutapart from being surprised by the scale of the movie the huge effects and the excellent fight sequences the acting was pretty damn amazing and not just from one or two of the actors but from everyone not one of the actors stood out as being out of place and not a single one seemed to be dwarfed off the screen by the sheer number of actors around them i have to say that my favourite is the camp kung fu master the way he slipped from complete mastery of kung fu and strength of body and mind to his camp character running around the set was superbly entertainingstephen chow is totally natural in his role and plays both sides of his character extremely well never mind the fact that he cowrote directed and coproduced too hes pulled out a stunning performance with an amazing moviereally i dont think i can find any fault with this movie because there is so much to it i could keep writing about it and praising each individual element actors effects story but the beauty of this movie is that it is so much all at once its that rich weave of so many styles and genres that i already mentioned think of it as a beautiful dress you cant dissect it and being to critique the individual strands of the weave you loose the beauty of the dress and of seeing it being wornif that sounds cryptic its supposed to i cant give you anymore than that you just have to take my word for it that this is a stunningly good movie for so many different reasons relax let it flip you around and enjoy,comedy
i can say this was one of the best movies i have ever seen the most amazing thing of this movie is originality a great sense of humor wonderful kungfu scenes comedy romance and hilarious fun it is something like killbillspidermanadamsandlerit is not a well known way of storytelling which gives you an unexpected way of having fun from a movie in these days that hollywood cinema is suffering from lack of original ideas these kind of independent movies will continue to nail us in our seatsall apart stephen chow is brilliant with his acting directing and writing he will fascinate us with more movies i thinka definite 10 out of 10,comedy
what a fantastic movie humour by the truck load brilliant direction and a well paced rendition of the good guys v bad guys genre the fighting scenes are the best ive seen since the original mortal kombat and throw in a great plot and youve just spent a great night at the movies i have to say though that living in scotland as i do mrs landlady reminds me all too easily of scottish women  and i mean that in the nicest possible way stephen chow was 42 when he made this film how on earth does he look so good he seems to be a special effect all to himselfgo see it  go rent it  you will be regally entertained,comedy
the most most seminal work to be put on screen in a while this shows why steven chow is the most popular director in hong kong the mixture of comedy and kung fu to extremely original and the acting is fine the story great the fights are impressive and original its silly and funny and bloody a quintine tarratino matrix road runner mixture that works the most entertaining film ive seen in years it should have done better at the box office but itll live forever on video its a gang war comedy kung fu underdog love story but it works and youll be entertained the physical comedy was the best ive seen recently there are subtitles but the film works fine in chinese,comedy
what can i say  is one of those films that made me laugh so much that i felt so tired through all the laughing that i had done  the humour in it was sharp enough to cheer anyone up  there are way too many scenes in this film that are too funny and you just basically have to watch them for yourself inorder to make up your mind  there is also a good blend of cgi related martial arts with a lot of bodies flying all about the place  and you got infamous mafia like gangsters in this film that look pretty cool  all in all an excellent film and i urge people to at least give it a try even if your not a huge fan of the martial arts or comedy genre  and well what can you say about stephon chows performance  well judging from this fine piece of work that hell be headed for big things  you ever killed anyone before  ,comedy
present movies are more about lifes lessons and the horrible consequences of war a reflection of the times we live in very few of them are actually meant to entertain us and even the few comedies out there have leaned more and more into scatological humor and innuendo leaving the young audiences with scarce options stephen chow has the right idea when it comes to movies is pure entertainment the fights are very well choreographed the humor is light and very physical everyone will get the jokes the drama is also light but very well accomplished you can cry if you want and to top it all the special effects are great it is advisable that you avoid watching it with very young kids but anyone 13 and above will enjoy it a lot watching this movie is bliss the amalgamation of genres works very well and the pacing is nearperfect with ups and downs at all the right moments if you want to spend a great weekend night gather some friends get some takeout food and watch this movie,comedy
being a huge fan of asian cinema i couldnt wait to get my peepers on this one  and it certainly doesnt disappointthe premise itself is simple yet poignant the backdrops and sets looked like something straight out of spirited away the action sequences are jawdropping and the special effects are gaspworthy at times  the final thirty minutes being of notethis is up there with films like hero and house of flying daggers  and even the most diehard world cinema atheist will have problems resisting this all in all another fine example of why eastern cinema is right back up there where it belongs  and long may it stay that waysuperb 87  10,comedy
wowwowstephen chowthis and shaolin soccer are the stuff dreams are made of truly magic if youve seen both these films and hated themkill yourself theres no hope left for you and your troubled soul if you havent seen em see them asapwowextraordinary collection of smackdownsveering like a drunken driver between naive sweetness and startling cruelty is infuriatingly erratic very very funny and occasionally just flatout insane chow who writes and directs must share credit with fight choreographers yuen woo ping and sammo hung together they have cooked up an extraordinary collection of smack downs culminating in a full scale tenement assault that makes a mockery of the matrix and kicks gangs of new york in the gonadsits not subtle and its not clever but it is fabulous  mark kermodes review for the bbc,comedy
often i watch films knowing little more about them than the title and whatever i can guess from that was just such a film i have to admit that for the first five minutes or so i was worried these first few minutes arent particularly funny designed to set the scene and show the audience how bad the axe gang isi figured it from those first minutes as a standard kungfu movie made on the cheap and thought i was looking forward to endless slappyfu style fights where the combatants beat on each other for twenty minutes at a time without hurting each other but i told myself it had to get betterboy what an understatement that turned out to be once the madness begins it doesnt stop most of the comedy is visual naturally in a subtitled movie but it just wont quit many of the scenes are so intricately involved that the comedy contained therein just increases in intensity as the scene unfolds examples include the knifethrowing scene and the lighterinthecar scene the comedy keeps at you in these scenes long after youre sure that no further humour can be wrung out of the moment yet chow manages to squeeze every last drop of laughter out of itanother item which just adds to the insanity is the cgi being honest the quality of it isnt that good with some notable exceptions such as the assassins musical swords and knights but that only adds to the fun plus it all goes by so rapidly that you often barely have time to notice it as cgi anywaytheres also some dodgy wirework on show but again it all adds to the surreal nature of the movie and the funfactori mentioned the subtitles earlier im not a great fan of them too often they distract from what is going on or flick past too quickly to read in some dialogue scenes here though im happy to say that theyve been done extremely well the translation is excellent and often the comments are funny in and of themselves similarly they never obscure or distract from the action in fact they add to the overall effect of the movie immeasurablyive tried to imagine what the film would be like dubbed but i cant see it being any better than the subtitled version if they ever do a dubbed version i hope they pay as much attention to the voice acting as they have to the subtitles or it could be a serious let downkungfu hustle is not easily described some of the early jackie chan movies are similar though without the cgi obviously but even they cant come close to the silliness on offer here its like some insane genetic splicing of kungfu benny hill and the matrixlets just say i havent been so thoroughly entertained by a film since the first time i watched airplane and i havent laughed so much for sure unlike that particular comedy film though i suspect the humour of kfh will last a lot better if you want to see what martial arts comedy should be like this is where its attheres little more i can say without ruining the scenes except to say go and see it dont be put off by the first few minutes and just enjoy,comedy
wowa this movie is awesome usually im not that enthusiastic when it comes to comedies i dont usually laugh at stupid jokes nor im easily entertained with comedy flicksbut this showed true potential so i decided to give it a shot and boy it delivered superb acting great script excellent cgi and just full of laughs i certainly deserves a spot at the top 10 movies of this year and probably in top 10 or 20 of all time comedies im not very familiar with the work of stephen chow but im a fan now see it if you dont think it was worth the money then just dont bother seeing any other movie  ever,comedy
stephen chow can easily be considered the next jacky chan and keanu reeves moreso as he wrote produced and directed this amazing laughfilled yet thoughtprovoking epic as a firsttimer a pretty dramatic feat heres hoping he can maintain the impetusi am still trying to figure out if the movie is set in the 30s just before ww2 or prior to the 50s after ww2 but i think that not knowing adds to the mystique the axe gang boss was hilarious as he was trying hard to talk like jimmy cagney and dance like fred astaire however as we say here in barbados he aint no sweetbread his mannerisms and affectations may be something to snicker at but not his cool and smoldering rage  like when he takes on the boss of the crocodile gang whose own influence was western flickssome of the humor may be lost on occidental audiences for instance it may seem a joke  but spitting is indeed a major or minor offense in many asian countries depending on the offenders level of health another piece of trivia was when stephen chow during the villainous portion of sings life and career was posing with the mute girl underneath the poster like ginger rogers and fred astaire  similar to a tableau reenactment with tom cruise in vanilla skystephens debut drew off of many cinematic moments not just cagney plus astaire and rogers  there was a large dollop of the matrix whether neos fight with the many agent smiths or even the music from the movie itself chow also had a zamfirlike panpipes at the end of the picture that many kung fu films use apart from quentin tarantino in the end of kill bill volume 1 the real life wile e coyote and road runner chase between himself and the landlady was hilarious and hinted how everyone is not what they seem especially with her secret master power grab your earplugs there was also the gay tailor and the cook who had hidden sides to themselves while some were straightforward characters like coolie and sings overweight sidekickthe insane beast appeared idiotic but was in fact more evil by not necessarily being evil but just wanting to fight someone worthwhile  it was this character who added a level of fighting not seen in any matrix nor most jet li and jacky chan flicks in the fight with paris and helen of troy  the fatal lovers  there was a twistershredder moment as i call it where you just have to see it to believe it when sing transformed into the hero he secretly longed to be he too added new kicks and blows heretofore unheard of in kung fu sagas its very obvious that warner brothers cartoons played a major part in developing his imagination chow has even left a backdoor open in more ways than one for other future kung fu hustles heres hoping we all can get kicks from them too,comedy
i am not a martial arts movie buff my knowledge about the hong kong  mainland film industry is limited to jackie chan chow yun fat and jet li i did not know stephen chow until yesterday when i heard a radio jockey speak about the movie it had been some years since i watched a kung fu flick and as the radio jockey had given a positive recommendation i decided to watch the movieif i were asked to describe the movie in one word the word is awesome the movie rocks from the start to the end mind you there is nothing exceptional about the plot just like so many other movies its basically the struggle between good and evil of course good prevails in the end but the best part is how different genres blend in the plot it has action phenomenal fx slapstick and to complete things theres even a love story stephen chow who happens to be director producer writer and the hero has done a great jobif you liked the action scenes in kill bill  the matrix you will definitely like this one in case you did not like kill bill  the matrix ignore the reference while watching the movie some of the scenes reminded me of both kill bill and matrix an alternative title for the movie could have well been neo in china turns out that its the same action choreographer yuen wooping brilliant choreography a visual treatthe only thing that i did not enjoy in the india release was the dubbing done by artists who try to talk english with a chinese accent i thought it was downright phony and unnecessary why couldnt they stick to a neutral indian accent anyways apart from that the movie is superb id rate it 1010 last but not least when you watch the movie remember its reel and not real itll help in absorbing those unbelievable action scenes enjoy ,comedy
i often marvel that stars like bruce lee jackie chan jet li and chow yun fat are immensely talented in terms of their acting coupled with physical prowess i now humbly add another stephen chow to that esteemed list the movie is cowritten coproduced directed and features chow who is a huge star back in china and who honestly became known to me via the quite silly yet thoroughly entertaining shaolin soccer set in 1930s shanghai it is not your typical chinese kung fu or kick up flick it goes beyond that through insane sight gags and gimmicks all of which are incredibly funny totally ridiculous and intensely actiondriven the movie is definitely a homage to the genre given how well it is done but i find it satirical as well where else can you find a character who smokes like a chimney even when she is fighting and the cigarette never once falls out her mouth how convenient that the skills demonstrated by some of the characters seemed learnt on the spot it really requires that you check you r sensibilities at the door and your pulse once in a while as it races along the only way to further describe it is as a virtual liveaction cartoon filled with such appealing caricatures as opposed to characters you re bound to oblige them ninety 90 minutes of your life there is so much to say about this movie but i should not for fear of ruining it the juxtaposition of the violence of the gang  the grace of the battle and yes folks dance sequences at the most inopportune moments is plain brilliance chow plays a lean wannabe member of one of the most infamous and deadly gangs in shanghai the axes he and his buddy go into pigsty alley pretending to be members of the axes and find themselves in a heap of trouble when the real axes take offense to their foul ups and the impact on their reputation as with all good films of this genre there is a love story test of courage and redemption of honor  the twist though is that the philosophy and humor are not readily apparent because you are visually arrested by the glorious choreographed fight sequences the movie does not let this on that easily though as it is only when it wraps up you realize how much more was going on this is one flick which is destined for cult status,comedy
this is definitely one of the best asian comedies ive seen in a while they have successfully surpassed shaolin soccer with flying colors stephen chow is a very unique individual to come up with a concept like this for the traditional kung fu style cinema when i seen this movie i really didnt know what to expect just when you think that you would figure the movie out it would just turn another direction and amaze you the fact that the action sequences were amazing yet funny was what was so attention grasping i cant remember a time during the movie where i didnt laugh its not easy to integrate humor with fighting sequences but they pull it off perfectly my hat is off to this movie and its creators my 5 bucks were well spent because i got more than what i bargained for,comedy
upon hearing about this film i became skeptical of the idea of a comedy based around kung fu and i worried that a good job would not be done and that it would be quite a struggle to enjoy with the drama mixed in i was proved wrong  i found that the film was magniciently sequenced from beginning to end with very interesting and innovative fight scenes as well as with the proper comic reliefthe acting was very professional and genuine with the characters being portrayed well it was easy to become sucked into the story with the terrific acting of everyone involvedthe story was top with each new twist and turn making me more interested in the plot of the film as a whole when the film ended i was left fulfilled with the story and quite excited about the whole ordeal hoping that more work along these lines would be done in the future a tremendous triumph for cinema,comedy
it is hard to mark a movie such as this i give it a 7 just before i liked more a lot of other movies but essentially for what the movie wanted to be it was almost flawlessthe script is funny with a lot of irony and humor unlike the silly childish humor most chinese movie have combine this with the references to american cult movies and you get something edible for the western public but its not only this the action scenes are great but so are scenes in other movies what sets this one apart is the choice that the director makes not to follow walked paths be innovative funny and subtle in the same time you will find major themes of human stories in this movie but packed so nicely in unexpected and vision that you end up feeling youve seen a film unlike any other and so it iswatch this one especially if you are am asian movie buf,comedy
were introduced to the axe gang a mass army of suited henchmen who command sway over the hotspots of 1920s china with a brutal slaying worthy of scorsese they summarily break off into a choreographed dance routine over the opening credits and its clear that were back in stephen chows world in the provincial towns a burly landlady screams at her tenants with such force the ground shudders and the windows smash an axe gang leader is given a bad hairstyle by one of the towns folk and soon the whole village is under attack sing chow wants to be an axe because being a bad guy is cool he helps the protagonists get the beast out of a mental asylum so he can defeat the screaming landlady and her dithering spouse in kung fu combat chows inspiration is as much western as it is eastern with obligatory bruce lee parodies in tow alongside brilliant takes on gangs of new york and the matrix the madcap surrealism of shaolin soccer is at the films heart but the greater scale of this production partly financed by american money dictates a much more polished accomplished piece chows maturity as a director has blossomed the setscostumescharacters are vividly imaginative while the pace of the humour is expertly complimented by a much more sinister darker overtone something chow seems to have embraced full heartedly while chow the comedian has never looked better with a heavy endorsement of cgi responsible for the more irreverent comedy chows performance sees him finetune his chaplinesque timing cuddly dexterity and bruce lee intensity to absolute perfection underlining the fact that if hong kong comedy has any future at all its firmly up to the fate of stephen chow this is a delightful kung fu romp if you dont find something to love about this movie then you should check if youre still breathing,comedy
ohmygosh i had so much fun at this movie i love that the director has such a wonderful sense of humor this movie parodied sp so many movies and much more cleverly than scary movie nausea much did i know that there are more than i caught just off of the top of my head i saw references to shaolin soccer the shining gangs of new york and the matrix grr dont get me started on that movie who says that recycling actors cant be fun i love that the people that the director used in shaolin soccer could play such different and fresh characters there is so much to say about that i will really have to limit myself to the performance of the actors as well as the wonderful visual effects blood in the halls frog jumps and giant handshaped hole in a buildingthere are no words oh wait i can thing of one wow the visual representations of the more spiritual parts like the buddas palm technique are very very cool i agree with one person who said that the effects are imaginative while they were fantastic they did not overwhelm the performance of the actors this is quite a feat since there are so many effects used all in all the actors are fantastic wonderful comedic delivery good use of silence and dramatic points delivered splendidly as well stephen chow rocks,comedy
stephen chow offers a madcap tribute to classic hong kong cinema with not only is he the star he wrote directed and produced the movie chow plays sing a hapless thief who wants to join the welldressed axe gang along the way he exhibits amazing martial arts moves as do other residents of pig sty alley the action is fast and loose with cartoonish moves presented in live action there are several funny characters starting with qiu yuen who plays the formidable landlady much of the humor is classic hong kong slapstick but you dont really have to be an aficionado of kung fu movies to like this story its a huge spectacle for all to enjoy,comedy
i just loved this movie it has a simple but well driven story stephen chow talent is imminent not only because he has written directed and acted in this motion picture but also because he like me is a lover of kung fu moviesasia has produced some amazing movies in the last years some of them i considered masterpieces like oldboy hero or crouching tiger hidden dragon and others are as entertaining and thrilling as a roller coaster like ongbak and now kungfu hustle which is going to make you smile forever i couldnt stop laughing while i was watching itstephen chows character sing is desperate to be accepted by the most evil gang that ruled shanghai in the 40s the notorious axe gang which is formed by guys dressed in black suits although he wants to be a bad man and doing bad things everything goes wrong every time he try it mostly because he doesnt know how to fight or how to make a mayhem action because deep inside him he is pure so in his search for becoming an evil man he gets into a small housing little village where lives humble people and he tried to blackmail a young hairdresser and here is where the good action begins the first turn in the movie comes when three great kung fu masters who had lived uncovered among the humble people shows his power to defend the people in the village then the axe gang leader hired two great kungfu assassins to take revenge on the people of the villagethis movie has many hilarious moments one of my favorites is when the landlord after he and the landlady shows their real power in the second big turn of the movie is talking with one of the almost dead fighter after defeat the two assassins and he speak in english stealing the sean connerys line at end the untouchables of brian de palma when malone tells to eliot ness what are you prepared to do and then the landlord tell him why are you talking in englishthe fights are awesome very well choreographed of course by the master yuen wooping best known for his collaboration in the matrix sagathe subplot story of sing and his love interest is simply wonderful though they never talk each other the looks and the flashback are enough to create a beautiful love story just like a chaplin movie as i said before i just loved this movie you should see it,comedy
i thought this movie might be fun from what i saw in previews but it was much better than i expected the action is often eyepopping with riffs from warner brothers toons and the matrix but with a chinese flairthere is a lot of imagination in the ways that each character uses their individual style of kung fu and many of the butt kickers are the least likely to go bruce leethere are many hysterical bits in this film and the characters are much easier to relate to than most kung fu films dont let its connection to crouching tiger hidden dragon fool you this film is never boring its the single best chinese film ive ever seenyou just have to see for yourself how much action and bellyache inducing laughs there are in this filmif you liked kung pow enter the fist youll love its the kung fu film that others will be compared to in the future its that greatthis film is a blast the only thing that kept me from giving it a 10 is that a couple scenes are a bit much and too intense what happens to the little boy after he gets bullied is a bit extreme otherwise this film is a riot,comedy
i enjoyed this movie so much i saw it twice in the theaters if you enjoy martial arts movies you should see this based on the action alone if you also enjoy a good comedy there is a lot of slapstick and funny lines to keep you laughing through much of the movie there are enough plot twists and interesting characters to make this movie satisfying to watch i dont want to give too much away but the kung fu masters in this movie arent the typical ones which is very funny the movie keeps you interested with this curious blend of martial arts special effects and comedy i would recommend this movie to almost anyone  young and old,comedy
i watched this movie after viewing a trailer on the official website i can well and truly say it exceeded all expectations that i had im not a great fan of kungfu movies and often find the fighting and other nonsense that goes on unrealistic and uninspiring kungfu hustle takes a firing shot at the stereotype combining both amusing and gripping fight sequences accompanying the kungfu in this film is a wellwritten storyline featuring a reemergence of a previous love a fellowship of fighters and a musicalstyle routine from a group of japanese dancers steven chow manages to pair both comedy and action to form the most enjoyable film ive watched of the year so far whatever you do dont miss the opportunity to go out and see this masterpiece,comedy
few weeks ago my friends and i went to see previous work ive seen by director stephen chow was shaolin soccer i recall upon arrival of the dvd i got from yesasiacom several years ago ive been showing around that dvd to my friends along with my sassy girl needless to say i thought the flick was hilarious and the use of cg as a storytelling tool was breathtaking the previous movie before shaolin soccer where i saw cg working to its benefit was storm riders story wasnt built around the cg aspects but the cg made the story better wacky imaginations just come alive in cg form and generally thats what is all about stephen chow doesnt hold anything back but throws tons of conventions and cartoonish humor with dazzling look and pazzazz here he paints the movie using genre conventions as his brushstrokea man who obviously loves the kung fu genre sappy love stories and cartoonish wackiness the slapstick in the film work mostly because they are cgs done with great artistic delivery the scenes are also beautifully lighted and shot the action scenes are dazzling overall its a very welldone comedy with lots and lots of imagination if there is any fault with this movie its not really a fault really it would be that as a story its not as wellstructured as shaolin soccer in shaolin soccer for example you can generally see things being set up bad guys are introduced etc and they will all somehow come together is somewhat less predictable and some things come out of left field often in a good way and in some cases odd ways but hey one has to realize it is a comedy and that already allows it to have its own rules did it work as a whole if you dont like it you will at least appreciate it for its virtuoso filmmaking,comedy
in an alternate world that has some correspondences with the thirties albeit the thirties as reinterpreted through the movies chow desperately wants to join the axe gang he tries to win their favor by lording it over the members of a ramshackle village  which unbeknownst to him harbors many kung fu mastersjust a classic and pretty indescribable the only reference point i can really think of is an odd one walter hills streets of fire which is nowhere near as good as this movie but has something of the same vibe good and evil played out in an alternate world where anything goesa fine mix of comedy action very touching melodrama music and cgi action the big fight here between chow and the members of the axe gang is like the big cgi action sequence in matrix reloaded done rightits seamless moving effortlessly from one mode to another i respect chows decision to almost be a supporting player in his own movie greatly as it becomes less of a star vehicle and more of an ensemble piece plus its not like the movie isnt suffused with his sensibilitythe rather touching message of the value of love and friendship and goodness even when it seems to be cursed by the world is welcome i think plus chow admirably doesnt overdo it the whole melodramatic aspects are handled very delicatelyi cant say enough about this movie easily the best thing ive seen this year to date and also the best thing ive ever seen chow do highly recommended,comedy
for many of you that never watch this movie before it hits the top 10 box office and break the record of the following countriesnote in us dollar million china  20m hk  8m indonesia  1m japan  17m malaysia  25m philipine  1m singapore  3m south korea  6m taiwan  65m thailand  13m quoted from malaysia newspaper  wwwthestarcommythis is the biggest hit in asia i personally try to watch in malaysia cinema and 3 days prior release of this movie my friend tried to make phone booking and apparently 90 of booking sold out just after 30 minutes my friends from india wanna watch this movie since this is the first time they visit malaysia but they went to cinema twice after this movie released in nation wide they still cant get a single ticket not even in the first row eventually they got a chance to watch this movie in cinema which was one month later in south east asia it is common that people do watch pirated dvd and cd this is the first time that pirated sold out in first 2 weeks bear in mind that the odds that people watch pirated dvd is 10 to 1 versus people watch in the cinema so take a real guess the actual number of times people watch this movie in south east asia personally i watched it over 20 times and like many of others i actually went online research the making of this movie stephen chow unlike the one showing in the movie as in the real life he is indeed a very demanding and serious type of person he actually took himself in the position of director actor as well as script writing many of the pig sty city research in details from the 1940s of the shang hai model of life style and even of the many actors and actress are carefully chosen among the crowd some even share the same title with bruce lee jackie chan aka the 3 dragon many of the fans were very worried when during the filming process there are actually quarrels between some casting crew with stephen chow and people left the job cause of the over demanding of details in making such movie i personally pay a great respect to stephen chow not just that he can act script writing and directing a movie but his spirit and passion to make a good movie which inspired a lot by bruce leei wont touch the story of the movie well u can watch the movie yourself and make your own judgement ,comedy
this is an excellent movie it is a feel good funny movie i could hardly stop laughing and some of the fight scenes give me a rush i thought the special effects were spoton i cant think of a bad thing to say about it i enjoyed every minute this is the first of stephen chows films that ive seen i think he made a great job in the making and the same goes to the great acting from the cast if you like kungfu and comedys youll love this film there seems to be lots of new faces i wonder if maybe stephen chow got lucky and come across a school of kungfu masters who just so happened to be great actors at the same time however i look forward to seeing them all again in the next of chows movies which i hope wont be too long in waiting,comedy
heres a few tipbit about this movie he managed to get the legendaries actors in hk to work one in particular is the actual grandson of the famous wong fei hong the wellknown martial artist whom jet li played several times in the movies such as once upon a time in china i ii etci was blown away with the talent of his when he did shaolin soccer ive watched many of his previous work they all comedy like and enjoyable but it was as impressive to say its that great shaolin soccer changed it ive shown it to soo many friends and everyone enjoyed it i still laugh out loud at the scene when the girl hits her head on the soccer field  is a more traditional blend stephen is a big fan of bruce lee so he blended a few more interesting stuff not to mention if you have watched many movies coming out past years matrix kill bill etc you would notice a similarity within cause he tries to make it a more western acceptablei enjoyed the revamped of classical chinese music with a contemporary flare at first it was hard to digest but then it blended wellobviously at some point you can tell the wirefu connection but overall this is a really enjoyable movieshaolin soccer inspired me with its unique style which inspired me with my current film a jokers card while went to the next level of comedy mixing with kungfu fighting,comedy
my family had to practically drag me to see this film i thought it would be awful i was pleasantly surprised this movie has everything a great movie should have excellent action sequences truly funny characterssituations and a charming romance subplotthe r rating is not quite correct in my opinion it should have been rated pg13 dont let the subtitles scare you awayonce you get used to it its really easy to read and watch at the same time too bad it wasnt advertised better in the us because i dont think it will do very well at the box officego see this movie and you wont regret it 810,comedy
well i felt i got my moneys worth i have read some of the other reviews here and they describe the films story elements in detail so theres no need for me to go into that territory i would like to add some of my own colors however as a matter of fact i walked out of this film smiling and pretty well satisfied i have seen a good bit of imported chinese cinema not a lot but i know the basic product which allowed me to sit through this feeling less shock i think than the people sitting around me had i not been so schooled i think my reaction wouldve been a lot like theirs it was really a joy to listen to these peoplefor the first hour they laughed and gasped because the gags and the action were so relentless so over the topand once they were through with the first hour and realized that they still had another hour to go and that the pacing and intensity were not going to let up they all fell into a stupefied stunned total silence they were just flatout overwhelmed absolutely dumbfounded every one of them so the movie finished up and slowly they all filed out still wordlessi never heard one of them say a goldarned thing past that onehour markso yes if based on the trailers and the poster art you think this is your cup of tea by all means do go see it it is an entertainment,comedy
it humorous and very funny much better than any recent hollywood comedies the movie tells a lot about kongfu but not a little bit boring i am not that much a kong fu lover but i enjoy seeing the kong fu scenes in this movie i laugh to tears when stephen chow was trying to run away from the landlady and use the blades on his shoulders as side mirrorsthere are a lot of such humorous scenes in this moviethe world is full of funny discoveries and i think the director has great imaginations the story is great too though i cannot understand what the language it doesnt affected me that much the actions are greati am glad that i actually watch it and i am sure you will love it too,comedy
perhaps the best thing about is how selfaware it is the matrix reloaded and revolutions may have had some very cool chopsocky fights but the directors took it all so seriously it took a lot of the fun out of it for me realizes how inherently silly it is and doesnt try to hide it it revels in itin the films hierarchy of gangs the axe gang reign supreme in the films opening the leader beats a man to death and shoots a woman in the back with a shotgun this is followed by axe dancing the only people spared their choreographed doom are those who live in deep poverty so sing stephen chow and his partner decide to masquerade as axe gang members and extort some money from such a place they are surprised to find out that three kung fu gurus live amongst the districts tenantsits a good rule of thumb that if youre going to spend a bunch of money on cgi that you might as well have fun with it takes this to heart one guy uses steel rings on his hand along with two other guys to beat up a legion of axe gang members in another scene sing is chased by the landlady qui yuen with those little speed blurs that always followed the roadrunner and most memorably the landlady catches her husband wah yuen with lipstick on his cheek and throws him out of a building he falls down hitting a number of things on the way and when he hits ground a flowerpot falls on his headim going to take this minute to praise stephen chow because he stars in the film he directed yet avoids the pitfall of selfindulgence instead of making his character unbelievably witty and with an unattainable love interest something woody allen cant seem to stop doing he plays a pathetic and intensely despicable character up until about the last fifteen minutes actually scratch that he does have a love interest but she has so little screen time shes barely worth mentioningthe oddest character though has to be the beast siu lung leung about halfway in the movie sing is accepted as a member of the axe gang the axe gang leader needs someone to get the beast and sing is the only person desperate enough to do it you see the beast was so obsessed with kung fu he went crazy and its up to sing to free him im not going spoil the moment but lets just say that hes hardly the image of terror and bloodlust sing expectedhas such an infectious tone that it helps to cancel out some of its flaws for example just about everyones personality changes immensely in the final few moments and im even willing to forget the handful of grossout humor moments because is a joyful film and its rare i ever see that these days,comedy
i couldnt believe how good this movie wasim in shockyouve never seen a kungfu movie like thisthis guy is the chinese tarentinoi highly recommend this flickthe landlady alone would be worth the price of admissionon wholeme and my wifewho normally yawns through actionadventure of any kind were both highly entertainedi cant say enough about this filmthe special effects were done well enough to suspend disbeliefthe plot was novel and although not entirely newwas quirky enough to keep you guessingive seen a lot of martialarts filmsand this is the best in a long whiletons of funny momentswatch this moviewatch this moviewatch this movie910 starsexcellent i cant recommend it enough,comedy
well steven chow has managed to make me laugh so hard i almost hurt myself the wisdom not only to bring back kung fu stars of the past but to use his incredible ensemble cast for sholin soccer was amazing and for those of you who werent paying attention to the great movie homages then you need to go back and see this film again im going back in about 3 hours better take a crash cart with me i love that among all th violence he manages to throw in a cute little love story the only down side is that this is not as family friendly as sholin but for those who can handle it it is worth the time and money to see this one,comedy
i grew up watching old kung fu movies and the tv series kung fu with david carradine and have a certain fondness for the genre the latest rash of kung fu movies have been good but they all seem to take themselves too seriouslythis movie doesnt in fact it doesnt take much seriously the stunts and special effects seem like they belong in a bugs bunny cartoonstephen chow is a great talent he is very accomplished in martial arts but is also well on his way to perfecting comedic timing all the while remaining sexywah yuen was great as the landlord a lecherous old coot who seemed to be made out of rubberqiu yuen the land lady stole the show for me however i think everyone knows someone usually someones mother who has mastered the lions roarthe stunts were spectacular it takes a great cast to make a good kung fu movie it takes a great cast to make a comedic kung fu movie thats still goodthe only reason that this movie isnt a 10 for me is that there were a couple of times that i thought i didnt need to see that its still a 910,comedy
this movie was great it was very funny amusing and had a lot of action most movies you may get sick of watching sometimes but this movie didnt really have any boring parts and i watched attentively the entire timestephen chow did an awesome job directing this film he used many different camera angles and it doesnt appear dull or typicali recommend this too anyone that enjoys kung fu films likes films that are a bit odd or weird anyone that enjoys laughing action films slapstick comedies or just about anyone else it is truly good go see it if you already havent experienced it,comedy
this was nicely done its a great sendup of and homage to all those chop socky films that have come from asia and elsewhere this was well produced funny and well paced the computer generated special effects were well enough done and just added to the overthetop comedic nature of the whole affair this movie does not take itself seriously and thats a welcome change after the overly pretentious films like hero and house of flying daggers the actors in this flick all had a good time in their roles and were fun to watch all in all this was a good bit of entertainment,comedy
for this movie all i saw was a newspaper clipping advertising it i wanted to see it because of that i go and to my amazement this has to be one of the most well put together kung fu films i have ever seen i feel that the cinematography is brilliant the story is funny pleasant and very well acted and the fighting is just brilliant i know that some of it looks fake some of it isnt possible but it is the idea there are inhuman powers or gifts that buddha may have given others i loved it i gave it a 9 out of 10 i want to own it i want to see it again i try to tell my friends about it they look at me funny it is a really good film if you dont care about the story go see it for the fight scenes alone you will begin to feel apart of the story and struggle and the fight scenes will soon just become a pleasant filler while you are trying to find out where the story is going it even reminded me of seven samauri except for the fact that the town was a bit different in this film they were a bit tougher there were even some sad times in the movie some characters were knocked off a bit too early so sad all in all i highly recommend this film i think i may have even seen some new shots in the direction i think this will be chows big break its sad to say that he was overlooked i am going to look for his other stuff im hooked,comedy
ive been lucky enough to watch twice now in a theater and it is my favorite film of the the last year for those of you who are wanting to watch a martial arts film in the vein of flying daggers you will most likely be disappointed this film is to martial arts what star wars was to sci fi movies raiders of the lost ark was to action flicks and the original texas chainsaw massacre was to horror ahead of the curve and able to be appreciated on many levels its incredible humorspecial effects and great performances make it a true surprise that delivers something new with each viewing i applaud stephen chows work and hope that those who attend future screenings will be open to an experience much more fulfilling than just a kung fu film,comedy
i watched this movie on dvd back to back with the dts dvd of oldboy i thought this was the much much better dvd not only was the movie fun and action filled the stylized cartoon actions of the characters added to the enjoyment altogether i really liked the way certain sly references were made to other films ie with great power comes great responsibilityand the whole story of the mute girl and the hero as children in my opinion pays as much homage to the classic kung fu films of the past as the inclusion of the great stars of the past being in the cast i have to say the sound on my home system was superb not only did the music and various sound effects move perfectly from front to back and side to side even tiny things like the tinkling of the metal rings on a characters wrists was both clear and almost wind chime like this movie should have been in dts a great job by the filmmakers and dvd makers,comedy
i saw this film yesterday and i figured i should write a review before all the enthusiasm has faded away but then again i could write the review in a year or in five years  id still love it by then gong fu is just a comedy classic when i first saw shaolin soccer i was sure this was chinese humor at its best but now all that glory goes to gong fu it deserves a place in my top 34 comedies list next to monty pythons life of brian holy grail and shaolin soccer the cg is brilliant the acting is great the humor is superb theres just nothing bad i can say about gong fu if you miss it your eyes will shrivel up,comedy
if you are any kind of fan to the kung fu genre you must watch this movie im happy that canadian and american audiences will have the pleasure of seeing this film i moved to china in the middle of february and i saw posters literally everywhere for some movie called i had no idea what it was about who made it i just assumed that if there arethis many posters for it any self respecting movie fan should check it out and well i did i loved the movie it was very funny and the fight sequences were fantastic it has quickly become one of my favorite movies steven chow is doing some really great things for the kung fu genre and i am really excited to see more of his films i had no idea there were so many i cant wait to see what he comes up with next,comedy
i went to see this movie early one saturday morning as part of a local film festival i had generally avoided modern martial arts movies and the pain which the kill bill movies had brought to me had convinced me that i was right to do so it was only the fact that i had seen the excellent zatooichi which kept any interest in the genre alive for me at allits hard to describe the experience as a whole those who have seen other stephen chow works such as shaolin soccer will recognise styles elements and even actors that they have seen before but this movie takes all of those to a higher level of professionalism production quality and allround enjoymentfor those unaware of the plot tells the tale of a small town crook and his sidekick who wish to make the big time by joining the axe gang the biggest and best crime gang in town the axe gang meanwhile have become embroiled in a more than minor dispute with a local flats complex known as the pig sty sounds standard enough but the production pace and imagination of this movie will have you hooked within minutessound and music play a big part in the audiences immersion into the world of watching the axe gangs coordinated choreographed victory dance at the beginning will have you bemused and intrigued at the same time and on throughout the movie the impact of sound and the great use of appropriate music will never skip a beat ensuring the experience is never broken or jarred for the audiencepicture of course is what cinema is largely about and there are no disappointments here the tone set early on is that of a cartoon and in the respect of the special effects and the depth of the colours used onscreen this film remains faithful to thatthe story barrels along and the script seems sharp although as this is a movie youll be watching through the medium of subtitles it is hard to tell if the original script was this biting for western audiences or whether the translators really knew their action movies and slotted in the best replacements for dialogue that you could possibly imagine in any case the movie will have you laughing with both its original jokes and constant nods to action classics such as the untouchables spiderman and the matrixlooking at the ingredients on their own theres nothing especially new where this movie differs is that as far as i know noone has previously combined such high quality production with superb action sequences and with such topnotch humour and it is in this respect that is much more than the sum of its partsi left the cinema aghast at and disbelieving both in a good way what i had just seen i await the general release of this movie which unfortunately is another few months away just so i can see it again on the big screen when this movie comes your way make sure you do the same im positive that you wont be disappointed,comedy
i have to give this movie a 10 because of the pure enjoyment factor i think most people get carried away with pointing out the little details in movies when whats really important for this type of movie is how much you enjoyed it this movie was definitely one of the most enjoyable movies i have ever seen its got the coolest characters which i say reminds me of looney toons and still the action is cool its fake out of this world kung fu action but the moves where still performed very skillfully and the movie really had something to it that a lot of other movies didnt it was simply just fun to watch i watched it twice already and my girlfriend was just asking to see it again her dad watched it and kept saying how good it was i definitely recommend this movie if your not concerned with the little this and thats and just want to have fun watching a enjoyable movie go see this this movie rocks,comedy
im chinese im sure that there will be a lot of fun your americans cannt understand because of the culture background like the landlord couples claimed their name as little dragon girlwhich was translated as helen that means nothing but a girls name and yang guo these two names a couple too are extraordinary well known by all chinese peoplei mean you can not find a single person in china who dont know these two names who they are and what they have done they are the hero and heroine in a extraordinarily famous martial art novel their love affair their heroic deed and the unhuman beauty of little dragon girl take the highest position in every peoples heart at the end of that story the couple who were almost god and goddess disappeared an no one know where theyve gone so everyone think its really ridiculous when the landlord couples announced they are just themthe extreme contrast makes a highlight while helen makes nothing,comedy
for the first time somebody has ever been able to bring comedy from a cartoon into real film astounding for the first time somebody has ever been able to be provide a fantasy with kung fu in it fantastic and for the first time i was sitting and laughing and imagining and appreciating a movie that has every little flavour of cinema in itawesome movie with fantasy and comedy and action and somehow its a musical too stephen chow is a remarkable director and he has made a movie that can be watched again and again i am still suffering from the pain infringed upon me laughing my head offdamn the actors from crocodile gang boss to the beast had some really interesting characterisation something different stephen chow that guy really does have a good comic timing a good taste for decent comedy and he sure knows how to make a person laugh and not kill him in the process the action scenes again too good the kung fu displayed just keeps you hooked you just watch and say wish i were like them very emotional moment for me i could see cgi in the action and it was a work well done the cgi was astonishing and the smoothness of each frame a taste to any creatives heart the romance hmm was this missing somehow na there was romance toobut of all there is this cute mute girl who i wish where my girl friend if anyone know her please tell her that i love her the comedy you have to watch it sheesh stephen chow really does know how to get into a guys heart the comics of the movie somehow reminded me of tom and jerry bugs bunny and pink panther he has just brought an animated cartoon into a real moving picturewowhow did he do that there is not a moment you can stop laughing except when the movie gets overits crying timethen sentiments damnthis has that too yup somehow it was there but not very touching i generally laughed over it too oopsthenhmmis that it i guess so but truly a worth film and if anyone says what just happened here kinda thingbreak his bones he doesnt deserve to see good cinema stephen chow well done youre the master bring more movies like thisplease,comedy
chows fertile imagination leads to a movie that is truly a 21st century experience and im just not talking about his use of cgi effects which allow for both amazing martial arts sequences but cartoony gags worth of frank tashlin and chuck jones while chows comedy can be quite broad he is exceptionally clever  theres a gag involving a cat walking on a roof behind a kung fu master that is simpsonsworthy much like the ax gang dance sequence which is teased in the trailer its an example of the constant flow of ideas hmmmsomething else that is a hallmark of the simpsons chow and his collaborators never stop coming up with new things making the movie a constant delightit would be a shame if the kung fu in the title would dissuade potential viewers from seeing one of the best comedies of the past 10 years,comedy
great i didnt imagine a kung fu movie can make me laugh so so hard it is a nice story kind of simple and soft but the situations and characters are beautifully constructed it is a movie for everyone who wants to laugh and remain with a big smile afterthe set is colorful and the story easy to follow through it looks a little cheap at first but from the start it will keep you in your spot and you wont realize that your out of popcornmy advice is to try and see it with subtitles cause their voices and the language just fits perfectly and give a very funny nature to the characters small dosage of metaphorical movie making and great ending make this one a great pill for those who wanna leave the theater with a little extra something you know like that kid in front of you while getting out of the cinema he says something like and did you see i wanna be able to do thatclearly hong kong production manages to put its money on the right people they mastered the effects and they give a new look to fighting scenes it is dragon ball style no spoilers i sweari remember getting out from matrix and it was the same if not a little bit more moved by the novelty of what it brings to mego see it buy it when it gets out on dvd and enjoy it cause it is a land mark for fighting genre and asian comedy,comedy
all i can say is brilliant this movie is the best ive seen ini dont know how long im not one for kung fu movies so i was a bit pessimistic about going to see it i am so glad i did it is an hilarious comedy and will have you laughing from the opening scene right up until the credits roll it has a bit of a matrix style story line with their search for the one but theres nothing serious about it its just constant amusement the special effects are a bit far fetched and exaggerated but i think that only adds to the fun of the movie i was on the edge of my seat waiting to see what was going to happen next if youre worried about wasting your money dont because you would be crazy to miss thisim recommending it to everyone  young old male or female it really doesnt matter  youll love it i left the movie theatre on a high,comedy
the funniest movie i have seen for quite some time compared to shaolin soccer this movie is much more sophisticated in terms of plot and effects apparent is that stephen chow has watched a lot of movies and when you watch the movie you will be reminded of that kwok kuen chans performance of brother sum reminds you of johnny depps portrayal of jack sparrow in pirates of the caribbean the cloud effects on several occasions are indeed as some people have already mentioned of reminiscent effects in ghostbusters the mass scene of one or few heroes against an overwhelming amount of enemies repeats but with nice comic effects the kungfu movies which have had some success in the west like crouching tiger hidden dragon hero and house of flying daggers are all drama and take themselves very seriously this movie comes from those same sources but puts a very entertaining countereffect on several occasions during the film i could not help but laugh,comedy
holy crap this movie is the best cartoon ever especially during the kung fu parts of which there are several and lets not forget the funny parts which flowed like cheap wine at an office christmas party and included hidden flakes of golden brilliance also theres an awesome part where a kid gets peed on on the headhow many of your fancy pants movies have that poindexter anyway you wanna know how good of a cartoon it is its not even a cartoon and its still the best cartoon ever got it jerkshmm it says i need more lines of text so here goes uh hmmmmmm ah yes this movie was amazing i dont want to spoil it or anything but theres this one huge fight scene and it totally rules and the beginning is awesome too seriously the only thing that would have improved this movie would be if the actors had been speaking more clearly it sounded almost like chinese or something,comedy
if going to the movies is all about having fun you cant do much better that stephen chows fistfurious comedy a follow up to his highly successful shaloin soccer is part comedy part musical part kung fu action film and part parody of american big budget films like gangs of new york and the matrixset in china in the early 1940s the movie primarily focuses on down on his luck sing chow who aspires to become a member of the much feared axegang that goes around terrorizing citizens and police officials using their weapon of choice you guessed itaxespretending to already be members of the notorious axegang sing and his sidekick chi chung lam saunter into pig sty alley aspiring to rip fear and respect from the commoners residing in the one apartment community but pig sty alley as it would seem is the justice league of america of china unbeknownst to even its citizens certain members of the society have powers of martial arts masters but when the real axegang members wander into town and begin to institute their own brand of dominance a tailor a baker and manual laborer rise to the occasion and the resulting kung fu battle leaves the ground littered with wounded black clad baddiesthis turn of events does not sit well however with the axe gang leader and he solicits the help of two musician hit men in a scenario reminiscent of robert rodriguezs desperado to snuff out the three new threats to the gangs credibility their success only leads to the revelation that there are two other members of the complex that have powers that must be reckoned and another more feared enemy known only as the beast is called upon to bring the community to its knees it is during the beasts strongarming of the locals that sing slowly comes to recognize his own inner strengths and his true calling on the opposite side of the conflicthas already become the highest grossing film to come out of hong kong with over 150 million already in the coffers before the flick even hits the lucrative american theatres nominated for 16 hong kong film awards has a little something for everyone in what can maybe best be described as big trouble in little china meets the matrix with a touch of zuckerabrahams humor and what a ride it isdirector writer actor chow does a fantastic job of juggling genres and introducing us to some of the most outlandish characters to grace our big screens in many a year a woman whos power is called the lions roar the musicians who can throw knives and even skeletal warriors from their instrument and an old man mimicking powers of a toad are just three examples of chows eclectic group of mystery menbut maybe more crowning of an achievement is the intermix of comedy  slapstick at that  with the action that dominates and drives the film if the saying drama is easy comedy is hard be true then kung fu hustles blend of naked gun type gags coupled with eye popping special effects and a subdued love story must have been an undertaking that had the films financiers saying an extra prayer every evening what other film could incorporate a dance number with a group of axe welding thugs and then later have a scene where one of the expected heroes of the film loses his head while innocently walking through the streets at nightinspiration for could have come from a looney toons episode of the road runner and willie e coyote a scene where sing and the landlord race at ferrari type speeds down a desert road results in a hilarious head on collision with a road side advertisement and was one beep beep away from being animeand hereto is where the production crew should get their chops had the budget of the matrixs advertising teams caterer but provides some of the best fight scenes and special effects that i have seen so far this year take for instance the scene where the landlord uses her vocal power through a makeshift blow horn to completely decimate the axegang run casino or the twisting of limbs when the beast takes on his adversaries these scenes crackle with originality and the production values that rival even anything produced by the major hollywood studiosi have very little bad to say about even the musical score by raymond wong was memorable and well chosen everything seemed to fit and despite a small gap of story development where both the action and the comedy take a back seat for about 10 minutes the movie is top rate and deserves the wests attention,comedy
i love this movie very much not just because i have been a fans of chow for about 15 years not just because of the great kung fu moves in the movie but the most important thing is that i am moved by the changes of chowused to be a famous comedy actornow have become a true director and let the movie to tell his dream and show respect to the greatest martial artist  bruce leewellthis movie is also very funny like the chasing between chow and the fat lady like the scene that they throw the knivesetc besidesthe dancing at the beginning is also interesting and the funny crocodile gangi wish you call love this movie ,comedy
stephens humor is kinda chinese smallpeople style which is quite difficult to express in a work of film from chows every movie i get the info from his humor that is average people get the biggest lives and thats why im quite in his movieskungfu hustle this latest one is a real cool i can relax myself and laugh in ease with the familiar chows styleevery characters act in the old shanghai mood and thats really attracting whole story tells in a fluent way like a way of kungfuwhen i catch this film i just thought itd another chows old style one but this is real overpass my imagination i can see chows bow to our chinese kungfu and i can taste his sweat in itfor chow for kungfu i also take a bowstrongly recommendation i give it 8 points,comedy
kung fu hustle99 mins distributed by columbia pictures written directed and starring stephen chow singchi fight choreography yuen wo pingwell what do you know yuen wo ping was the fight choreographer how did this bit of information slip under my film radar and here i was thinking while watching the movie we have a matrix imitator here who i must admit wasnt too bad and getting better with each fight  i should have known better that no one does hand to hand combat better than the master himself yuen wo pingthis movie is exactly what the chinese title says kung fu no hustle and even though its directed by stephen chow half the credit should go to yuen wo ping because there are that many fights in this movie more than crouching tiger more than house of flying daggers  its simply action packed with fist to fist combat interspersed with stephen chow comedy segments just as funny as those found in shaolin soccer and this is where the main difference lies with stephens previous effort the action and come to think of it with all his other previous films therefore yuen wo ping makes this movie his own as much as stephen chow doesaction lovers will love this movieacting  its so refreshing to see so many old faces in this movie and its a smart move by stephen as this elevates the movie to something that is not just made for teeny boppers like how the majority of movies are in hk because the movie industry here are so afraid that no one will watch there movies without some current fresh face who simply can not act or even have a screen presence the collection of so many fine experience actors in this movie is spot on and gives it more credibility as a movie thankfully the one young pop star in this movie is given a non speaking partspecial effects  unlike the matrix the cgi in this movie was again used to enhance the action and the plot like shaolin soccer and theres plenty of it no complaintshow does it compare with shaolin soccer i would say overall its definitely a more complete movie with better acting better story better special effects better characters just better everything except in one department the jokes are funnier in shaolin soccer but only because there were more of them has far more action in place of the jokes which is still very hk cantonese in flavour im happy to say while still retaining the universal comedy element that is needed to travel across all culturesi have nothing but praise for this movie its stephens chows best yet and the 100 million was well spent  he is a very talented man indeed  and yuen wo ping is the master of kung fustoryplot stephen plays a lowlife hustler with ambitions to make it into the biggest triad society because he wants all the riches and women that comes with it but despite his big talk he doesnt have the heart to do bad,comedy
i was talking with a friend of mine much more into martial arts movie than me who didnt like kungfu hustle because of the way it went about showing the fights and even for its goofy humor being too broad while i could understand the latter part everyones got their own sense of humor unless if someones got none which is dangerous the former puzzled me what does someone expect for example after seeing the trailer if anything director stephen chow is successful most in making a decidedly nonserious martial arts movie it almost reminds me of my youth seeing the ninja turtles fight there too was martial arts sometimes with well choreographed sequences with real martialarts fighters fighting in the costumes but like that kungfu hustle gets it right in being completely unpretentious entertainment its a comedy in the tradition of vaudeville and looney tunes with specks of tarantino the marx brothers yes also vaudeville but on a different plane and with characters that are left to be of course cartoonish but not characters that are too cruel or unlikeable eithertake the landlady of the establishment that the bulk of the picture takes place shes played by wah yuen as the ultimate badass lady you dont want to mess with on the wrong beat namely because of her look which is that of having been going too long at what she does to take any lip or disruption for her customers but then when trouble comes her way she then reveals herself as a screaming force to be reckoned with and all the while its done with a wink to the audience but taken seriously in its own comicbook logic chow also acts in the film as well as cowriting it as sing someone who wants to join up with the mob the axe gang but doesnt quite cut it at least at first it seems in the midst of this is a romantic subplot involving a girl he once knew whom he had to leave behind and when this is rekindled it strikes up some extra ambivalence and a little strife between him and his best friend bone played as a deadpan idiot by chi chung lam this all leads up to a showstopping finale where sing finally has to step up to a certain gargantuan challenge against his evil opponentits not necessarily a great comedy as sometimes it starts to show how goofiness can backfire in a couple of scenes plus the romantic subplot while very knowing of its own satirical place from kungfu movies past is still a little unnecessary at times but overall its the kind of film that i would recommend to non kungfu movie fans if youre expecting a work that takes its fights and stunts seriously like my friend did look elsewhere but if you want something that takes a grabbag of ideas and tosses them altogether to become something original this is the comedy to check out its visual effects go along with the tone of the comedy at most times like a superfast chase down a road by two of the characters and even more serious fights like the one between the landlady and her husband against the axthugs at night still has that air of a battered supernatural martialarts tongue placed firmly in cheek it is for lack of a better critical term a gas practically from start to finish,comedy
i really think if i hadnt first seen shaolin soccer also starring and directed by stephen chow i would have enjoyed this movie a little more thats because although there are some funny and very surrealistic moments the level of humor and the great storyline from this film is a definite step down however on its own its still a cute and engaging filmwith the most ridiculous kung fu action that makes this a minor parody of the genre of all the aspects of the film the music special effects and action are topnotch the story line itself is the weakest pointwith a plot that seems to meander and perhaps be a little pieced together looking thats because characters often rapidly change into totally different charactersalmost like there has been a rewrite midmovieoverall worth watching though not exactly the brilliant film its predecessor shaolin soccer was however it still is superior to such kung fu parodies as they call me bruce and kung pow enter the fist,comedy
when one watched the trailer of one realised that one could expect an intelligent movie that parodied the kung fu movies of yoreand when i watched the movie i got much more it is a sort of  parody as well as a tribute  a wonderful mix of over the top and subtletystephen chows character is nicely underplayed and subtle the references to other films are delightful the best one for me was the scene where one of the slum dwellers is dying and the landlord and landlady are mourning over him and the guy while dying sayswhat are you willing to do in english and the landlord and landlady reply in chinese why are you speaking in english we cant understand you while still crying the obvious reference to the untouchables where sean connery exalts in the same way to kevin costner is just hilariousto know that the film is funny when watching it with subtitles makes you appreciate how funny it must be in the original languagespecial effects and sub plots too are very interesting all in all it is a film that can be watched just to enjoy the visual spectacle as well as by the cinema goer who seeks out the subtleties of cinemaa good entertainer in his day jackie chan came up with some wonderful rib ticklers that mixed kung fu with slapstick and over the top acting and situations and although this cannot compare totally to his achievements considering the time they were madeit definitely is a good movie on its ownone of the few movies that stands out in originality creativity and brash in your face attitude among its contemporaries,comedy
in recent years the american assumption about hong kong cinema seems to be that their movies consist of chopsocky wackiness in that respect does not disappoint it tells the story of the axe gang who rule 1940s hong kong mafiastyle one of their members is sing director stephen chow who joined them because as he puts it when he was young he wanted to be a good guy but found out that it was easier to be a bad guy anyway the axe gang descends on a slum known as pig sty alley which hides some treasures but of course the people who live there arent going to let the axe gang run roughshod over them from that point on the movie becomes a cross between bruce lee and chris farley especially with the harpplaying scenestephen chow is clearly showing himself to be quite a director with this movie and with shaolin soccer admittedly is not any kind of masterpiece as far as i can tell it exists for the sole purpose of entertainment but lets face it thats the case with most martial arts movies you might recall that enter the dragon really had no reason for existence except to show off bruce lees impressive skills there is one scene in this movie where pig sty alleys landlady qiu yuen chases one of the gangsters in what appears to be a spoof ofhomage to the road runnerwile e coyote cartoons 100 cool,comedy
this is a warner brothers cartoon with an all chinese cast and it is hilarious the first five minutes of the movie are pretty rough and unnecessary but the rest of the movie is a delight there are some laughoutloud scenes as well as a lot of fights youd think with all those axes it would be kinda gory but it really isntthe landlady steals the show but her husband manages to steal a few scenes from her from time to time he fights like the cartoon character droopydeadpan and stationary they are a hoot togetheri noticed a few sly references to deadful melody and the shining thrown inperhaps i missed some others but i will see it againin my opinion appropriate for twelve and up providing they are familiar with the genre,comedy
stephen chow has always been a pretty slapstick sort of director but he really veers away from a lot of those ideals with the movie as a whole tends to lack the fun loving attitude he had in previous movies like god of cookery and shoalin soccer what we get instead is a pretty darkly humored violent film that tries to illustrate what the untouchables would have looked like if robin williams and jim carrey were on the marquis in short it seems awkwardbut hen again that was most likely chows intent taking a page from american cinema so the violence might seem more accessible what i really did like were the scenes with the assassins which really embodied the more classic elements of asian cinema and chows own wild vision i was also pleased to see kwok cheun chan had a better role this time around considering he was my favorite character from shoalin soccer in the role as empty hand take this movie for what it is and youll enjoy it,comedy
this is probably the best kung fu film out there for nonnative mandarin speakers it has humor visuals nonvisuals and a very matrixlike plot lineit would be christian based in plot if they werent buddhist since buddha just died you have to wonder what they are actually basing it on but it doesnt matter it doesnt have to make sense its a really fun action flick not hokey at all and very well donei have no idea who directed this or who wrote it but this film is made by the nuances no translation needed i give it 9 out of 10 because i have to hold out hope that this isnt the best ill ever see thats it,comedy
i just recently watched shaolin soccer before watching i found the 2 films very similar since the creators were the same people hustle still gave me plenty of hard laughs perhaps more than that of shaolin soccer i do hope that western people will get to see this film although im from asia i dont understand chinese i still enjoyed the film because the jokes are visual this made me conclude that youll enjoy it so much as well i wouldnt be surprised if stephen chow gets a hollywood stint after this film it contains spoofs for spiderman lotr matrix daredevil and its up for you to find out all done in a cgi filled actionpacked fun,comedy
the movie amazed me because of the following reasons first the movie was directed by a chinese whos famous in 20th and scored such high which is very rare second the film contains full stacks of chinese kung fu third the last part of the fighting between two gods was stunning,comedy
simply breath taking as was shaolin soccer so stephen chow has done it again but with more martial arts and off the wall comedic scenarios entwined to make this one of a kind masterpiece its cinematics are flawless as is the action and comedy scenes through out this classic and a solid 1010,comedy
wacky cartoonish martial arts action with a big cgi budget and rampant imagination similar in tone to stephen chows preceding work shaolin soccer its very much a case of style over substance as the plot only serves to move us from one outrageous set piece spectacle to the next and makes no bones about it thats chows style with far more focus on effectsladen fighting techniques than inscrutable storytelling and it works for him were treated to dozens of unique forms from countless unexpected sources as nearly every denizen of a dusty lowerclass slum turns out to be a kung fu master of some sort most memorable of course is the chainsmoking old landlady who batters every comer and effortlessly steals each scene without even pausing to pull the curlers from her hair its indulgent and silly watery and childish but its also richly entertaining and singularly stylish great background partyviewing material,comedy
seat back and enjoy the fun ridekung fu with a sense of humour,comedy
i find myself unable the tell you what the plot actually is i have no idea how the universe of this film works there are many moments where i have no idea what is happening none of which matters the film is a visually feast the gags mostly land and the weirdness ends up being completely charming this is a live action cartoon mixed the a kung fu destiny story it is an action comedy where each are the focus what a great style for a fun filmsadly the film is slightly marred by a mean streak that is misplaced and keeps bunting into the fun there are two different running homophobic gags everyo once in awhile the films goes too dark andor graphic of note the lovable rascal that is the heart of this film complains about how he hadnt raped anyone yet which just doesnt work as a joke this streak happens just enough to be annoying without fully ruining the tonethis film is just so much fun,comedy
chow directs produces pens and stars in one of the most unique action  fantasy films ever made this viewer revisited this film and it still stands alone with its mixture of phenomenal martial arts and sidesplitting comedy excellent direction cinematography choreography screenplay score and acting the entire cast delivers spot on performances with chow standing out the plot is set in the small peaceful town pig sty alley the world is ruled by gangs instead of the law and the most fearsome gang of all is the axe gang sing and his sidekick bone who are two con artists stumble into the town trying to convince its inhabitants that they are part of the axe gang the landlady rules the town with an iron fist and rules her husband landlord with an even harder fist she does this promoting peace over violence and does not take kindly to any intruders that practice the latter not all the residents of the town are as they seem which sing and bone learn of quickly their impersonation of being members of the gang reveal the presence of three kungfu masters coolie donut and tailor who immediately dispose of the axe gang and their leader brother sum this prompts brother sum to hire two musicians that play a magical instrument which propels swords knives shock waves and warriors that defeat the three kungfu masters we then learn that landlady is a master and she fights off the musicians with her voice in the aftermath the townsfolk want to fight back but landlady who always prefers peace explains that it would take a natural born kungfu genius which is one in a million to defend the town the landlord is also a master once again brother sum enlists help from the best fighter of all the beast this results in a brawl in a casino between landlady landlord and the beast which ends in a draw with a little help from sing fleeing back to town to recover from the fight it is then revealed that sing is actually the natural born kungfu genius the axe gang and the beast come to town for one last showdown unaware of who awaits them the plot is clever witty rare wonderful uproarious perfect and has a poetic ending there are so many memorable scenes in this film the best are the scenes shot in a cartoonish style to this day this viewer has never seen a film before or after its release that compares to its monumental brilliance with all the elements combined in this film it is a masterpiece and is one of the very best films in its genre,comedy
this review contains spoilersis a comedy movie that premiered in 2004 the movie is directed written produced and stars stephen chow the movie is the journey of a petty crook called sing as he tries to join the axe gang the movie is about his escapades as he comes into conflict with both the axe gang and the pig sty residentsis a relentlessly entertaining movie this movie features so much humor and comedy it has a slapstick quality to it which makes the movie into a liveaction looney toons cartoon the action and comedy scenes in this movie are the top highlights this movie is highly engaging because of these action and comedy scenes i felt that stephen chows performance across direction writing and acting was incredibly apt as they make the movie flow well these fight scenes are also one of the best action scenes in kungfu movies the action is so frequent like the slapstick comedy that the movie continues to flow at an electric paceif there are any criticisms on it would be on the lack of focus the movie focuses on sing but the earlier part of the movie had focus on the kung fu masters in the pig sty and axe gange rather than on sing since the movie needed to have this as the scenes were integral to the plot it did not feel like it worked perfectly as it pulled screen time away from the protagonisti would recommend kung fu hustlethree stars out of four stars for kung fu hustle,comedy
i accidentally bumped on this movie and i did not regret iti am a fan of chinese kung fu moviesi have watched many masterpieces and many disastrous kung fu movies but i keep on watching them whenever i canthis is not a typical kung fu movie this is totally insane and really funnyi dont know who came up with this plot but it worked for mei havent laughed so hard in years it is worthy of your timei am still laughing when i remember some scenes from the moviethe landlady is amazing,comedy
a great movie made here by mr chow in more ways than one not only are we blessed with awesome kung fu fight scenes but some of them are also hilarious i was laughing constantly watching this while being fully committed for the final quarter of this film in a more serious way i would recommend this movie to a friend,comedy
one of my favorite comedies one of my favorite action movies and by far my favorite foreign film this is a perfect piece of cinema and one of the very few where i dont hate my life having to read subtitles not a moment wasted it is equal parts engrossing emotionally and perpetually entertaining you will spend every moment either laughing marveling at the fight scenes or buying into the simple but effective backstory oftentimes you will be doing a combination of those things i love love love love love it,comedy
i laughed out loud even after watching this masterpiece several times i never watch movies twice but this is the rare exception thats worth it you have to understand the no brainer comedy concept as well as appreciate all the direct allusions to famous american movies where chows characters especially his character repeat lines of dialogue that made the sources so outstanding anyone who has not seen this movie should give it a play and wait at least 15 minutes before rejecting it outright and for my taste you have to watch the excellently dubbed english version it seems this site requires ten lines of text,comedy
2004 dir stephen chow  cast stephen chow danny chan yuen wah yuen qiu bruce leung absolutely hilarious martial arts comedy written directed and starring stephen chow the axe gang is the most feared gang in the country and they take aim at the peaceful pig sty alley but are surprised when their peaceful target is skilled in martial arts amusing setup travels from one fight scene to the next with a rather merciful conclusion what really shines are the exquisite visual elements and the humour propelled by the cast chow plays sing who wishes to join the axe gang but he is ordered to commit a murder to do so he reflects upon younger days when standing up for a young girl resulted in his ass getting kicked he is a wimp with a good heart and chow plays him to perfect comic pitch other characters include the beast who looks nothing like one danny chan plays the ruthless axe gang leader who tests chow and eventually misuses his control to dire consequences a landlady played by yuen qiu possesses the lions roar and becomes a force to be reckoned with yuen wah plays the landladys drunken husband with powers of his own bruce leung plays the beast whose transformation is both nasty and funny great mix of martial arts and humour that takes jabs at martial arts films that destroys the law of gravity score 9  10,comedy
stephen chow really knows how to leave the viewer satisfied at the end of every movie he makes from shaolin soccers sporty zaniness to the heartwarming theme in cj7 yet is a real package of absolute delight every character has their own sense of cartoonish individuality from sings bumbling to the screaming landlady i crack up every time she does her signature scream youre sure to have a good time i wouldnt recommend it to young children since it is bloody and profane but when theyre older theyll certainly get a kick out of it the sense of invention is in every shot taken and once you get started you dont want to stop watching,comedy
a film directed by and starring hong kong star stephen chow where wannabe gangster sing wants to get involved with the towns notorious axe gang this causes a rift between the gang and a group of great kungfu masters disguised as slumlords with a poor town caught in the fraywhile the movie is full of nonsensical comedy and oddball jokes and dialog this film is still quite entertaining  filled with martial arts action and featuring kung fu battles galore that will sure give you an pretty riveting experience you will also get a touch of philosophy behind the martial art and how chow interprets it in the movieset in canton china in the 1940s the setting and cinematography captured that timeframe beautifully and the visual and special effects were ok for the most part not too much cgi the acting was also ok for the most part despite all the slapstick and goofy humor  chow did manage to put in a dose of drama and heroism to make the story redeeming and somewhat meaningfuloverall it is not a bad actioncomedy fans of crazy and wild hong kong cinema would enjoy this flick immenselygrade b,comedy
the city is ruled by the violent axe gang led by the sadistic brother sum only poverty stricken slums like pig sty alley escape their notice the place is run by bossy couple landlords sing and bone come into the neighborhood pretending to be part of the axe gang bone is asleep and sing is a weakling who cant threaten a child the real axe gang happens to be walking by and its an all out fight however it turns out that there are actually kung fu masters among the poorstephen chow directs writes and stars in this slapstick comedy its wacky stupid and hilarious its a fun use of cgi its a simple rogue finding redemption story wallowing in the silliness of the kung fu genre this is about the silly humor and kung fu action i love the silly broad humor i like the wild kung fu action but there may be a little too much of it after a visually imaginative and engaging opening it loses a bit of steam but it always picks up whenever it goes back to the alley i wish this movie spends all of its time with the weird cast of characters in the alley,comedy
maybe i overrated this film but i loves this filmbest thing the slapstick humor and the fights worst script is weak but adds to the personality and makes a nod to older kungfu filmsthe first fight scene i saw was amazing i keep playing it over and over i simply love this film and to see the rating go from a 68 to a 78 makes me happy i saw this when it was released on dvd and at the time enjoyed it but now i have film knowledge i like it x2 more the thing that i can see being a problem is the script and the silly moments if your a casual movie goer then it could turn you off but even so the films fights alone should be enough to entertain you this is not a serious film have fun with it if you like slapstick kungfu silly well choreographed films im sure youll find this a blast,comedy
stephen chaw is an eastern sergio leone  quentin tarantino  groucho marx  john milius  bob foss and stanley donen at the same time  sergio leone in the milieu and style milius in epic exaggeration groucho marx in completely screwball approach to comedy stanley donen and bob fosse in amazing choreography and quentin tarantino in a nostalgic playing with the genres in addition jackie chan and buster keaton at the same timei have not seen a movie that is so successful a mix of styles and still has its own style when youre doing comedy its very difficult to keep the tone of the gags  especially in acting and miseenscene a tone that is always on the verge to go to failure  but still floats fresh and chic you even laugh at the graphic effects  i can imagine what the reaction was in the cinemas  when the audience was mass lifted after a couple of good jokes and than start to laugh at each and every tiny antic see once this movie or download it from the net  be sure that it is in chinese with the translation dubbed versions translated into english  will not do  this film has the same value for kung fu genre as once upon a time in the west has for the spaghetti western as  singing in the rain has for the musical  as  a night at the opera  has for screwball comedy  as meals on wheels  has for the action movies  the best that genre can offermustafa presheva,comedy
i must say when i first watched this film in the very first fight scenes i was like omg did they really do that its that kind of japanese moviethanks got i continued watching it and it was totally worth it once you get the point on the overexaggerated kung fu powers and once you realize the movie is supposed to be like that then everything goes greati kept laughing the entire movie its story development is good too full of surprises and it will surely attach you to your chair until the end of the moviei give it a 1010,comedy
is a 2004 movie directed and starred in by stephen chow this film is an action packed comedy that is set in china in the 1940s a time where gangs were known for their presence with the axe gang known to be the deadliestthe axe gang open in the movie with graphic fighting scenes ending in gruesome and painful deaths of civilians although the axe gang is initially after money it is clear that they will kill one for simply crossing the path with their known symbol the axe the only people whom they dont bother are the poor who simply have nothing to offer much like the ones of pig sty ally stephen chow plays sing in the film who is a young man who aspires to be associated with the axe gang after being bullied as a child he and his friend bone decide to steal the gangs identity and try to demand money from a hair salon in a small village surprisingly this small village also known as pig sty ally is full of people with amazing supernatural kung fu powers sing tries to fight with the weakest of the villagers but soon catches on that they are one of a kind he signals for help with the authentic axe gang showing up who try to defeat the village and capture sing and bone the axe gang are defeated by three members of the village who are discovered to be kung fu masters this starts a huge search for the axe gang to find a master that is strong enough to defeat the villagers for them and the protection of their reputation sing and bone are about to be killed due to their imposturous actions however as axes are thrown sing drops from his chains and is recognized to be a lock picker he is given three seconds to pick bones lock to save his life sing is successful and the axe gang allow them to keep their lives but send them on a journey to kill someone in order to become a member the two have many attempts to harm people however in most occurrences sing gets beaten due to misjudging character with all wounds including knife stabbings suspiciously healing this becomes a huge journey for the two explores the ways and powers of kung fu with scenes full of action and gruesome fights however there is a lot of comedy incorporated to make the film easier to interpret the actors are all chinese but in this version their voices are dubbed over with english which already adds the element of comedy the tones of the english voices are generally quite high pitched as if one is making a mockery comedy is also displayed in the words which have been translated into modern westernized word such as fagot are spoken which is an obvious mockery of the chinese linguistics of 1940s the names of characters and places are also very westernized and seen as a mockery such as pig sty ally or donut a name of the baker in pig sty ally this mockery adds to the comedic element along with the effects of cinematography kung fu its self is exaggerated throughout the film with great cinematography in order to show great effects and exaggerate the power of individuals these effects highlight instances where one punch can throw people though walls high up into the sky or simply characters run so fast that you cannot see their legs moving although there is a lot of comedy applied throughout the movie the links to kung fu and an effective story lines is still obtained strong themes of brotherhood such as the way the village groups together in times they are threatened tradition in the ways of kung fu hierarchy in the ways of kung fu masters and to never judge one simply by a glance in many occurrences is represented throughout the film mystical elements of traditional and old legends are applied throughout the film the different strategies represent the different masters and the skills they obtain separate characters to form the hierarchical line of masters once one has met their match if not killed they must bow to their master an accept defeat these are the elements of the film of what do not allow a complete mockery of kung fu and its relevance to the chinese culture the concluding scenes in the film are full of symbolism with the new life in the symbol of a butterfly that link back to the beginning of the film the link between the deaf girl fong sing and their childhood is referred back to at the end of the film displaying the long and touching journey of within this is symbolized with a lolly pop which is shown as great importance to both characters though out the film even in what we think will be sings death this film is very effective in the way comedy tradition and an effective story line is incorporated i would recommend this movie especially to an audience who can see past the comedy but into the elements of culture and symbolism within and enjoy a happy ending with suspense for what may become or future predictions,comedy

i am a huge admirer of the comic genius stephen chow the three movies that were released in america shaolin soccer and cj7 were strange but hilarious in its own way cj7 and shaolin soccer were more familyoriented than with chow became an overnight success that made american audiences knew who this guy was if they didnt know his earlier films beware though is rated r for sequences of strong stylized action and violence but this is a pg13rated film for sure its better suited for 13  up if they get the wacky style of violence and its humor the movie is set in 1930s china where the most popular gangs ie the axe gang rule and took what was theirs money women cars and a rundown slum called pig sty alley had nothing but limited water access food services and paying for rent all that changes when a wannabe punk named sing stephen chow and his sidekick bone lam tze chung enters the slum sing desperately wants to be a part of the axe gang but he is rather dimwitted and a bit crazy of course like any other slum pig sty alley has its secrets like the landlady yuen qiu and landlord yuen wah used to be the kung fu masters of the lions roar and the bendable twisting snake until they had a son who died and they ran the slum to remain in peace forever like any other character trying to be bad but turns out to be good sing is saved by a deafmute girl fong shengyi huang who was rescued by him years ago and now runs a vendor for ice cream when sing does become a part of the axe gang his first mission to free a legendary killer known as the beast siulung leung in order to defeat the landlady and landlord i wont say anything else here because there are a lot of surprises to found in this movie the fight choreography done by the legendary yuen woping crouching tiger hidden dragon kill bill volumes 1  2 is awesome hilarious and highly inventive its designed to be more like cartoons like looney tunes with the combination of jackie chan and quentin tarantino stephen chow as a writer director and actor accomplishes what was impossible but made it possible breaking the laws of gravity in every way the term for a movie like is weird but trust me youll crack up that funny bone of yours soon enough this is one of my favorite movies of all time dont believe me check out my list of the best movies ever made,comedy
if you are into these 13rd comedy 13rd martial art and 13rd fiction movies then this is for youthe best compilation of fun and imaginative martial art action with some hint of drama and romance and great music1010 not because its a better movie than say the godfather or other great movies far from it but for those who like this genre its simply the best there is very well made great acting the story is coherent and entertaining and you never get a boring moment time just flies throughout the movie a great feat hoping for another movie like this one,comedy
stephen chow brings comedy and kung fu to the silver screen in this tribute to the classic jackie chan kung fu movieswhat makes different from other chinese kung fu movies released around the same time is its humor while chinese films such as crouching tiger hidden dragon and hero may retell or reinvent the serious kung fu myths makes its mark by injecting cultural reference especially to the 1940s american gangster and humor both slapstick and referentialthough the film starts slowly dont abandon it too early kung fu hustles humor takes time to get used to but quickly becomes enjoyable and evident even in the midst of serious action sequences if you enjoyed crouching tiger hidden dragon love funny movies with good action or are just looking for a kung fu movie this is the one for you,comedy
this movie is a gem lets go ahead and get that out of the waywildly inventive and relentlessly funny is one of the most entertaining lighthearted martial arts flicks that youll ever seefrom the dance numbers of the axe gang to the surprising talents of some of the denizens of pig sty alley the impressive fight scenes and a genuinely sweet love story this movie just rocks it loses a little momentum in the latter half when the comedic elements are pushed to the side and the fighting is given sole focus but overall is a great movie for fans of stellar fanciful martial arts fighting fans of physical comedy and those who like to dabble in both both genres this is one of the best combinations of the two that youll find ,comedy
well it took him a long time to get there but eventually stephen chow who is currently the box office king of china got a movie properly distributed in the usa and it was his elaborate and funny kungfu homage although or perhaps because this one isnt family appropriate like shaolin soccer and cj7 it was the most successful in america of any of his films so farthe story takes a little while to get going because like all the chow movies ive seen this one has a multitude of characters who are somewhat developed first there are the three hidden masters men who have left behind the kung fu lifestyle to live among regular people but who rise to the occasion when thugs threaten the neighborhood the central character in the story however is the one played by director chow himself sing  a weak moron who imagines that he will become a wealthy criminal by joining the notorious axe gang hes accompanied by equally slowwitted but loyal bone chi chung lam in addition to all these heroes the landlady qiu yuen and landlord wah yuen are so dynamic and entertaining that they threaten to steal the movie and there is a series of genuinely creepy and bizarre villains from the mambodancing crime boss kwokkwan chan the two harpists who kill with music and the seedy deranged veteran master known only as the beast siulung leunga lot of people are going to talk about this film in terms of kung fu but im personally more interested in the philosophy thats expressed often through humor rather than the actual fighting chow seems to favor a fantastic style of kung fu that is accomplished through computers anyway and hes never had renown as a fighter what he is and deserves to be famous for is his wacky sense of humor and his ability to convey offcenter perspectives as is usually the case his hero here is a character who is more than just humorously flawed he manages to make us more comfortable with the ghetto environment of pig stye alley than we are with the plus and westernized surroundings of the axe gang this is a very impressive film in terms of the way that the design in the sets and the costumes came together to reinforce and heighten the directorwriters goalsmy only regrets about the film is that it feels a bit overstuffed perhaps too processed they really felt the need to get so much into this package that sometimes the story seems to get lost i dont think chows character takes enough of the center stage and the romance is perfunctory you could say that its primarily a comedy so those things shouldnt matter or dont need a lot of time but they still didnt work for me as well as they did in the case of shaolin soccer where i felt the story itself and the characters were more vital its hard to look at this movie as a thing in and of itself it often refers to other chow films and also to various kung fu classics so i think theres a bit of static or conflict between various aspects of the homage and the actual story of the film,comedy
i dont even know where to start since this is a kung fu movie i guess ill start from fighting scenes the fighting scenes in this movie looked like a mix of jet lis fighting scenes with dragon ball z fights though this movie often looked more like a parody but still the fighting scenes were great talking about a parody this movie spoofed all the most known kung fu films exept maybe the drunken master even plot was very typical for 70s kung fu films and in one scene the landlady qiu yuen was imitating bruce lee this movie has everything action comedy romance and even crime movie elements it would be interesting for kung fu fans and for comedy fans also stephen chow is a very talented hong kong director and if you liked this movie you should check out his other movies,comedy
ive been meaning to put up a review of this movie after i originally saw it during its cinema run and loved it watching this movie again on sbs tv the other night gave me a chance to check out whether the movie had stood up as well as i remembered it has for a lot of recent hollywood movies ive reviewed here recently and given good scores to say 7 or more out of 10 i have had one quibblewould the movie have repeat viewing value in the case of many hollywood movies i liked like say transformers or iron man etal the answer would have to be no is thus getting full marks for meit has repeat viewing valuenot sure if the intro to the tv version movie toned down its openingi seem to remember the cinema release having a more gruesome scene than what i saw the other night or maybe its just not as brutal as i remembered in any case the opening serves to illustrate the brutality of a large and villainous group of criminals known as the axe gang who terrorise even the towns police forcenext we see two buddies sing played by stephen chow and bone played by chi chung lam who are small time scam artists trying to get financial advantage by pretending to be members of the axe gang they try their scam in a part of town that refuses to be intimidated by them somehow the real gang is drawn into their scam and the gang gets whipped by the residents of that part of town the rest of the movie concerns the axe gangs attempts to teach these townsfolk a lesson and the choice of sing and bone on which group to ally themselves withwatching the movie again i was reminded of how hilarious it was there were numerous laugh out loud moments for me eg the scene where sing tries to act tough with the townspeople but finds all sorts of reasons not to fight them hilariousthere is also a delightful romantic subplot concerning sing and a childhood sweetheart of his as wellthis movie deconstructsis a satire of kung fu clichs in fact whereas i found the seriousness of the unbelievable martial arts in crouching tiger hidden dragon too much to take seriously the even insaner martial arts in this movie were a positive joy its quite cartoony at times too reviews of this movie will often mention its debt to classic warner bros cartoons like the road runner etc91100,comedy
like hero house of flying daggers and crouching tiger hidden dragon this film has the spectacular and slightly ridiculous visuals as key but unlike them directorwriterstar stephen chow uses them for comedy purposes and does so very well set in the 1940s a town in china is ruled by the axe gang and sing chow desperately wants to become a member he stumbles into a slum ruled by eccentric landlords who turn out to be disguised kungfu masters sings actions eventually causes the explosive kungfu battle between the axe gang and slumlords only one side will win and only one hero will emerge as the greatest kungfu master of all also starring wah yuen as landlord leung siulung as the beast zhi hua dong as donut chi ling chiu as tailor yu xing as coolie chan kwokkwan as brother sum chi chung lam or lam tze chung as bone  sings sidekick and xiaogang feng as crocodile gang boss the visuals mostly are what made me laugh a lot including a running chase sequence with cartoon sound effects probably inspired from road runner and the battle sequences are fun to watch too a good action comedy it was nominated the bafta and golden globe for best foreign language film very good,comedy
you know those movies that you know nothing about i think i only saw one poster or something for it before i decided to see it i needed to pass some time before land of the dead and i though what they hey i like kungfu movies should be entertaining that may have been the understatement of the year i dont think i had ever laughed as hard in a theater as i did with this movie heck i dont think ive laughed that hard sincethe story revolves mostly around a failure of a criminal named sing played by director stephen chow some of the other main characters are the landlord and landlady of pig sty alley as well as the evil axe gang and of course the beast all of the characters are great and memorablethe story is very cartoony in some parts yet also a lot darker in others there are heaps of memorable scenes such as the knife throwing incident and the fights against the axe gang ive heard of it described as looney tunes meets kill bill i would have to say that is a pretty good way of summing it upand now onto the fighting man its awesome it contains many of my favourite live action fights scenes i would have to say trust me if youre looking for really cool looking fights look no further than this movietheres some good character development in the story tothis is a movie where stephen chow truly shows off every talent a director could have camedy drama action and of course random pop culture referencesalso if you like this movie you should also check out one of chows earlier movies the awesome shaolin soccer its done in pretty much the same kind of style except a lot zaniertheres not really much more i can say about this title except its one of my favourite movies and i would gladly recommend it to fans of the genre or even someone whos never seen a kungfu movie before1010,comedy
went into this one totally blind as to its contents truth is is that i was mooching round the shops yesterday and came across an asian triple pack dvd at a bargain price since one of the films was jet li starrer unleashed i thought it was worth the cheap price on offer got home and the write up on the back of the case didnt give much away as regards plot for an axe gang some guy named sing wants to be in the gang and that some creaky old residents in a place called pig sty ally are tougher than they lookwhat i got was what i can only describe as a live cartoon full of class and style the sort of flip side to the more arty asian films that have rightly become massively popular in this present decade written directed produced and starring stephen chow sing is a remarkably breathless piece of work the plot is threadbare for sure but it really matters not because chow has fused the grand old genre staple punch up with balletic comedy its quite something to behold its as loud as a face off between motorhead  iron maiden yet its just so flipping tender at the same time incredible sequences will dazzle you one moment and then have you laughing the next im quite annoyed that i didnt catch on to this film back in 2004 but even now some 4 years later this film is still a breath of fresh air on the silver screen see it and roll with it enjoy 910,comedy
this film is absolute genius no it wont win any oscars yes the acting is incredibly over the top and yes the plot and script make no senses whatsoever but if you switch off your brain and just enjoy the spectacle of it all it is wonderful the visual effects are fittingly caricatured and the characters suitably outlandish stephen chow has successfully married the comedy of buster keaton and charlie chaplin with the digital mastery of modern day effects to create something truly unique if you are a fan of old style physical comedy and jackie chan then you will love this film it is a fantastic saturday afternoon movie for all of the family,comedy
i typically dont watch kung fu movies ive seen a few jackie chan flicks but really opened me to the genre and it is mostly mostly on the basis of the humor and the plot that i appreciate it the story is based around the steven chow character a street kid who grows up trying to be a criminal while trying to ignore the fact he is really good when his actions result in the attack on a small slum and the deaths of three kung fu masters he must join up against the gang and the psychopath he helped them release from prison that there is where the movie really comes together that by accepting who you are do you ever receive inner peace its the cartoon humor and the mystical fighting styles that capture the attention without it the movie is just a message picture the plot and style highlight the movie very well and the humor is innocent making the incidents that much more funny even when they are preposterous i recommend this movie to anyone interested in seeing it,comedy
kungfu hustle is hilarious this was my first hong kong comedy film and it is definitely a recommendation to any new hk film fanstephen chow is perfectly suited for the coward he writes and directs the film flawlessly the special effects are a little on the cartoon side but i think chow wanted to portray the powers like thisthe scene with the knives is painfully funny and it shows chows comedic timingthe fight scenes are spectacular and music is just as good even if it is stereotypical music of the orientalthere is a sweet and interesting idea with the mute girl which i felt was perfectly added,comedy
in all honesty i have seen a lot of kung fu movies and think some of them are totally over the top while trying to be serious dont get me wrong i love kung fu movies but i liked this one a lot because it did not take it self serious at all it made fun of those movies that are serious but in a campy way some of the visuals really surprised me and the one that i really enjoyed was the hand in the building the fighting was good and the choreography was fun but not anything super special the parts that kept the movie from being serious was the scenes when they were just over the top with the symbolism like the butterfly coming out of the cocoon and the clouds over the asylum and i think it actually added perfectly to the theme of the movie i also like the whole classic approach that the gang had i really like the dance sequence which was totally absurd and the whole look of the ax gang overall a very enjoyable movie but not something i would watch over or a movie i would recommend to everyone but it was a fun to watch and i enjoyed it a lot more than i would have thought,comedy
i must admit im a fan of stephen chow liked many but not all of his shows i can almost say that i grew up watching his movies at one stage of his acting career i thought his shows were going downhill then came shaolin soccer  i thought that was the best now the bar was up with there was still a good amount of slapstick comedy in the show that was his trademark other than that the kung fu was fantastic the story  very well done right amount of romance to gel the hard core action so retro and so enjoyable to watch one has to sit back and just take in the silliness and at the same time be amazed by the fighting scenes,comedy
what a hilarious film great overthetop silliness it is a parody of the martial arts film genre and so will probably annoy anyone who was expecting something more err realistic most but not all of the gruesome stuff is offscreen  watch the cats shadow there were for me in the uk occasional cultureclash moments of unfunniness but perhaps that is to be expected the great special effects are mocked along with everything else overall very funny,comedy
this film is a mighty fun 90 minutesthe plot a band of hatchetwielding gangsters holds the city in terror however they leave the destitute people of the pig sty alley neighborhood alone as they have nothing worth stealing thsi peace ends when two gangsta wannabe bums sing and bone bumble into the slum and stir up trouble in the name of the gang soon the axe gang is locked in a battle with the paupers of pig sty alley and their bizarre and comical styles of kung futhis film is a very good slap stick comedy there have been parodies of kung fu movies made before but none this good the laughs are reinforced by some really crazy characters most notably the daughter of the dragon fat chainsmoking landlady who never once throughout the movie removes the curlers from her hair the film is full of references to all kinds of other films ranging from kubricks the shining to the looney tunes road runner,comedy
oddly enough i found this quirky little movie quite appealing it took me a bit to warm up to the movie but in the end i liked the nontraditionalist approach to this kungfu movie the physical humor and the verbal humor while not hilarious was still pretty funny and i think more than anything the humor was effective because it came as such a shock and a surprise just because of the timing and the kind of movie it was but this movie didnt just provide laughs it also provided some excellent fight sequences the battles in this movie easily rival some of the top kung fu movies such as iron monkey lord of the wutang and others there was a perfect blend of true martial arts hand to hand combat excellent choreography and a bit of suspended belief weapons use and super abilitythe directing and the cinematography was spectacular there were some wonderfully captured shots that drastically enhanced the movies appearance and overall style as a martial arts movie fan i really appreciated this movies ability to mix humor with some very nice and stylized fighting scenes without making a mockery of itself and other good martial arts films this movie is a pleasant surprise for any kung fu movie fans,comedy
for those who dont mind reading subtitles i highly recommend as entertainment weekly said think kill bill meets loony tunes it contains spectacular martial arts fight sequences while being refreshingly absurd about it all and though the comedy factor is very high the parody aspect doesnt keep you from attaching to the characters and caring about their plight and the resolution of the plot the script has a peculiar habit of shifting the focus so that the first time watching it you really wonder who the main character is id recommend not studying the movie cover too closely beforehand discovering whos really important is half the fun all the characters are fleshed out with adorable little quirks that make every single one of them lovable even the villains the soundtrack and cinematography were quite enjoyable as well overall is a delightful piece of art youll want to watch it again as soon as youve finished,comedy
everything changes in this fantastic movie powerful to helpless passive to proactive mediocre to genius and of course ultimate master to mere pupil the movie changes itself from gangster to dance briefly to all out action and finally passive redemption the key players at the start turn in to bystanders and the meek turn to key elements of the plot a triumph of film narrative where the effects are blended to the plot and the humour is wild brutal and subtle go see this one now you will laugh and bellow and forget to eat your popcorn gannett,comedy
recap the city is ruled by a gang called the axe gang and ordinary people live in terror while the gangster lives in luxury only poor people are left alone and in the alley of the pig sty  life is running it slow course that is until failed wannabe gangsters sing and bone happens by and poses as members of the axe gang the people in the alley wont give up that easy and soon the real axe gang is involved however the people seem capable to defend themselves quite easy this infuriates the leadership of the axe gang and they are not too happy about the impostors sing and bone eithercomment this movie is just like a long cartoon not that it is animated but a lot of the effects and characters abilities are similar to those in a cartoon and just as many cartoons are funny and entertaining this movie is too actually it is hilarious from time to time the movie possess both visual comic along with sharp twists and turns and dialog altough dubbed the directing is very good use of special effects are excessive but that is just fully in line with the rest of the movie so it is fine in short it is a good performance of all involved both in front and behind the camera the result is a really funny movie with a lot of laughs810,comedy
i just added to my dvd collection its a very worthy title indeed the film tells the story of a wannabe thug who wants to join the axe gang one of the more notorious of chinas violent street gangs from there the film opens into a melee of fantastic visuals and quirky charms that can compete with the more lackluster hollywood scene these days when it comes to most comedies i meaneverything was executed great however i found myself disappointed with what i felt was the lack of comedy that looked promising from the trailers i expected the whole movie to be filled with these funny scenes but the whole movie wasnt dedicated to comedy which threw me off however that doesnt stop it from being a creative genius in its own right a good movie to own indeed,comedy
wow i was quite surprised by this flick i was expecting something akin to kung pow enter the fist or top secret the trailer looked a little silly and i never paid it much attention it came home on video though and after watching it we all agreed that we were pleasant surprised the story unfolded much like some other asian films like hero and house of flying daggers there was emotional struggle of lost love and underdog vs overwhelming force the special effects were a bit over the top but i feel they really did fit in well with the overall concept of the plot even through all the sadness and anxiety the plot provided it all did finish up with a solid ending,comedy
gong fu  is a comedy action movie made out of different genres like western martial arts and slapstick and mixed together in an amusing mix genres are imitated genres are spoofed it takes on a simple film clich and takes a twist on it thats where all the fun comes from here and from the many reference to other moviesthe action scenes are great as they are choreographed by wooping yuen from the matrix we have adequate fight scenes but chow even makes some fun of the seriousness of theseof course this is all form and no substance except for the mild social criticism but it is still delightful entertainment if just all movies that try to entertain in a simple way would be like this,comedy
unfortunately i talked my girlfriend into going to see this based on my experience with shaolin soccer this movie is not nearly as funny nor is it really trying to be as funny  there are slapstick scenes but the action sequences are while effective not as humorous as a typical jackie chan fight i wouldnt describe this as a comedy but as an action picture with some humoralso this film is much more violent than shaolin soccer yes its a very cartoony violence and for the most part nothing that bothered me but my girlfriend cringed every time someones head was bashed through a concrete floor or whatever so it was way too violent for herso i did feel guilty and conscious of my girlfriends discomfort while watching but aside from that i really think this movie is incredibly overrated its a good kung fu movie with comedic elements its got some clever ideas and quick moving action although its comedy can get a little too overthetop sillyjust be warned if you loved shaolin soccer that is not a guarantee that you will love this one,comedy
going into the movie i wasnt sure how it would pan out having seen the trailer and expecting a cheap matrix spoof however the movie surprised me by remaining incredibly fresh and funnyjust a warning i watched the chinese version of the movie and there were quite a few jokes that i dont know would translate well to english a few puns a couple idiomatic sayings so it may be a completely different experience with the subtitlesthe first half of the movie kind of passes by in a sort of confused daze as you dont know whats going on whatsoever and the jokes are on the cheap side however towards the middle of the movie an actual plot begins to take stride and both the action and the humor picks up by the end of the movie i was simply blown away at how good the special effects were and how all the loose ends of the story were neatly tied upall in all it was an exceptionally well puttogether movie with great visual effects and decent humor even if it takes about an hour to actually get into stride,comedy
this movie was amazing comedy somewhat hackneyed effects kung fu tragedy drama love bhuddist palm i laughed i cried i kissed 8 bucks goodbye the crazy thing was that i was really at the edge of my seat during a good deal of the action and boy did i ever laugh the spiderman reference was beyond value and the butt crack ridiculous i loved this movie it was a throwback to the comedy of sammo hung and yuen biao in kung fu only the martial arts were computer animated into absurdity like a more visceral but less over the top beautiful house of flying daggers go see it i beg of you go see this movie alleluia go see this movie,comedy
i did not read about this movie before i saw it as what i usually do with lots of hong kong films however upon watching the film you realize very quickly that there isnt a story  or at the very least i should say it is extremely lacking but even then this isnt to say that the film is very entertaining and surprisingly at times very endearingif you are a fan of hong kong films and what i mean by that is by older films like those that have started and continued to spur hong kong cinema then you will notice many references to these films the first and most prominent is probably the reference to house of 72 tenants with the sassy landlord and disputes over water to her use of language as this film was a film that made hong kong cinema prominent again as opposed to mandarin cinema it might be a reference to an unconscious or conscious desire for stephen chow and others that want hong kong cinema to thrive againbut even if you havent watched old hong kong films you still can watch this film and be entertained you are engaged in this entertaining ride with fight scenes slapstick comedy subtly beautiful characters and only do you stop to question what the film is about because that is a question that people ask in every film even though the answer you find is that there really is no story or that the entertainment factors vastly outweigh the story and can be seen as a fatal flaw to a film to certain people it is still something that should be watched and then you can decide for yourself,comedy
funnywicked and totally unimaginable this is kungfu comedy at best i love itrecommend to everyone who love kungfu and laughter the story is not great but like every stephen chow movie he want to send a message to remind his audience of lesson in life this movie has a lot of violent and kid should not watch it for dark humor and violent however if you are teen and understand and take responsibility you will enjoy this flick and have a blast when you go in and watch this movie treat this movie as a fun and energetic kungfu flick dont take this as a serious kungfu flick or you will be a little bit disappointed however as for myself a kungfu buff i love this movie for it creativity in choreograph fight scenes some of the fight scenes is breathtaking i mean there is more than 3 fight scenes in the movie every fight scene has a cgi add to it it make the fight scene more fun and interesting it is like adding more color to a painting to make it more colorful in this case it work beautifully i hope u guy will enjoy this movie and much as i am,comedy
to my surprise so many friends like this movie i used to think only chinese can understand chows humorwowat least it is not a bad thingthis movie uses too many computer techniques to make up the lack of action and story chow has passed though his golden period about previous decade and those movies affect us greatly i think the best of his movie is king of comedythis movie is not the hero dream but the story of a simple man who wants to be a great actor its just like chows true experience i think you can get more pure fun from it but maybe tears with laugh,comedy
this is not the type of movies like hero or house of flying daggers unfortunately i cannot call these two movies rubbishes because these still got some beautiful scenes well thats the only good thing for me about these movies obviously these movies were simply made for nonasian and for academic awards also for these not knowing much about chinese kung fu culture a real movie fan would find these movies have weak stories like the day after tomorrow scenes are incredible but story is very weakas a huge star in asia since1990s stephen chow finally moved his movies to the worldwide including earlier shaolin soccer the english subtitle is not very satisfying sometimes just uses simple translations for these funny conversations kung fu parts are very good very enjoyable actually it is not his best movie for me i think his best movies were some made in 1990s but im still looking forward to the second one stephen chows movies always the best,comedy
this is a slapstick true to the word if youve watched stephen chows shaolin soccer youll feel right at home with this flick i was able to recognize a few people from shaolin soccer in this movie including sings sidekick who plays the overweight brother in ss there is action in this movie but dont come in here expecting a real action movie even if the action director here is the action director of the matrixso ive heard in reality even the fights were goofysave for a few people do get killed in this one overall with its great cast of over the top wacky characters a soso story line and some clever gags this movie has something for everyone,comedy
after my first viewing at a midnight show i went home thinking  what the heck was that did i wait 3 12 years for this what happened what a letdowni know many will not share my sentiment and probably think im a nut case for saying this but listen to me im a big big big fan and i started watching him waaaaay back before the 90s it wasnt even on cinemas then i watched all his obscure serials on tvb and even remember him as a blackwhite vampire really how many of you guys out there can claim to know thatthough shaolin soccer was not his typical movie it was still a very very enjoyable movie extremely well produced and coherent now that is for the asian version unlucky me i also managed to watch the version released in the us what on earth was that why do they even bother to release it back to kung fu the trailers were superb i remember watching it the first time in my office i burst out laughing at the line where he asked the lady with the spring onion to come out for a fight pure genius and perfect comic timing having watched it like 15 times and still laughing the next trailer was about him getting slapped on the train then the trailer with him satiring shaolin soccer with the line  no more soccer i thought that was incredibly smart at that point i know this is one movie i will pay with my limbs to watchentering the cinema my heart was beating fast and my hands trembling when the butterfly circled around the word kung fu it was almost too overwhelming 3 12 years after watching some bald monks kicking a ball in the opening of shaolin soccer i told myself  this is itroughly 94 minutes later i told myself that is not a chow sing chi movie using my purely unprofessional critical skill this is how i assess what went wrong in the movie in my opinion1 he hardly has much dialogue in the movie let alone funny ones the only funny lines are very much exposed in the trailers his character is also somewhat secondary he just stumbles upon the plot in the beginning and conveniently wraps up the story in the end even his fighting moves is not as extravagant as the others 2 the reason shaolin soccer was so successful was because of the development of the characters coherency in the plot and a fine storytelling skill having crafted some colorful characters in kung fu they are severely underutilized what bother imposing the axe gang as extremely terrifying in the opening scene where in the later parts of the movie they are just onedimensional stereotypical punching bags with clownish head honchos why bother building such a magnificent neighborhood pig sty if you dont bother to exploit more thoroughly in the opening scene its inhabitants were really interesting but sadly just like the building there are not given their much deserved focus even the fatty sidekick were given lines that he couldnt deliver well to get laughters from us except the knife throwing part3 with a running time of 95 minutes the story is chasing after itself at this point im wondering  is it because of the hollywood market the plot may be simple but no emphasis were given to the story telling the ending was so abrupt that it leaves a feeling of disbelief in me everything was going fine and then bam its over reminded me much of king of comedy if more time were given to the audience to grasp all the actions the story would have been more coherent spare some time to show us how sing get his powerrather than explaining it in a few lines have some resolutions to other characters rather than ignoring them completely and then wrap it all up with finale an extra 1o15 minutes would have done the trick4 as much as im impressed with the cgi i ask myself is this how you entice the yankees with star wars and co coming out soon this may be a little risky yuen woping did a great job but it has a somewhat beentheredonethat feelingi cant believe im bashing his movie but this is my sincere opinion though it didnt stopped me from watching it for another 2 times this is to me not a chow sing chi movie but a cgidriven kung fu movie with cameo appearance from himps in an interview later sing admitted that this is not his conventional movie but purely a tribute to the kung fu genre well whatever it is i will still continue to watch his movies bring on the dvds no matter what i just hope it wont take another 3 12 years,comedy
stephen chow in there is so handsome especially when he is fight other bad guys he looked so handsome i had seen it twice it is very very good you will regrate if u dont watch it this movie is excellent best of all movieyou must watch it its quite violent but its very funny of all the movie that i know that he had acted this is the best of all trust me its so nice that i had watched it 2 times i want to watch again but i dont have enough money  you will never regret on spending sd850 on it to watch the movie in cinema  the lollipop given is very yummy its so good that no words could describe it btw the song played when about to end is what song i like it very much if u know can u tell me mail me at joyce1003yahoocomsghope ur will watch it ,comedy
retarded stupid ridiculous awful terriblestupidity doesnt equal funnyi found no redeeming qualities whatsoever with this film from the beginning until the end it was just one stupid scene after anotherwhen it was over i applauded because it was over still seeking to get back the time wastedif you rent this movie make sure to have lots and lots of liquor by your side because perhaps the only way to enjoy it is drunkdo yourself a favor and just say nohelp rid the world of movies like this by not giving your hard earned cash to the people making them,comedy
reviewed by sam osbornrating 15 out of 4a couple years ago a little film called shaolin soccer tripped into theaters after being endlessly shuffled around by distributors the film didnt get around to my area so i rented it out of the godly netflix a few months later i expected a nicely goofy rendition of the typical formula soccer film with some interesting kung fu what i got was a diluted mess of amateur cgi and a screenplay that seemed to be regurgitated from the mind of an infant not much more can be said about chows latest outing its little more than a poor video game concept brought to the big screen with no story halfbaked characters and the stupidest sense of humor this side of barney is one of the most critically overrated films in years that being said some credit must be given to yuen wo ping and sammo hung for their brilliant choreography also it cant go without saying that stephen chow does show some hints of talent among this convoluted disaster he obviously has a sharp eye for visual treats and a creativity that cant be matched but why does he waste it on this high budget low grade comedy i just dont understand if you must know theres some excuse for a plot dumped out by the screenplay in the opening sequence in prerevolution china gangs ruled the land the biggest and most terrible of these gangs was the axe gang original i know this axe gang goes through each town demanding tribute and killing all who refuse with yes axes that is until they stumble upon pigsty alley hidden within pigsty alley are a myriad of kung fu masters all of whom duke it out with a warrior from the axe gang but pigsty alley would be lost if it werent for wait for it the chosen one you get the idea the whole film plays out like one of those fighting games on video game consoles if you havent played one they consist of a short cgi backstory explaining the beef between the two characters then an extended duel of boxing shooting slicing kicking etc after all this is over you do it again essentially pulls the same trick creating cute good guys and diabolic bad guys to duke it out in cgi madness where real prowess in kung fu is certainly not necessary i have a feeling yuen wo ping spent much more of his time choreographing a computer programmer than an actor amidst all this fighting chow crams in his trademark humor this consists of many jokes concerning flatulence male nudity haphazard and silly slapstick and males harassing females its just not funny the humor has been related to that of buster keaton and the greats of the early years of cinema from what ive seen of mr keatons work i think hed cry if he heard that,comedy
comedy doesnt always travel well and i admit that many supposedlyfunny foreign moviesparticularly those from chinahave left me scratching my head in confusion however being a fan of some of stephen chows earlier work and with receiving praise in the west from practically all who have clapped eyes on it i expected this film to have me laughing uncontrollably from start to finishunfortunately it didnt partly because much of kung fu hustles comedy is based on stale decadesold routines borrowed from hollywoods silent comedians and looney tunes cartoons and partly due to the fact that i just didnt understand some of the humour which im guessing is based on cultural references that i am just plain unaware ofthe film also failed to impress me with its martial arts scenes which have been choreographed to within an inch of their lives by wirefu expert yuen woping and then further meddled with by digital artists the result is extremely cartoonish and bound to disappoint those who like me prefer their fight action to be as bonecrunchingly realistic as possible yuen wah one of my favourite kung fu stars is completely wastedas far as i am concerned works best when it enters the realms of pure fantasy such as the scene when three fighters do battle with a pair of evil assassins armed with a magical musical weapon or the bit when when one character uses her incredible vocal powers to defeat the enemy it is these visionary moments that are the most entertaining parts of the film and if there had been more of this kind of stuff and less in the way of silly slapstick id be rating this film a lot higher,comedy
plot outline set in 1940s china the film portrays a young man stephen chow who wants to be a gangster with the notorious axe gang just because being good didnt work for him kfh includes other characters like the protagonists fatlazy sidekick harpplaying killers a frail looking beast a hamlets domineering landlady and her husband and some of the hamlets inhabitants who are all apparently kungfu masters comment kfh is yet another chingi martialarts movie with flying that defies all laws of physics the audience can find some action sequences resembling the burly brawl of matrix revolutions and some dialogues from spiderman one is left wondering whether some of the scenes are to be enjoyed as actionsequences or purecomedyconsidering chows track record of shaolin soccer 2001 he seems to be adept at confusing viewers between action and comedy performances can be rated as decent from the comical angle although sfx is executed neatly the similarities with matrix make it seem exaggerated unlike matrix which was a dream world chinese stuntmen simply dont seem to accept physics can someone explain me why every other guy in a chinese movie is a kungfu master rating 25,comedy
worst film of all time and i include solaris in that i cant see how anyone could possibly like this film oh i occasionally laughed but that was generally in sheer shock at how i let my friends drag me to see it the plot made no sense nuns are funnier and bluntly it was just stupid i would like someone to really explain to me why they liked it i cannot be persuaded i assure you but it would be interesting to hear their reasons personally i would advise anyone who has been unfortunate to buy the dvd to burn it immediately and bury the ashes so future generations will never have the misfortune to witness it,comedy
i would have rated this movie higher if i wasnt so frustrated by the people around me those around me laughed at some parts that i found rather offensive as opposed to comical for example a group of children urinating on another child is not funny it is unsanitary and dehumanizing please do not laugh if you do this is a sure sign that you are not meant to be a parent or work with children  at least not until you find this as upsetting as i did i wish i had rented this movie so i could have watched it at home without this constant nervous giggle surrounding mefor those of you who choose to see this movie be warned that this is not the only part that you may find culturally offensive there is excessive spousal abuse and gay bashing i would warn you about the violence but it is explicit and actually one of the most entertaining parts of the film,comedy
i consider it kung fu  comedy 810 story  even the basic premise of the story is funny 910 visual  not quite crouching tiger but pretty close 1010 action  if you like silly kung fu attacks 610 acting  nothing exceptional neither good nor bad 1010 flow  very smooth  easy to follow 1010 humor  you will laugh until you cry 610 audio  nothing exceptional neither good nor bad 610 predictability  moderately predictable 810 originality  about as creative as kung fu can be 1010 rewatchability  since the humor isnt based on spoken jokes its fun to watch it more than once this is one of my favorite movies if you like a kung fu that is funny you must see this it puts jackie chan movies to shame dont get me wrong i like many of his movies but this one is simply much better the fight scenes in this movie are totally unrealistic but absolutely hilarious,comedy
this hongkong style kungfu parody was quite funny and imaginative it sports an overthetop cartoon feel with lots of great slapstick humor and chopsocking martial arts mayhem although the visual effects should certainly be praised for their dynamism and inventiveness they also looked somewhat fake at times one could argue it works in the context of the film i enjoyed the character actors but wasnt blown away by their acting skills and it was cool to see old hongkong action actors unknown to me kicking butt in such a stylish way the fighting choreographies were amazing with literally unbelievable yet beautiful moves if youre in the right frame of mind and preferably with a bunch of friends this film should be loads of funrating 8 out of 10,comedy
what is there to say about kungfu hustle apart from it being a postmodern explosion of ideas references and conventions stephen chow in this film has taken everything we may associate with the kungfu genre when it comes to large fight scenes and spectacular stunts and has combined it with other ideas by way of the classical hollywood musical americanised kungfu films such as the matrix and equilibrium warner brothers cartons and has even thrown in a pinch worth of a reference to french animation for the overall narrative needless to say kungfu hustle is a breathless and relentless series of scenes that entertain on one level but also captivate on a more appreciative level as people jump leap and pirouette through the air in a series of amazing stuntsim sure everyone likes to go into a film with the mindset that they will get something out of the picture that they can really enjoy and go away with some aim higher than others some like a lot of action maybe a standout performance with others looking to appreciate depthoffield or attention to miseenscene in kungfu hustle its difficult to think of anyone who might not get anything out of the film at all yes kungfu hustle is chock full of fight scenes and yes some may be quick to label it something lower than it is but i think this sort of reaction is somewhat unjust hollywood have churned out some really appalling action films in the last couple of years films like bulletproof monk and charlies angles full throttle  films that more resemble computer games aimed at people who play computer games than anything else but in kungfu hustle the violence or action has a certain aesthetic to it  it is like watching a dance or a ballet it is like being in the front row of a large grand opera with towering sets and a huge casts of extrasone of the reasons i got this feeling is due to the music that plays during one specific scene in which two resident kungfu masters battle against two other hooded hit men  their weapon of choice is a string instrument that with added power of enlightenment can churn out fists and knifes to counteract their opponents the music is of a classical and instrumental variety playing during the fight thus juxtaposing any violence we might think will occur especially when knifes and blades on the end of sticks are introduced into the arena but the emphasis is more on the music the sheer poetic movement of the characters and the slow motion than what weapon theyre using and to distract us enough and to wow us enough for us to focus on these things is an achievement in itselfso the film puts across its violence more so as poetry or as one large dance than a simple action scene with one side over here and one side over there accompanied by nasty rock music blade trinity anyone something else the film does during the mentioned scene is include a reoccurring joke the hardest of all jokes to get right because it is the repetition of the gag that must remain strongest  are people going to laugh more than once at the punch line one characters constant sapping of another to get out of the way acts as a perfect topping to an already delicious scene but the film is delicious as a whole the film is less concerned with actors characters and story lines and more focused on the expansion of ideas and the updating of recent hollywood clichsthe character of the landlady yuen is one of great strength and independence she is also female the fight scenes do not exist to merely entertain an attentionspanless audience but act as a demonstration as to how this can be and should be done in reply to the american films i mentioned the story is straight out of the popular french astrix comics in the sense a much larger organisation or gang the romans the axe gang wants to rule further to do this they must take a much smaller area but have trouble doing so astrixs village and pig sty alley act as this buffer both of which house individuals with strength great enough to repel the forces of evil  the character of sing chow himself will also suffer his epiphany through learning whats right and wrong because of thisthen there are the many references to popular culture through spoofing of road runner and such i see this as chow and china as a whole spoofing and perhaps attempting to ruin pieces of popular american culture just as america cashed in postmatrix with an invasion of horrible hollywood action films such as bulletproof monk et al kungfu hustle takes back the kungfu genre for china the film is one about the expansion and globalisation of a lethal group but along with this it pokes fun at the expansion and americanisation of kungfu as a means of disposable entertainment big clever and very cinematic kungfu hustle is a winner if youre in the mood and even if youre not,comedy
i watched this movie with my cousin over thanksgiving weekend the day after watching the previous movie having seen chows previous film shaolin soccer i went in expecting total lunacy of a humorous sort well thats what i gotin its most inspired moments the film is a ridiculous amalgamation of international pop culture and kung fu film legacy and like the previous film there is a dance numberthe production values of the film are higher than its predecessor but i do have to fault the film for being even more scattershot than the previous work the central supporting characters appear to keep changing focus to the point that you start to wonder whether any of them are really important also the principal protagonist isnt well focused on especially in light of the spotlight thrown onto the various support characters the tone and pace of the film is again manic however the film is unable to effect the sheer lunacy of the previous work as there is no particular building towards the ending the final confrontation is a bit of a deux ex machina and you dont have enough of a meaningful connection with the primary protagonist so when it happens youre left with a bit of a so what responsethe film is enjoyable in the end because of the manic madcap homages and bizarre upturning of filmic conventions but loses cohesiveness due to its inability to focus on the overall story consequently the dramatic tension is flattened similarly to the parodic inventions of the wayans clan and isnt able to make its epic confrontations particularly epicstill if you want to watch a crazy and bizarre kung fu senduphomage this is a good place to go just dont expect anything amazing 710,comedy
this is a good movie but not specifcally for the everyday person it contains a lot of comedy and cannot be taken seriously the majority of the timethis movie pokes fun at and pays homage to kung fu movies at the same time making it a combined power of action and comedy it features a good if not somewhat stereotypical plot about the chosen one who doesnt know about himself and so on the movie makes good use of cgi in a generally comical way and it shows that you dont have to be a musclebound 62 man to be good with kung fu i recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed similar titles such as kung pow enter the fist or even anime like naruto,comedy
ill make it clear from the start that i am not in any way a fan of martial arts movies i bought this movie simply because i saw a trailer for it that really made me laugh out loudi was not in any way disappointed with this film and there were quite a few ocassions when i had a really good chuckle this is quite an achievement in itself because i rarely find anything funny a lot of the movie was quite farfetched but it didnt really matter because it all fitted in very nicely with the mood and atmosphere of the filmthere were some great characters in the film all of the main roles were superb especially the landlady who was constantly smoking cigarettesthe only criticism i really have is that the ending was a little ott even compared with the rest of the film and was extremely farfetchedthis is a film i would recommend to anyone i will definitely be giving it another look soon,comedy
this movie was funny not parody funny it never made fun of itself like say a kung pow but it manages to make you laugh on several occasions throughout the film the story is rather captivating apposed to most other action kung fu movies the story is this a man who wants to join the axe gang because he learns good guys always lose well joins the axe gang only to find that good always wins there are some funny characters like an assassin who dresses like a woman because of years in jail and a lady who screams to attack sindel anyone this is a funny movie thats worth seeing by any comedy or kung fu fana must buy or at least rent,comedy
stephen chow has done a great job since hes starred written and directed the movie prepare to laugh at the funny characters and to have a really good time while watching the fight scenes the actors are good some better than others though the combats are well achieved and exciting and the battlessome reminding of kill bill in what refers to one guy fighting one thousand are sensational the bad guys are evil but with a trifling humorous touch its one of those kind of movies that help you forget about all of your problems and concerns so just forget about everything loosen up and laugh id simply say relax and have a good time,comedy
stephen chows blends martial arts and slapstick comedy into something that is entertaining and leaves you with the sense of satisfaction incredible stunts and kung fu combos give the movie that quality that only comes for a great kung fu movie what this movie does is gives the viewer more of a story not the greatest of plots conceived by a film maker but good enough for this genrethe main character sing chow plays a wannabe member of the notorious axe gang he and his sidekick try to perform amateur tricks on the people but are barely successful until they rob a girls ice cream cart this wasnt the classiest of moves finally they go into the gerti where they get involved with the axe gang and the crazy land lords and their unusual powersthe movie revolves around the coming of the one sound familiar and the search for this one many fighters have unusual and mind boggling powers and when they fightthey fight anything goes from lightning quick speed music that kills and of course the lions roarthis movie exceeded my expectations greatly and created a whole new genre of film kung fu comedy dancing i just wish there were more axe dances,comedy
this genre of kung fu comedy has been lifted to a higher level after several depressing decades of jackie chan movies stephen chow mixes a lot of different martial art violence with humor and great digital effects the main character sings hope to become a member of the axegang is put on many tests without much help from his overweight comrade i hope you enjoy this film as much as i did throw an axe hit my mom in the eye jeez not again go and see this movie right away there hasnt been a better movie since uhm it is the best kung fu comedy ever made and i really think stephen chow has done a great job making this movie worth seeing my mom is really mad now can i please have my axe back fiiijjjjooo chop seetheththefifilm,comedy
this movie confirms another time that asian people are great at making movies it has much to offer fantastic humor you will be laughing lots of times d its hard to explain cause you need to see it  hard to tell in words and its totally different humor then you are used to so dont think it jakie chan movies humor this humor is more special d it also has very good special effects from time to time it will remind you of warner bros if people run very fast itll go like roadrunner etc really great to see this also because of the fantastic special effectsit also has great fighting as you probably could tell from the title   here the special effects look fantastic again the fighting also has some weird stuff in it some freaky fighting styles etc sometimes it has some matrix stuff in it not really the bullet time although it slow downs regularly but its kinda different but more cause of the fast fighting awesome moves etcso if you like fighting movies and want to laugh a whole bunch of time just go and see this movie the chance that you wont like it is very very little,comedy

spoilers throughouti have to start by thanking the imdb reviewers of this movie because they hit it spot on was really good and you do not have to be a longtime fan of the genre to like this while reading many reviews here on imdb i was struck by how many comments there were on the humor in this i was a bit skeptical but they were rightthis movie is funny over the top but funny it also contains some great visuals the action scenes were amazingparticularly at the end and whats more theres still a good solid plot that comes together in the end in a great way and will even give you a little emotional tug this is a movie that definitely had it allit was either this or sin city and im glad i chose it sneaks up on you as well i didnt even realize how into it i was until it went on a bit and i was on the edge of my seat this is very definitely a recommended viewing go with no expectations but to have a good time,comedy
i recently saw this movie and must say it is easily one of my favorite movies of all time if you enjoyed shaolin soccer or any of the other movies chow has put out i would really recommend this flickwhile the film definitely had more in the way of special effects than shaolin or any of his other films for that matter i do not feel that it detracted from the film at all in actuality i feel it greatly added to my enjoyment of the film there was a scene with some musical kung fu masters that was simply amazing and i will leave it at that so as to not ruin for those that have not seen itas with his other comedies the action was quick and light hearted it contained the same cast we have come to know and love in chow films and thats a good thing as they make the movie for me as much as he doesto sum it up if you are looking for a good light hearted and quick actioncomedy and you dont mind a couple of bad translations then this is definitely the movie for you,comedy
its been a fun to watch how stephen chow evolved from a great comedian into a great director after directing the impressive shaolin soccer mr chow even shows more talent with his latest kungfu hustleafter the great success of shaolin soccer mr chow realized that he has capability to make more international film so he must take a three years to complete his latest flick still in a very way of mr chows style but in more retro touch this movie is more like a homage to the kungfu movies from shaw bros era and the taste is good with breathtaking dueling scenes and surprising plot twist the plot is quite simple actually but surpassing as a lame flickif you have a mood to watch kungfu movie watch this flick if you want to watch a decent comedy watch this also if you a die hard fans of stephen chow so this is a must see guarantee to entertains810,comedy
i saw this at a surprise screening during the us comedy arts festival in aspen co while the plot is fairly predictable and the acting extends to sillygoofy at times the film is thoroughly enjoyablei would have left out the subplot with the woman and the lollipop as it brings too much into the film without rounding out this emotional bit but it somehow still works additionally the chubby sidekick is overdone as welli would have like to have seen more traditional kung fu but it was overwhelmed by all the special effortsmy personal favorites are the set and costume design the costumetop hats of the two axes reminds me of the magritte paintingsall in all fun and the misses are forgivable,comedy
stephen chows last project shaolin soccer was a funny and enjoyable and as a result of that i expected to enjoy his next project kungfu hustle i got to say that i was not disappointed with his one so much so that i like this even more than soccer the humour was not over the top like other comedies despite it being in chinese with subtitles did not in anyway deter me from enjoying the movie it really was able to cross both the cultural and lingual barrier which may exist in foreign filmsi particularly loved all the references that were made to famous american movies like the matrix and spiderman they were delivered in a subtle but effective way also despite his rather limited screen time chow made up for it by delivering quality inputs from behind the camera the characters were both lovable and detestable i especially loved the couple who were very ironicoverall a quality followup to ss i cannot wait for his next project,comedy
in comparison to shaolin soccer the only other stephen chow that ive seen comes close but not quite the same qualitymy favorite feature of chows films is the humor the situations he writes into the films along with the other credited writers are strange and hilarious but the plot is the only lacking aspect of the film i think the story was fun and very entertaining but not fulfilling for me of course the special effects and production values were great this time around chow uses lots of effects and the sfx crew does it well the change from real actors to cgi is good and smooth even thought the animation isnt fluent but its a comedy and im not complaining its even comparable the quality of the matrix the acting also is quality some returning actors from shaolin soccer and many new who are charming characters unfortunately the characters are not as in deep or lovable as shaolin soccer especially singchow but the cast and characters stand strong on their own without comparison to chows precious film and with wooping choreographing its looks fast fluent creative and professionaloverall the film is certainly worth ones time but i cannot be the judge you must see it for yourself,comedy
i saw it on vcd  2 discs i bought in chinatown on chinese new year day it is a very enjoyable movie the story is simple and boy does he know how to tell a good old story a good nobody turned bad and finally redeemed himself at the end  a very common theme thats almost always in chows movies some super duper wuxia heroes retired in some remote settings tried to live a normal life only being forced to fight one more final battle  a very common theme in wuxia novels the movie makes some very good references to old cantonese wuxia movies as well as works by jing yong the godfather of wuxia novels all the gong fu or kung fu fight scenes are outrageous and they are outrageously funny and good i am glad i find them enjoyable in my mind gong fu hustle and crouching tiger hidden tiger are probably the only 2 movies that do justices to the wuxia genre,comedy
it seems to me that stephan chows movies are getting better and better is better than shaolin soccer in my opinion due to the fact that im not much of a soccer fan but shaolin soccer had a good story to it storywise kung fu is the typical chow movie but in a good way the cgi was very good at times i couldnt tell the difference between real and fakeafter the movie i was left craving for more of the action scenes from the movie because they looked so damn good especially the first fight i might have given it ten stars if it werent for the fact that the story seemed to have been rushed a little longer more action scenes definitely more chow jokes and this movie should be more of a hit than it already is,comedy
the movie is nothing more than a bunch of unfunny dumbeddown gags gratuitous cruel violence amid uninteresting nonbeautiful martial sequences i had to leave halfway the movie is made deliberately badly which is probably the worst sin i can think of in this business the only reason i gave it 2 and not 1 star is relatively good camera work stay awaycomparison with jackie chun buster keaton or quentin tarantino give this movie way too much credit it does not even qualify as slapstick its a dumb and dumberertype comedyyou have been warned,comedy
as a huge fan of stephen chow and i mean huge as in watched each of his movies at least 50100 times this movie was suppose to be like water in the desert for the thirst of his fanshowever and unfortunately after 3 years of waiting since shaolin soccer i must say that this movie clearly shows stephen has lost the touch he had with shaolin soccer its not quite possible for stephens fans not to compare this movie with his last one especially after such a long period of waiting and the similar special effects that was used in both movies and in comparison this movie seems to follow the tracks of shaolin soccer too much which doesnt give the same excitement surprises and laughtersthe plot of the movie itself leaves many question marks for audiences not only a lot of the parts of the movie doesnt make any sense at all a lot of the scenes were also quite meaningless and useless which could be placed with better scenes to complete the story a lot betterthe music actors sets and the whole movie production itself was quite fabulous and has definitely gone much more international than his precious movies if youre also a fan of stephen chow you can probably tell that this movie has some resemblance of his movies a chinese odyssey where stephen tried to reduce the humor and added more importance towards the music and production as a whole if the movie could reduce the comical effects and emphasize more on the plot like he did in flirting scholar or king of beggars this would be a perfect movie for his first official hollywood movie,comedy
this movie was so bad it hurt my brain the plot made absolutely no sense none at all dont even bother trying to understand whats happening the characters personalities just jump around randomly they dont so much develop as the writers just forget everything and start from scratch every 10 minutes i swear everyone in the film has multiple personality disorderi guess it was supposed to be funny but well it wasnt there was a lot of goofy slapstick humor and that was it ive never been a fan of slapstick myself but this was poor even for the genre not to mention there were elements which were decidedly not funny like when a bunch of bullys beat up a little deaf mute girl then beat up and pee all over the face of her would be rescuer that isnt funny it isnt made to be funny but it doesnt go on to illustrate any moral or other meaning either its just sort of there for no reason messing up the already horrid flow of the movietheres a lot of horrible cgi effects every couple seconds and a ton of matrix on a budget fight scenes im not sure how long it actually was but it seemed like it went on forever i kept thinking it was about to end and it would take another random plot twist i saw the dubbed version and while i would normally never judge anything by the dubbed version i dont see how this train wreck could possibly be improved upon a 78 seriously i give this movie a 2 and thats only because i felt bad for the ice cream girl,comedy
ok so weve all heard the positive comments and votes here on imdb about this film now i am going to contradict them with my review of firstly the dubbing is terrible i dont speak chinese so i watched it in english words are said ages after lip movement and scene directions some reviews have praised this as part of the humour i find it annoying and poor direction in the making of the film secondly while i have mentioned humour lets discuss itwell thats it there is none maybe its something that is lost on me but an old woman running around with her legs moving as fast as roadrunner in the warner brothers cartoons just doesnt strike me as amusing thirdly the special effects are dreadful how many more oriental films do we have to watch with actors flying around on wires it was overused in crouching tiger then again in house of flying daggers this film uses the same tricks of the trade but does it more and more which makes it lose any credibility it had left lastly the script is unbelievably bad besides the lack of humour the action does nothing to make the film entertaining be it from ghost samurai warriors flying out of a gigantic violin type weapons to the old roadrunner lady retaliating with one of her own from her constantly cigarette filled mouth the indestructible bad guy that acts like a toad to the hero flying around with a hand of fire ready to burn that toad the film lacks any logic or sense throughout no need to elaborate any further the film stinks and it strikes me as bewildering that it is rated so highly,comedy
i can understand why people find slap stick comedy and the like amusing but where exactly does come in this world of categorisation that we are living in for me  the unwatchable seems suitableit is a struggle at times to tell when the director has decided to take the film seriously or when he is attempting to put across his warped perception of comedy there has been a wave of popularity toward film from asia and films such as flying daggers are deserving of such attention this however appears to be an attempt to grab viewers while foreign cinema is thriving because i for one cant see any other reason why one would pay good money to see dreadful,comedy
everyone always wonders how some movies gain such acclaim i wondered myself rated so high by imdb users seems to be the best now i ask the question of why does this suck so bad is just awful i saw this movie for free and i still feel ripped off the story is that a group of gangsters called the ax gang are running a muck till they make their way to a city that stands up all of the villagers are 100 unlikeable all of the bad guys are lame too the concept of martial arts and cartoon mayhem is done very poorly if this was a tale of a one man to fight the bad guys alone this might have been good it is not this is just a really stupid movie this was so bad that i flipped the channel after forty minutes i could not take this anymore what an awful movie even while wasted this still sucks thats terrible one last thing i could have been much better off without seeing some guys ass too i just kept on saying pull up your pants you douche you will know what im talking aboutthe last word painful,comedy
i can start by admitting that asian comedy has never really appealed to me i dont know if its the fact that their sense of humor is so different to the one i have anyway i decided to give this a try after hearing many good things about itthe plot revolves around a poor neighborhood trying to defend themselves from a gangster organization their best defense is the kungfu masters living there but when the gangsters bring in reinforcements someone else has to step upthe plot doesnt make much sense at all the first twenty minutes i didnt understand at all what was going on but soon enough it doesnt matter really if there is one thing i do not expect from asian comedy it is an intelligible plot rather soon the movie goes into a higher gear becoming more fastpaced its not difficult to see that its wooping yuen that did the fight choreography in some parts its quite similar to the matrix reloaded with mass scenes one protagonist fighting of dozens of opponents whether you like his style or not is up to you myself i prefer a more realistic touch but the wire work and choreography is topnotch here all in all its nicely donethe comedy itself ranges from poor to rather funny the thing that works best is the more physical jokes like the sometimes hilarious fight sequences this is not for everyone though and i still keep my reservations about asian comedy this movie has not convinced me otherwise i enjoyed it but i doubt ill watch it again for people who know that they like the asian brand of comedy though this is well worth watching its one of the best ive seen in the genre i rate it 510 but with reservations for personal taste being what it is,comedy
star rating  unmissable  very good  okay  you could go out for a meal instead  avoid at all costs a couple of partners who aspire to join the notorious axe gang that terrorizes china in the 1940s come into conflict with the residents of pig sty a small village in the city as events progress the one discovers his humanity again and takes on the gang as well as a new recruit who mastered kung fu to such an extent he went insane and ended up in a mental asylumtheres been a regeneration lately of the kung fu genre with the likes of shaolin soccer and ong bak and this latest entry tries to spin a comedic twist on iti found the plot really sloppy and hard to follow even for such a film as for all the breathtaking stunts in comparison to ong bak which i saw only a short while ago they look really unbelievable and strings assisted the relentless onslaught of them began to wear me down after a bit a lot of the audience i was sitting watching it with seemed to find it all very funny and maybe it just caught me on a bad day but this attempt to add a comedic twist on the genre just didnt appeal to me ,comedy
only from steven chow do we get a martial arts  comedy with references to shaw brother films from the 70s bruce lee ray harryhausen wile e coyote and road runner matrix reloaded and spiderman the film is which had its world premiere at the 29th toronto international film festival the film opens in japan on january 15 2005 and will unspool in other countries thereafter the film centers around the exploits of a wannabe tough guy chow who unwittingly gets involved in a conflict between the notorious axe gang and residents of a housing project thats pretty much all the plot detail you need as the film is stuffed with wacky bits of slapstick humour and martial arts loosely choreography by sammo hung yuen woo ping and cg artisansill be the first to admit that i just do not get steven chows brand of comedy i did watch shaolin soccer for what seems like several years ago and found it to be just okay the good news is that i enjoyed abit more but not by much the audience around my friends and i however truly and absolutely loved the film i sat there and perhaps chuckled a few times but found myself thinking about the magnificence that is the house of flying daggers which i saw a few days agodespite my cool reception to i have no doubt this film will be an enormous boxoffice smash in many parts of asia if you love steven chow films then will have you grinning well after the final credits scroll past the screen,comedy
is much more polished and flashy than shaolin soccer but it isnt even half as inspired or spirited it is too busy with paying homages to find a face of its own the comedy story and characters dont feel fresh and come off as rather artificial and forced moreover the usage of cg feels really excessive looks like stephen chow has succumbed to the hollywood trend of using cg for its own sake even if it doesnt really serve the movie anyway im sure most people will like it since its right in line with hollywood blockbuster flashiness while maintaining a bit of chinese wackiness but i for one felt very disappointed,comedy
after watching kungfu hustle in its entirety i am left with very little words while not being a slapstick comedy from beginning to end im not really entirely sure what to think of the movie its my first steven chow film but even in that i find it very difficult to talk about the intensely silly filmtaking us back to 1940s china hustle revolves around sing you never really hear his name but you learn early on that he just wants to be accepted he tried fighting for the good but has decided that its not paying off so he wants to be bad and join the infamous axe gang they control most of china except for the poor slums after a chance encounter with an obnoxious landlady sing starts off a turf war that can only end with one group falling to the other but neither wants to back downbasically thats the plot of kungfu hustle nothing imaginary by any means but a lot of the zany fight sequences are just that zany the quote on the front about it being a cross between looney tunes and kill bill really wasnt a lie there are more than a few scenes of about 5060 guys in black suits surrounding one person to come and kill them and on more than a dozen occasions the silliness of the film rules out and it becomes somewhat of its own looney tunes reality joke chow is fairly good in his role as is everyone else who steal his spotlightbut the thing i found the most interesting about the picture was the art direction 1940s china looks absolutely gorgeous from the setpieces to the vivid colours i was amazed at how excellently the backdrops were created for the film from the costumes to the buildings to even all the little random objects it all screams nostalgia and screams of being excellent the cinematography is not all too bad eitherif there was anything to say against the film it was the fact that none of the characters are really well explored there are no signs of showing why sing feels the way he does except for one silly flashback scene even when a pivotal character shows up so pivotal in fact she has all the 10 minutes of screen time and zero lines his motivations are never really explained well enough and he just seems to be fighting randomly same goes for everyone else there was mention of a son by the landlady and lord yet never explained for its significance later onits moments like these where i know i should just enjoy it for what it is but the fact that key parts of the films writing is missing really does not help the film710,comedy
many of the asiatic films which reach west lacks humor and self irony here is a movie which really tries to compensate and the audience is laughing and they laugh at the right spotsbut the humor is obviously created to please westerners and sell and it is often rather funny there is great mocking about kung fu and also about the deep intelligent quotes that kung fu heroes sometimes give usbut still this is really nothing more than funnier and more intelligent monty python sketches including some buddha jokes you can still have the objections you often have towards these movies the violence pain and evil is objectified it becomes comedy but is that thinking really funny,comedy
this movie is the most overrated i have seen in a long time this movie reminds me about the bad movies from the 80s it is mildly funny seemingly based mostly on material from other movies it tries to combine comedy action tragedy and most other genres im not against such combinations in general but there must be at least something good that comes out of it in this case the result is below average in all fields it is not a good kungfu movie it is not a good comedy it is not a good action it is not a good chinese movie it is also very predictable on the basic level if you didnt laugh once in the first 10 minutes of the movie you will probably not laugh during the rest of the movie,comedy
tells the story of an epic battle between the miscellaneous inhabitants of a slum and the organised city gangsters an uneasy truce is broken by the actions of a wannabe gangster and his sidekick but the conflict escalates out of control until it becomes a battle for honour pride and survival represents stephen chows second mainstream directorial project and the first one to break in to the western market its distribution success happened off the back of wordofmouth acclaim for his earlier film shaolin soccer unfortunately where the latter was hilarious hustle falls dreadfully wideofthemark on almost every gag i only found one joke in the whole film genuinely funny a scene involving some extremely inept knifethrowing almost as though the filmmakers knew the jokes were failing they attempted to fill the gap with cgi sadly this only serves to emphasise how much the film is lacking in other areas the cgi is of itself quite impressive but it forms far too much of a role here to serve merely as a storytelling tool the plot is incoherent and comprises nothing more than a seemingly endless string of fight sequences that would largely have benefited from more attention to choreography and far less to cgi by the end of the film i was pondering how to get back the 95 minutes of my life that had been wasted watching the least entertaining martial arts film ive seen in years,comedy
the basic problem with the entire film is that it tries to outdo shaolin soccer in this it fails the reason it fails is one simple reason originality most american films fail miserably because they try to copy a successful formula from before what you end up with is a copy and an inferior one at that some scenes i felt were copied from 1 gangs of new york 2 warner brothers cartoons most notably road runner 3 the mask 4 it happened one night 5 the matrix reloaded and the matrix 6 spiderman probably more but i didnt watch the originals i am fairly certain some of the jokes came out of charlie chaplin harold lloyd and the three stooges the affect this had on me was deep disappointment and disgust the funniest parts in shaolin soccer were original and i felt actually outtakes that made it into the final film they took chances with original situations and even though not 100 successful were interesting nonetheless in their daring this feeling was made even stronger because of the great fight sequences this is one of those movies to me where i will probably memorize the time counter for the fight scenes and ignore everything else there are 4 fight sequences the first is fairly traditional the 2nd is more cgi yet effective the third is a good balance between cgi and action but the fourth is almost total cgi which features one of the most powerful in kung fu film history fighting styles in the most boring way ie the mighty toad style if they had added a few minutes to the film they could have had a much better product simply by making more characters three dimensional rather than flat in the small village many great fighters chose to live in anonimity trying to retire from kung fu why out of the 5 great masters in the village only 2 refer to a specific event in the past although no details surrounding the event and another can be guessed at otherwise there is no information at all about why each person chose to live in hiding but going back to the fight sequences i hate fighting styles where the move is very dumb yet supposedly powerful this movie features many of these including the lions roar buddha palm from heaven the amplified lions roar toad head butt etc etc etc although i will say this is marginally better than having them announce the move before attacking as in old run run shaw films this film became a crappy cgi fest however several of the fight scenes were very well done i really enjoy the manyvsfew fight when the few enter the fight onebyone after making a moral decision eg the first fighter is almost swarmed and the next guy jumps in just in time etc etc other than the fights and the unoriginality the underlying story was pretty good basically its about a guy who wanted to be a hero but in his first time out gets beaten badly and is convinced that being bad is the only way to win but a girl makes him see the truth plus hes a miserable failure as a bad guy i think overall that this film was sabotaged by the incredible shaolin soccer shaolin soccer set the bar too high on cgisupport in fight scenes and original comedy hopefully stephen chow will realize that the best way to make good comedy is character and situation not formulae,comedy
kfh uses the same gymnastic spectacle atmospheric sets and masterly photography as many recent chinese hits but replaces selfconscious artiness and romance with popeyestyle schlock the story doesnt even try to be coherent and is nothing more than a device for stringing together contrived set pieces and laboured jokes the result is ultimately boring as for levitating combatants and gangster mobs who politely avoid attacking from behind preferring to wait until the hero gets round to systematically duffing them up from in front  enough already its time for hong kong hollywood to take a back seat and give us real stories real actors and real china,comedy
i was very much looking forward to seeing this movie as it did so well in the hong kong film awards the idea of a comedyaction movie seemed very appealingunfortunately i didnt find this film to be very funny i think this is perhaps a difference in cultural sensibilities im sure there are american comedies that leave the chinese clueless and i was clueless with most of the humor of kung fu hustleat the end the focus shifts more to action and i enjoyed it much better at that point id like to say that the voters of the hong kong film awards dont know what theyre talking about but then again i say that just about every year when the oscars pick the socalled best films of the year,comedy
i just saw this on dvd and now i know why i avoid kung fu moviesthis was the biggest load of shite i have ever seen and a complete waste of my moneyi knew the acting was going to be bad because it is a chinese production  but how this lot ever got paid for doing any of this is beyond mei tried to see some humour in it i even laughed a couple of times mainly at the character who wore the cowboy suitimagination was lost in this move some of the fighting was oksorry but this has put me off watching kung fu movies for life movies like this should be banned from reaching our screens,comedy
this movie was not worth my 550 and it shouldnt be worth yours it had a few funny parts but how much is funny worth to you if you are one that would like to see it wait til videoi would advise you to see it if you like comedies but not at full price i have never walked out of a movie and this one isnt that bad to do that i dont know what people of hong kong think is funny but americathis aint too funny this should be rated an action flick more than funny with the action rating the comedy would be funnier because you wouldnt be expecting itwait til video and you will be happier and then you will thank me,comedy
unlike many seems to me i kinda disliked this piece expected a lotta more since all the media has pushed for never seen beforebest everbuster keatonbruce lee etc sorry guys to those who want to hear some recrimination watch the hero divide it by 3 add some comicsjap humor youll be susceptible to understand the first 10 minutes the bedrock requirement is missing no fun if i start to question ideasscenes no flouting better than the last samurai at least but i have to rebuff all wooing thoughts this is no more than a visionary cartoon with real actors or a very unique style i am for the previous,comedy
may leave you feeling a little ripped offwell its been about a week since attending a special press screening for and unfortunately i still feel as if ive been ripped off maybe i just expected too much from this movie due to all of the talent that was involved both in front of the camera and behind the scenesthis may explain why rather than feeling totally satisfied in seeing an entertaining spoof on classic hong kong cinema with a 2005 twist i have nothing but questionsif this is supposed to be a comedy then why am i not laughing that muchis it be possible that most of the witty dialogue was lost in translation from its original language to subtitlesdid fall victim to additional editing by sony pictures entertainment so that they could cram more showings of this film into their affiliated multiplexesif so could this be the reason why sony changed the title from gong fu its original 2004 name to kung fu hustlei have so many more questions am i just being a bit too criticalperhaps i am just being too critical basically is the simple story of a small time thief named sing played by stephen chow who believes that becoming a member of a ruthless ax wielding gang will finally give him happiness of course this is not the lesson that you should to walk away with so our once good guy turned bad must defeat his past and present demons and become a good guy once againvisually this movie is quite entertaining even though at times the computer generation seems to slightly take away from the fight choreography of yuen wo ping kill bill the matrix crouching tiger and sammo hung the medallion knock off double team however dragon ball z fans will definitely get a kick no pun intended out of the final battle between sing and the beast played by leung siu lungone thing for sure this movie is now sending me on a quest to learn cantonese and find its original 2004 version gong fu to see if there was any additional character development that may have been excluded from this releaseso look forward to a follow up review in the near future favorite super power landladys lion roarjames lane hotindienewscom,comedy
i saw at the ziegfeld theater in nyc premiere today and for the most part it was entertaining good action ok story and lots of laughs stephen chow even made an appearance he said  let me not waste any more of your time i hope you enjoy the movie so it was cool that he showed up now back to the movie it is funnier then shaolin soccer and of course the action was done well theater was cracking up on a couple parts and so was i cool characters neat story over all i rate it a 6 out of 10 if youre into this kind of film i guess youll like it more as for me im not a huge fan but it was worth my time stephen choe keep up the good work,comedy
i was not impressed at all by this movie it was presented as being comic and full of bizarre fighting action i guess you have to be a real fan of this genre to enjoy this movie i bored myself to death in the cinema the humor is very childish the characters are blunt and irritating the plot andor story are of no relevance at all its all about the fighting moves i cannot say if there good or not because i dont often go to this kind of movie and after watching this one ill doubt if im going again dont get me wrong im a big fan of the jackie chan movies the fighting scenes are much more comic and jacky has a wellordened wellmeanured character,comedy
i missed the stephen chow movies of old before his forays into the us market with shaolin soccer and now kungfu hustle where his movies were inane slapstick and filled with witty dialogue that entirely made no sensebut dont misread me im not saying that this flick is no good there are classic chow moments but somehow i feel that they aint enough the kungfu and its effects remind you of the matrix trilogy with its bullet time effects and even axe gang members and fight scenes that resemble the burly brawl no surprise though as the fight choreographer is yuen wo pingcharacter development like all chow movies are zilch and cartoony and the female lead in this film although vavavoom is classic flower vase material and she doesnt even say anything hows that put your brains at the door and youll have an entertaining time,comedy
i saw this film late after everyone else in hong kong had raved about it but the general gist of comments from the initial release was that it wasnt as funny as shaolin soccer but it was a far more visually attractive movieso someone gave me the vcd and i was expecting lush 30s shanghai scenes a la wong kar wai with moody 30s music and some laughswell it did that sort ofi suppose if one is to fully appreciate the film then one must view it through hong kong slapstick mode comedic lenses personally i favour more subtle humour like the recent life aquatic where the humour is much more understatedwhich is not to say that the film is not funny it is but i have always found that mr chows main strength in comedy has been in the brilliant cantonese dialogue he manages to conjure up in his films there is less of this in kfh where most of the laughs were slapstick gags but there were one or two moments which were really quite good like the shining reference for examplefinally  cgi while the hk movie industry has increasingly employed the use of cgi in movies chow being one of the pioneers the cgi effects in this film were totally over the top i felt myself consciously trying to suspend disbelief throughout and the roadrunner sequence i felt just broke the whole rhythm of the movie and i found myself squirming in my seat if only they could tone down the cgi make the fight sequences more realistic either using higher quality cgi or just make it less bizarre then it might have been more palatablein summary this is a film which promised a stylish action comedy aimed probably at a more western audience but ultimately fell short due to an almost looney tunes type quality but understandably it is difficult to satiate all tastes when it comes to comedy and by leaving the more comfortable territory of traditional hk humour the films shortcomings may have been due to mr chow stepping into a somewhat unfamiliar territory of higher budget comedy films whilst simultaneously trying to cater to different audiencesa brave step which should be applauded and i look forward to the next film,comedy
i am known for my eclectic taste and a good sense of humour but this movie left me totally cold i watched it for an hour thinking perhaps i will get into it but though i did not hate it i just felt unable to suspend my disbelief perhaps one needs to see it in a cinema where everyone enjoys that sense of shared enjoyment but funny is funny whether you are alone or not  and this movie was not funny it does have mildly entertaining characters the landlady is one but overall i hardly smiled let alone laughed kung fu has never appealed to me but my daughter raved about this movie so i gave it a go what a complete disappointment that an obviously talented director wastes time with this piffle i see now where tarantino gets his inspirationi have to say i enjoyed kill bill more than i thought i would and certainly more than this the special effects in were excellent and i cannot fault the production values but it was imho a waste of time and talenti have not read every post on this site but i would love to know the average ageor iq of the people who love this movie,comedy
im really not a fan of these types of movies the plot was so weak i could barely identify it until the end and it was just too overthetop for me to enjoy it much,comedy
first of allthis movie is not natural with powerful scenariostephen chow can not speak any english at all who is worse than jackie chan in movie he did know what is the acquisition of audience and he is first time to direct a movie by himself second this movie has a simple story in a word fighting is the important scenariothismovie does not reflect the real life of shanghai at the end almost my classmate hate it this movie cheats usit looks like a awful cartoon movie with computer skills actually stephen chow is a local comedy actor however he can not direct a good movie by his heart only he can live and work in hong kong all his life because he can not speak english who has less knowledge,comedy
maybe you have to be stoned to enjoy this movie entirely but i wasnt and i didnt get any serious laughs and wasnt sucked into it at all this movie definitely tries to be cult but the attempt is tiring and unsuccessful the kung fu scenes are pretty dull and the effects are too obvious further i didnt enjoy the twists and turns of the plot that dont make sense and couldve been done way better several scenes were funny the acting was more than half descent there were some touchy scenes and overall it feels like this movie is a great miss rather than a great his no good trait of the movie makes it worth watching i dont know how it got so many good comments but i felt like i had to put out a fair warning regarding my own experience if i were me several days ago id go see something else,comedy
the movie begins on a great note in the first half the action sequences are breathtaking and the comedy scenes are well executedeach of the characters be it the landlord the tailor the potter and the cook just to name a few live up to the expectations dialogues from spiderman and sequence from batman add to the spice an interesting part is where the killer musicians make entryhowever the latter half drags nothing is been told about stephens suddenly unearthed  powerfor that matter the role of the axe leader looks diminishedthe final fight is good but meets with a sad ending in shorta very sad ending to a promising beginning,comedy
this film simply lacked the funniness of other much better steven chow films like shaolin soccer in shaolin soccer the cgi was used to good comic effect whereas kungfu hustle uses them more in the cool and dazzling aspect of an action film in fact i would say that this film really is more of an action film than comedy the funny parts were too far and few between and the over the top action was the centerpieceon top of that the story lacks cohesiveness maybe this was intended to be spoofing other kungfu films tendency to wander but it simply came off as more of the sameoverall though there were good action sequences and chow had two funny scenes too bad it didnt carry through,comedy
plot outline set in 1940s china the film portrays a young man stephen chow who wants to be a gangster with the notorious axe gang just because being good didnt work for him kfh includes other characters like the protagonists fatlazy sidekick harpplaying killers a frail looking beast a hamlets domineering landlady and her husband and some of the hamlets inhabitants who are all apparently kungfu masters comment kfh is yet another chingi martialarts movie with flying that defies all laws of physics the audience can find some action sequences resembling the burly brawl of matrix revolutions and some dialogues from spiderman one is left wondering whether some of the scenes are to be enjoyed as actionsequences or purecomedyconsidering chows track record of shaolin soccer 2001 he seems to be adept at confusing viewers between action and comedy performances can be rated as decent from the comical angle although sfx is executed neatly the similarities with matrix make it seem exaggerated unlike matrix which was a dream world chinese stuntmen simply dont seem to accept physics can someone explain me why every other guy in a chinese movie is a kungfu master rating 25,comedy
the movie itself presents very good quality in terms of costumes special effects and scenarios it is very nice how china and people living styles is presented unfortunately even though it is indeed a fun movie the story gets too monotonous after perhaps the first 40 minutes but the first 40 minutes are pretty good and specially some fighting scenes with the 3 kung fu masters unfortunately i cant say i enjoyed the rest of the movie in the same way if you dont mind about the quality of the story or watching the same thing for about an hour with you should definitively give it a try if not its better to watch something else i would never watch this movie again,comedy
i just dont understand the fuss i grew up on martial arts films so i know a good one when i see one i dont know maybe i was spoilt as a kid by having the benefit of the three dragons making movies to a niche market in an era when word of mouth and not social media drove cinematic entertainment i had to turn this off after 20 minutes it doesnt compare with anything from the 70s up to todays films like ip man the humoursif you can call it that with a serious face derived from racist stereotypes if you love bruce lee jackie chan the three dragons or any half decent chinese kung fu movies going back to late 70s give this a miss even the out there chinese vampire movies are better than this nonsense its poor im putting operation condor or project a on i need therapy after subjecting myself to that ,comedy
this film is a semi homage and half mockery of all kung fu movies and as such i found it didnt mix well are you supposed to laugh its not that funny and the few laughs that are genuine are usually undercut by some extreme violence that jars with the humourare you supposed to enjoy the kung fu fights they werent that spectacular most of the fights were inforced with elements of special effects which takes away from the fact that this is kung fu its hard to think that a fight is amazing when its so obviously cgiso youre not exactly wowed by amazing fight scenes most of which were pretty repetitive anyway with some poor choreography that made most of the fights look slightly messyof course hustle is meant to be cartoony which is fine and the special effects are pretty amazing but the film never struck the correct balance between action and comedythe storyline is basic fodder two chancer want to join the axe gang who want to get revenge on a peasant village usual revenge story ensues with an underdog hero the film trudges along without the use of a plot in most cases just fight after fight and gets repetitiveof course stephen chow is pretty good but hes better as a serious actor come on chow youve got better stuff in youthe extras are pretty worthwhile a made for tv making of is decent and an interview with chow quite informative and funny outtakes were pointless as were the superfluous deleted scenes but it rounded the package off,comedy
i have a vague recollection of seeing parts of this film before maybe after a few beers one night needless to say my attention wasnt fully focused on the screen so it was nice to sit down sober and watch it in its entirety a very enjoyable film with some great comedic moments excellent cgi and some tremendous fight sequences but more of that later heres a brief summary first summary haters please ignore the next paragraphits shanghai in the 1940s competing gangs run the city and the most powerful is the axe gang led by brother sum only very poor neighbourhoods escape the gangs and one of these is pig sty alley a housing complex run by a crazy landlord and landlady sing and his sidekick bone have ambitions to join the axe gang and one day they turn up in the alley posing as axe gang members and start some trouble this comes to the attention of the real axe gang and they intervene unknown to them living amongst the downandouts in the alley are three former kung fu masters who defend their turf with great zeal brother sum seeking revenge employs two assassins who are ultimately defeated by these three and another two other rather unexpected kung fu masters now quite furious brother sum allows sing a skilled lockpick to join the gang and sends him to spring the ultimate assassin the beast out of jail we are now all set for the big showdown but sing still has a part to play in the outcomei really enjoyed this film even the subtitles didnt detract too much from the action on the screen the film has a comicbook style which although it relies quite heavily on cgi is brought about more by the script the set design and the actors than the computer generated visuals great performances all round particularly from stephen chow as sing qiu yuen as the landlady wah yuen as the landlord kwokkwan chan as brother sum zhi hua dong as donut and siulung leung as the beastthere are some great comic moments and many plot twists that take the audience on quite a journey you never quite know just what is going to happen next if i have a criticism its that the fight scenes did drag on a little bit too long but apart from that a very entertaining film its one that left me with a smile on my face and thats always a good sign i would certainly watch it again and so its highly recommendedmy score 8110,comedy
well if you like me enjoy these flicks where its possible for one good guy to kick the bejeezus out of a hundred bad guys all at once then this is the one for you not only that but its got just enough nonsensical dialog to seem brilliant stuff like the good cannot coexist with the bad you cant escape your destiny then theres the one lifted right from stan lees spiderman  in great power lies great responsibility come on that one should have been attributed to the web slinger i cant really say though if youve seen one kungfu film youve seen them all this one goes for laughs along with its action and it hooks you right from the start with that rhythmic axe gang dance  very cool theres some other original stuff here too at least for me i dont watch a lot of martial art movies like the lions roar amplified through a makeshift speaker and the beasts use of the toad style from the kwan lun school flaming buddhist palm also looked pretty interesting i might have to try that some timebest move of the picture  the beast stops the bullet to his head with the two finger technique  in the world of kungfu speed defines the winner my favorite scene just for the surreal beauty of it was sing stephen chow threatening ice cream girl under the top hat poster fred astaire and ginger rogers would have been great in a karate flick dont you thinkas twelve kicks iron fist and the hexagon staff would attest  its no crime to be good at kungfu but the best line of the picture epitomizes sing  i was studying to be a doctor or lawyer but this was world peace and so the world would be saved once again or at least the world consisting of pig sty alley,comedy
is an actioncomedy kungfu movie from hong kong born director stephen chow it is set in 1940s china during a time of political strife gangs are running rampant throughout the many districts and the axe gang is the most feared of them all the only districts that are safe are the poorest ones because the gangs have little interest in them it is a story of survival against the wicked axe gang as they terrorize a poor village all because they were humiliated once by the three kungfu masters that live in said village stephen chow plays the shaggy and unkempt sing whose only wish is the be one of the bad guys and join the axe gang he does so by posing as an axe gang member with his friend bone lam chi chung who attempt to terrorize the village in which the story is centered around this of course all ends in disaster and sparks two stories one following sings quest to join the axe gang and the villages war with the axe gangwhile has a story that keeps you interested it is the incredibly over the top action that makes this film one of the most entertaining ive ever seen it is very campy and cheesy but it is all intentional the fight sequences are very memorable and they will keep you guessing at what insane heights the movie will reach to next it is an ingenious blend of comedy and kung fu action that constantly keeps you wanting more you should not get bored of this film it never lets up with the ridiculous action every fight sequence is different and every single one will wow you to an endless extent im not one for a movie that puts story to the wayside and lets the action take over and somehow manages to avoid that the story is always there no matter how simple it might be everything this movie accomplishes is so beautifully blended together that it amazes and mystifies all the while keeping you laughing hysterically at how over the top everything about it isis ridiculously fun entertainment at its best if you want something different that youve never seen the likes of before then this movie is for you,comedy
a young man and his friend try to join the notorious axe gang but in doing so they need to do some pretty nasty things through a series of unfortunate events the axe gang stumble upon this place called pig stye alley and they cause chaos for the people who live there this causes kung fu masters who live there to reveal themselves and begin a war the young man sing nearly dies during a battle and is reborn as a kung fu master who must fight the evil one known as the beasti saw shaolin soccer and was surprised by how much i loved that film it had soccer kung fu great comedy and hilarious off the wall moments that would never happen outside of the world created in the film chow has taken this concept to the next level with a brilliantly funny and ass kicking kung fu film the quotes about the film are true it really is a kill bill meets looney tunes flick chow is sing the lead character who wants to be really bad he has trouble doing this because he is horrible at it it all stemmed from a troubling childhood in which he was sold some wacky looking kung fu manual which made him think he knew kung fu when he sees a young deaf mute girl being picked on he tries to use his kung fu to help her oops he gets his butt kicked and then he gets urinated on hows that for humiliation now that hes older he thinks the only way to get things in life is if you take them by force so he joins the axe gang but has a battle of conscience and is nearly killed this unleashes his kung fu skills and then the poop hits the fanthe film is off the wall wacky fun the kung fu in the film is really well choreographed and with the added use of funny cgi it takes the film to another level of entertainment chow uses numerous references in his film from kill bill to the matrix to the shining its fun to spot them here and there the film never feels like its cheating or copying others its definitely its own unique film it just knows where its inspirations are i cant recommend this one enough it has numerous rewatch capabilities i find myself watching it every time it is on television if youre a fan of chow and shaolin soccer manages to outdo its predecessor it might take some people a moment or two to get use to the animated style used in the film it is very bugs bunnyroad runner go in with the right expectations and you will have fun,comedy
stephen chow an up and coming actor director who gives us this amazing film of style against style a movie about a buffoon chow who wants to join a gang but must prove himself relentlessly in his groveling for a position in the ax gang they give him a test and have him break out one of the most dangerous man alive a monk who masters a few techniques which makes him a formidable opponent yet in the midst of this new development our up and coming hero chow is nearly beaten to death for his betrayal to the ax gang now under the care of two people who also holds very unique art forms in fighting heals his wounds soon the hero chow discovers a secret which has not been seen in nearly a thousand years the buddhist palm strike this film has every ingredient for the kung fu fans and comedy fans stephen chow did a wonderful job in creating an eye catching butt kicking martial arts display which has overtones of enunciated kicks and punches a great fun film,comedy
first things first this movie is not realistic it was never meant to be i doubt the whole kungfu genre requires realism to work so please stop nitpicking about this factoris a fresh and original film which revitalises both the comedy and action genre their is an almost perfect balance between the two genres at one side of the spectrum you have witty tongue in cheek and slapstick but on the other side their are well constructed fight scenes which breathe new life into kung fu moviesas goofy as the visuals appear in the film the plot is well constructed and focuses through a variety of character development all characters are full of life from the dominant land lady to the oppressive gang leaderin conclusion this film has a perfect balance between comedy and action as none of the separate genres destroy the other ones mood some of the fight scenes may be considered a little too goofy for some viewers but apart from this is a good film yes it is silly and unrealistic but this is used to almost satire other kung fu filmsthe comedy and action unify as well as the ying yang in this funny thriller,comedy
first off i hate dubbed foreign films id much rather be reading several lines at the bottom of the screen than watching the lips of an actor move out of sync with whats being said i just find it annoying and pretty offputting i tried to get past it thoughthe trailer makes it look like pretty much any other martial arts movie in that sense its wildly misleading doesnt really have a strong story but the story it does have doesnt particularly matter too much its all about the visuals and the hilarityits pretty brilliant though it manages to be quite violent and stupidly hilarious at the same time the films opening manages to include crime gangs amputation and dancing all within the first two minutesit doesnt really take itself too seriously and the landlady is a brilliant piece of casting shes may be the funniest thing in this movie the chase sequence between her and sing is both hilarious and amazing the cgi is pretty great too although some of it is done awfully for comedic effect like sings swollen lipsit even manages to spoof spiderman by quoting with great power comes great responsibility i love the scene with the string instrument its so ridiculously stupid and yet extremely clever and entertaining that they use sonic waves as a weapon one of the best scenesi was extremely tired when i watched but it managed to keep me entertained all the way to the end despite the fact that the dubbing was a real problem for mehttpukmoretk,comedy
kung fu producer director writer and star stephen chow brings a stylized and exaggerated element to that undoubtedly reaches out to a western audience the film is an homage to decades of kung fu movie history but it embraces cgi and moves beyond traditional fight choreographyin the film a wannabe chinese gangster played by chow gets the slum where he lives in trouble with the notorious axe gang think the kill bill crazy 88s with hatchets by posing as an axe gang member to fend off the axe gang several villagers from the slum turn out to be kung fu masters even the fat landlady and her bumbling husband the axe gang retaliates by hiring seasoned killers to take them outis comical and action heavy often times even comically actionheavy it isnt violent in the kill bill sense but nearly in the cartoonish sense with characters chasing each other and their legs gyrating like the roadrunner chow brings that cheesy 70s kung fu sense of humor and mixes it in with the special effects martial arts of todays era theres as much slow motion fighting as youll see in the matrix trilogychow is a good director bringing a variety of skills as both an action and comedy director he knows how to balance the two to amusing effect he knows how to surprise us with comedic timing but also exactly what makes us think ooh cool instead of gore he manages the effect of gruesome violence without showing it by great set up and then cutting away at the last secondsometimes the style is too forced or the humor too cheesy but this is a very unique action movie with silly characters from the kung fu tradition not the glamorous look of films such as crouching tiger hidden dragon and hero this is one of those action movies with misfits not serious heroes with something to provethough chow has yet to follow up he might be talented enough to bridge the western world with the art of the chinese not american kung fu movie in a way that hasnt been done since bruce lee praying on our love for stylish and glitzy action with a better budget the cgi could be done to better effect and even the stunts too,comedy
when the dastardly axe gang take on the impoverished residents of pig sty alley they are making a mistake they will never forget and nor will we for while were all used to the exaggerated violence of the martial arts movie this takes a new level in a film that owes more to tom and jerry than it does to any attempt to depict realism in fighting or emotions nor is this necessarily a bad thing the film has an original streak of humour running through it and in an an age when a succession of directors have competed with each other to find the inner darkness in batman its maybe not so bad to watch something unashamedly comicbook in nature with no attempt made to hint at hidden depths personally i liked it although after the first few minutes the films essential premise is already completely revealed its daft but fun,comedy
this is one of those few movies that comes out every few years and is worth buying to put on your dvd shelf to watch over and over againis everything you would want in a camp action movie it is clever funny and can be seriously good fun with action some of the sequences are done with such an artistic flairthe character development is fantastic the writer carefully and economically fleshes out many characters by not only their dialog but their actionsthis is the army of darkness of martial arts movies it is full of memorable scenes that make you want to watch it more,comedy
is a very entertaining film and i am a sucker for good material arts this is a good example of hong kong cinema being able to challenge hollywood moviesthe plot of the film is that 1930s shanghai and the axe gang runs the streets of the city most people live in fear of the gang expect for a poor district known as pig sly the axe gang get humiliated when they end up fighting in the district and found out the most of the citizens are expert material artists the axe gang are obviously annoyed and hire a number of assassins to take on the district which leads to some epic fightsthe film is very surreal and cartoony in its approach which i think is very fitting it is very humorous the language barrier was not a problem it also has homages to other films like the blood in the corridor scene from the shinning and the fight at the end with the axe gang which was similar to the fight with the agent smiths in the matrix reloaded the best scene in the two other matrix films the material arts fights were really good the choreographer was yuen wo ping who worked on the matrix kill bill and fearless it is also a homage to jackie chan movies but i think it better then jackie chan i admit im not much of a fan i like him as material artist but not as an actor it is violence and like other modern material arts films from hong kong and china it does focus on detail and is very theatricalis a good film especially for fans of material art films jackie chan and asian cinema i believe that cinema from the far east china japan hong kong and south korea produce some of the best cinema in the world,comedy
for some reason i thought there maybe more dancing with having a name like but gladly it did not it had action action action when watching this film the time will fly by because there is little time to rest the fights are very well choreographed and blended perfectly with the modern affects you will see in the new martial arts films but i have to say that this is not just another film produced on that bandwagon as this film has a jet lee type fight scenes with a jackie chan twist the story line is still the same old classic though of a bum who makes good in the end with out giving to much away in case you see it and you should see it i consider the end boss to be one of the best around in which he has a very very special gong fu style all in all i have given this film a 9 out of 10,comedy
gong fu is put to main genres action and comedy actually this one is a lot more of course first of all this is a action movie that kicks ass somehow a modern and truly hilarious kung fu movie gong fu is a movie for everyone its a joy for movie fanatics because of its many movie connection even though you wouldnt know much of kung fu movie history this one gives you idea how much better it is than mainstream us action kickin thingsmost important thing in gong fu is mr chow how he directed and wrote it and how astonishing he is in the leading role of sing its easy to understand why he has made so many comedies chow is absolutely real comedian he is just so funnyanother important thing is the chinese language that is spoken in this cartoonish violence and real bad ass kung fu and the actors speak chinese gong fu is ultimately cool smooth and complete hustlehong kong movie is alive and doing well china produces great films looking forward to successes to come,comedy
